The new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms for most people. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness or death. TOP OF THE HOUR: "" Montana outbreak tied to golf and country club developed by Charles Schwab "" Pasta factory in Spokane reports virus outbreak as Washington state prepare to reopen "" Sunday's New York Times devotes entire front page to list of COVID-19 victims. "" Protesters gather outside California's state Capitol to rally against stay-at-home orders. "" New York state records 24-hour death total under 100. ___ HAMILTON, Mont. "" An outbreak of COVID-19 in western Montana is tied to an exclusive golf and country club developed by financial executive Charles Schwab. Stock Farm Club General Manager Steve Buck says the eight people who tested positive for COVID-19 in Ravalli County are employees of the club near Hamilton. One person had been hospitalized and seven others remained in isolation on Saturday. The health department has said it was believed the first person who tested positive had contracted the respiratory virus outside the county. Montana reported no new positive COVID-19 tests from samples run on Friday. The state has had 479 confirmed cases. ___ ANCHORAGE, Alaska -- The Alaska Baseball League has canceled its summer season, as the future of sports worldwide remains uncertain during the coronavirus pandemic. The summer league season was scheduled to begin on June 29. The league website says this season will be canceled to keep everyone safe from exposure to COVID-19. KTVA-TV reported that if competition resumed on time there would have been travel and housing challenges during the seven weeks of play. The five-team league is made up of college players from mostly the Lower 48 but also from places as far away as Taiwan. ___ SPOKANE, Wash. "" A pasta company has announced there was a coronavirus outbreak at its Spokane factory as Washington state prepares to reopen parts of its economy. The Spokesman-Review reported that Philadelphia Macaroni Company Inc. said in a statement Friday that 72 workers were tested for COVID-19 and 24 were positive. Health officials say there was an increase in Spokane County with 31 new positive cases between Thursday and Friday. Company officials say all of the factory employees have since been tested and the facility was disinfected. The company is working with the Spokane Regional Health District to conduct contact tracing and determine further prevention measures. ___ BEIJING "" China on Sunday reported three new confirmed cases of coronavirus. Two of the cases were brought from outside the country and one locally transmitted in the northeastern province of Jilin that has experienced a minor outbreak now apparently largely contained. No new deaths were reported and 79 people remain in treatment, with another 380 under isolation and monitoring for being suspected cases or having tested positive for COVID-19 without showing any symptoms. China has reported a total of 4,634 COVID-19 deaths out of 82,974 cases. ___ CANBERRA, Australia "" Government officials says six million Australians have downloaded a mobile telephone app that helps health authorities trace coronavirus infections Federal Health Minister Greg Hunt said the COVIDSafe app is playing a strong role in Australia's response to the pandemic and several countries have expressed interest in learning from its positive impacts. If a user is diagnosed, the app works to identify other users who have been in close proximity for 15 minutes or more in the previous three weeks. The government has said at least 40% of Australia's 26 million people need to use the app for it to be effective. There are approximately 17 million mobile phones in Australia. The government and states have been easing restrictions on travel and increased use of restaurants and bars in the past few weeks. Australia has recorded more than 7,100 cases of COVID-19, with 102 deaths. ___ NEW YORK "" The New York Times has devoted Sunday's entire front page to a long list of names of people who have died in the coronavirus pandemic. The names and brief descriptions culled from obituaries from around the country fill six columns under the headline 'U.S. Deaths Near 100,000, an Incalculable Loss,' with a subheadline reading: 'They Were Not Simply Names on a List. They Were Us.' The all-text list takes the place of the usual articles, photographs and graphics in an effort to convey the vastness and variety of lives lost, according to Simone Landon, assistant editor of the graphics desk. A tally kept by Johns Hopkins University says more than 96,000 people have died of COVID-19 in the United States. Tom Bodkin, chief creative officer of The Times, said he did not remember any front pages without images, though there have been pages with only graphics, during his 40 years at the newspaper. ___ SANTA FE, N.M. "" A New Mexico state official says gatherings of more than 100 people may not be possible for more than a year because of the coronavirus pandemic. Tourism Secretary Jen Paul Schroer said it could be a year or 18 months before there's either a vaccine or herd immunity. That creates the prospect that sports stadiums, concert halls and conference centers in the state could remain empty for months. The Santa Fe New Mexican reports that Schroer spoke during a webinar Thursday on reopening the state's hospitality industry. The state had nearly 6,800 cases of COVID-19 with 308 deaths as of Saturday. ___ SACRAMENTO, Calif. "" Hundreds of protesters rallied outside California's state Capitol on Saturday to protest stay-at-home orders even as residents entered the Memorial Day weekend with newly expanded options for leisure. California Highway Patrol officers closed the Capitol lawn to demonstrators, so speakers addressed the crowd from the back of a flatbed truck as an airplane flew above towing a banner with a picture of Gov. Gavin Newsom and the words 'End his tyranny!' Protesters waved dozens of flags and signs, many in support of President Donald Trump. Few people wore masks and there was little room for social distancing. The protest came as restrictions eased across much of the state. Some 45 of 58 counties have received permission to reopen most stores and many public spaces by meeting state standards for controlling the novel coronavirus. Authorities continue to warn people to practice social distancing and other anti-virus measures, noting that the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths continues to rise. ___ HAGATNA, Guam "" The Department of Agriculture in Guam has invited hunters to participate in a pig-hunting derby to provide food for families in need during the coronavirus pandemic. The Pacific Daily News reported that the department announced that the two-day derby is scheduled to begin next Saturday. The department released a statement saying the derby is intended to feed families, foster familial hunter development and reduce the feral pig population. Event organizers are working with mayors to distribute pigs whole and unprocessed to residents within their villages and provide safe handling guidelines. ___ RALEIGH, N.C. "" Coronavirus outbreaks at meat processing plants are forcing North Carolina farmers to euthanize 1.5 million chickens, according to a state official. Assistant Agriculture Commissioner Joe Reardon told The News & Observer that this is the first time during the pandemic that farmers in the state have had to euthanize their animals. Roughly a third of the 1.5 million chickens already had been killed, Reardon said. Chicken and hog farmers in other states also have been euthanizing millions of animals during the COVID-19 pandemic. North Carolina hog farmers have not taken steps to euthanize their animals, Reardon said. ___ FORT CAMPBELL, Ky. "" Eighteen soldiers assigned to the U.S. Army's 101st Airborne Division have returned to Fort Campbell after spending more than a month in New Jersey helping with COVID-19 response operations. Fort Campbell officials say the soldiers deployed April 14 to help provide logistical support for the response to the new coronavirus outbreak throughout the Northeast. The troops helped receive, process and move supplies, equipment and personnel in critical areas affected by the virus outbreak. The soldiers will undergo a precautionary quarantine under medical supervision. An official welcome-home event is being planned, officials said. The Fort Campbell Army post is located along the Kentucky-Tennessee border. ___ MINNEAPOLIS "" Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz is scrapping his 10-person limit on group gatherings and allowing churches to open at 25% occupancy if certain safety guidelines are met. Walz's decision comes after the state reported a record number of COVID-19 cases. He says the issue has been 'a challenging one' because large gatherings raise the risk of spreading the virus. Walz says he understands the toll the pandemic has taken on the spiritual health of residents. His new executive order applies only to religious gatherings and not receptions. While the leader of the Catholic Archdiocese of St. Paul and Minneapolis welcomed the change, the governor said parishes should not open if they don't feel they can meet safety measures. Archbishop Bernard Hebda said in a letter to parishioners that limiting gatherings to 10 people had 'burdened the Church's ability to fully meet the sacramental needs of our faithful.' ___ TALLAHASSEE, Fla. "" A woman who raised questions about Florida's COVID-19 data after being ousted as the data's curator had been reprimanded several times for violating Health Department policy, including for posting political commentary about the information, state records show. Rebekah Jones' comments over the past week and a half in emails to researchers, interviews with a handful of media outlets, and blog posts have sought to sow doubt about the credibility of the data now that she is no longer in that role. State health officials strenuously deny any issue with the information's accuracy as Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis seeks to make a data-driven case for a step-by-step reopening of the state's battered economy following safer-at-home orders. Jones has not alleged any tampering with data on deaths, hospital symptom surveillance, hospitalizations for COVID-19, numbers of new confirmed cases, or overall testing rates. She has, however, suggested Health Department managers wanted her to manipulate information to paint a rosier picture and that she pushed back. ___ SPRINGFIELD, Mo. "" A hairstylist served 84 clients over eight days recently while experiencing symptoms of coronavirus, Missouri health officials say. The Springfield-Greene County Health Department said in a news briefing that the stylist worked between May 12-20 and announced in a Facebook post Saturday that 56 other clients were potentially exposed by a second stylist who worked five shifts from May 16-20 while experiencing very mild symptoms of the coronavirus. All clients of the two stylists wore masks and will be tested. The owner of the business said in a statement that the salon will be closed until it goes through sanitizing and deep cleaning The state health department reported 218 new confirmed cases of the new coronavirus, bringing the total to 11,558 since the pandemic began. That was the largest one-day total since 319 cases were reported May 1. Ten new deaths brought that total to 671. ___ RALEIGH, N.C. "" North Carolina has failed to change its election laws to ensure that voters can safely cast ballots during the COVID-19 pandemic, voting rights advocates claim in a federal lawsuit. The nonprofit Democracy North Carolina and the League of Women Voters of North Carolina sued Friday on behalf of several elderly or disabled residents whose medical conditions make them more vulnerable to coronavirus. The lawsuit alleges that several aspects of North Carolina's absentee vote-by-mail requirements are unconstitutional because voters will have to risk exposure to COVID-19 to successfully vote. For example, mail-in absentee voters are required to complete the ballot in the presence of two witnesses or a notary. State law also requires voters to submit their registration applications at least 25 days before the election or else register in-person at an early voting site, the suit notes. The lawsuit says that will result in millions of state residents either losing their right to vote or being forced to compromise their health in order to cast a ballot. The state Board of Elections and other state officials are named as defendants. ___ STURGIS, S.D. "" The mayor of Sturgis says city officials can't stop people from coming to the annual motorcycle gathering in the Black Hills of South Dakota, regardless of the new coronavirus. The 80th Sturgis Motorcycle Rally is scheduled for Aug. 7-16. The City Council has said it would make an official decision in mid-June on whether to go forward with hosting the event, the Rapid City Journal reported. Mayor Mark Carstensen said in a Facebook video that 'tourism is coming' to the Black Hills and Sturgis. A manager with The Hotel Sturgis said all 22 rooms have been booked for the week of the rally and there is a waiting list. ___ DOVER, Del. "" The University of Delaware says it is laying off more than 1,100 part-time employees, mostly students, in a move to cut costs during the COVID-19 pandemic. The News Journal reports that students account for 805 of the 1,146 part-time employees who were notified of their layoffs on Thursday. An email to employees said the layoffs, which take effect on June 1, do not affect adjunct faculty, graduate students, work-study students or employees whose wages are paid through external funding. But many adjunct professors will not have a teaching position in the fall due to a hiring freeze. In April, the university announced that it faced a $65 million budget shortfall due to pandemic's financial toll, including revenue lost from prorated housing and canceled athletic events. The university hopes to reopen campus in phases starting June 1 with certain research facilities. ___ BAGHDAD "" Iraq's Health Ministry is reporting the steepest single-day spike in confirmed coronavirus cases since the government began recording cases in late February. The ministry reported 308 new cases Saturday, one day ahead of celebrations to mark the end of the holy month of Ramadan. Curfew hours had been relaxed during the month of fasting, which contributed to higher daily rates of infection. According to ministry figures, more than 4,200 people have tested positive for the virus in Iraq. At least 152 people have died. Roads have been clogged with traffic and supermarkets and shops have been packed with people preparing for the celebrations, likely contributing to the increase in infections. ___ ALBANY, N.Y. "" New York state reported its lowest number of daily coronavirus deaths in weeks in what Gov. Andrew Cuomo described Saturday as a critical benchmark. The daily death tally was 84 after a peak of 799 on April 8. Reducing the state's daily death count to fewer than 100 seemed almost impossible several weeks ago, the Democratic governor said. That figure has remained stubbornly high even amid other signs of encouragement. 'In my head, I was always looking to get under 100,' Cuomo said. 'For me, it's a sign that we're making real progress.' The number of hospitalized patients in the state that has been the epicenter of the pandemic in the U.S. continued to fall, dropping to over 4,600. Cuomo also announced that the region along the Hudson River north of New York City and south of Albany is set to begin reopening Tuesday, and that Long Island could follow suit Wednesday. ___ ATHENS "" Two fatalities from COVID-19 were reported in Greece during the most recent 24-hour period, bringing the death toll to 171, health authorities announced Saturday. Another three new infections have been recorded since Friday afternoon, raising the nation's total to 2,876. The number of patients on ventilators stands at 20, while 99 have left intensive care. Greek authorities say they have performed 152,998 tests for the disease. ___ Follow AP news coverage of the coronavirus pandemic at https://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak",0.0

No new deaths were reported and 79 people remain in treatment, with another 380 under isolation and monitoring for being suspected cases or having tested positive for COVID-19 without showing any symptoms. China has reported a total of 4,634 COVID-19 deaths out of 82,974 cases. ___ CANBERRA, Australia "" Government officials says six million Australians have downloaded a mobile telephone app that helps health authorities trace coronavirus infections Federal Health Minister Greg Hunt said the COVIDSafe app is playing a strong role in Australia's response to the pandemic and several countries have expressed interest in learning from its positive impacts. If a user is diagnosed, the app works to identify other users who have been in close proximity for 15 minutes or more in the previous three weeks. The government has said at least 40% of Australia's 26 million people need to use the app for it to be effective. There are approximately 17 million mobile phones in Australia. The government and states have been easing restrictions on travel and increased use of restaurants and bars in the past few weeks. Australia has recorded more than 7,100 cases of COVID-19, with 102 deaths. ___ NEW YORK "" The New York Times has devoted Sunday's entire front page to a long list of names of people who have died in the coronavirus pandemic. The names and brief descriptions culled from obituaries from around the country fill six columns under the headline 'U.S. Deaths Near 100,000, an Incalculable Loss,' with a subheadline reading: 'They Were Not Simply Names on a List. They Were Us.' The all-text list takes the place of the usual articles, photographs and graphics in an effort to convey the vastness and variety of lives lost, according to Simone Landon, assistant editor of the graphics desk. A tally kept by Johns Hopkins University says more than 96,000 people have died of COVID-19 in the United States. Tom Bodkin, chief creative officer of The Times, said he did not remember any front pages without images, though there have been pages with only graphics, during his 40 years at the newspaper. ___ SANTA FE, N.M. "" A New Mexico state official says gatherings of more than 100 people may not be possible for more than a year because of the coronavirus pandemic. Tourism Secretary Jen Paul Schroer said it could be a year or 18 months before there's either a vaccine or herd immunity. That creates the prospect that sports stadiums, concert halls and conference centers in the state could remain empty for months. The Santa Fe New Mexican reports that Schroer spoke during a webinar Thursday on reopening the state's hospitality industry. The state had nearly 6,800 cases of COVID-19 with 308 deaths as of Saturday. ___ SACRAMENTO, Calif. "" Hundreds of protesters rallied outside California's state Capitol on Saturday to protest stay-at-home orders even as residents entered the Memorial Day weekend with newly expanded options for leisure. California Highway Patrol officers closed the Capitol lawn to demonstrators, so speakers addressed the crowd from the back of a flatbed truck as an airplane flew above towing a banner with a picture of Gov. Gavin Newsom and the words 'End his tyranny!' Protesters waved dozens of flags and signs, many in support of President Donald Trump. Few people wore masks and there was little room for social distancing. The protest came as restrictions eased across much of the state. Some 45 of 58 counties have received permission to reopen most stores and many public spaces by meeting state standards for controlling the novel coronavirus. Authorities continue to warn people to practice social distancing and other anti-virus measures, noting that the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths continues to rise. ___ HAGATNA, Guam "" The Department of Agriculture in Guam has invited hunters to participate in a pig-hunting derby to provide food for families in need during the coronavirus pandemic. The Pacific Daily News reported that the department announced that the two-day derby is scheduled to begin next Saturday. The department released a statement saying the derby is intended to feed families, foster familial hunter development and reduce the feral pig population. Event organizers are working with mayors to distribute pigs whole and unprocessed to residents within their villages and provide safe handling guidelines. ___ RALEIGH, N.C. "" Coronavirus outbreaks at meat processing plants are forcing North Carolina farmers to euthanize 1.5 million chickens, according to a state official. Assistant Agriculture Commissioner Joe Reardon told The News & Observer that this is the first time during the pandemic that farmers in the state have had to euthanize their animals. Roughly a third of the 1.5 million chickens already had been killed, Reardon said. Chicken and hog farmers in other states also have been euthanizing millions of animals during the COVID-19 pandemic. North Carolina hog farmers have not taken steps to euthanize their animals, Reardon said. ___ FORT CAMPBELL, Ky. "" Eighteen soldiers assigned to the U.S. Army's 101st Airborne Division have returned to Fort Campbell after spending more than a month in New Jersey helping with COVID-19 response operations. Fort Campbell officials say the soldiers deployed April 14 to help provide logistical support for the response to the new coronavirus outbreak throughout the Northeast. The troops helped receive, process and move supplies, equipment and personnel in critical areas affected by the virus outbreak. The soldiers will undergo a precautionary quarantine under medical supervision. An official welcome-home event is being planned, officials said. The Fort Campbell Army post is located along the Kentucky-Tennessee border. ___ MINNEAPOLIS "" Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz is scrapping his 10-person limit on group gatherings and allowing churches to open at 25% occupancy if certain safety guidelines are met. Walz's decision comes after the state reported a record number of COVID-19 cases. He says the issue has been 'a challenging one' because large gatherings raise the risk of spreading the virus. Walz says he understands the toll the pandemic has taken on the spiritual health of residents. His new executive order applies only to religious gatherings and not receptions. While the leader of the Catholic Archdiocese of St. Paul and Minneapolis welcomed the change, the governor said parishes should not open if they don't feel they can meet safety measures. Archbishop Bernard Hebda said in a letter to parishioners that limiting gatherings to 10 people had 'burdened the Church's ability to fully meet the sacramental needs of our faithful.' ___ TALLAHASSEE, Fla. "" A woman who raised questions about Florida's COVID-19 data after being ousted as the data's curator had been reprimanded several times for violating Health Department policy, including for posting political commentary about the information, state records show. Rebekah Jones' comments over the past week and a half in emails to researchers, interviews with a handful of media outlets, and blog posts have sought to sow doubt about the credibility of the data now that she is no longer in that role. State health officials strenuously deny any issue with the information's accuracy as Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis seeks to make a data-driven case for a step-by-step reopening of the state's battered economy following safer-at-home orders. Jones has not alleged any tampering with data on deaths, hospital symptom surveillance, hospitalizations for COVID-19, numbers of new confirmed cases, or overall testing rates. She has, however, suggested Health Department managers wanted her to manipulate information to paint a rosier picture and that she pushed back. ___ SPRINGFIELD, Mo. "" A hairstylist served 84 clients over eight days recently while experiencing symptoms of coronavirus, Missouri health officials say. The Springfield-Greene County Health Department said in a news briefing that the stylist worked between May 12-20 and announced in a Facebook post Saturday that 56 other clients were potentially exposed by a second stylist who worked five shifts from May 16-20 while experiencing very mild symptoms of the coronavirus. All clients of the two stylists wore masks and will be tested. The owner of the business said in a statement that the salon will be closed until it goes through sanitizing and deep cleaning The state health department reported 218 new confirmed cases of the new coronavirus, bringing the total to 11,558 since the pandemic began. That was the largest one-day total since 319 cases were reported May 1. Ten new deaths brought that total to 671. ___ RALEIGH, N.C. "" North Carolina has failed to change its election laws to ensure that voters can safely cast ballots during the COVID-19 pandemic, voting rights advocates claim in a federal lawsuit. The nonprofit Democracy North Carolina and the League of Women Voters of North Carolina sued Friday on behalf of several elderly or disabled residents whose medical conditions make them more vulnerable to coronavirus. The lawsuit alleges that several aspects of North Carolina's absentee vote-by-mail requirements are unconstitutional because voters will have to risk exposure to COVID-19 to successfully vote. For example, mail-in absentee voters are required to complete the ballot in the presence of two witnesses or a notary. State law also requires voters to submit their registration applications at least 25 days before the election or else register in-person at an early voting site, the suit notes. The lawsuit says that will result in millions of state residents either losing their right to vote or being forced to compromise their health in order to cast a ballot. The state Board of Elections and other state officials are named as defendants. ___ STURGIS, S.D. "" The mayor of Sturgis says city officials can't stop people from coming to the annual motorcycle gathering in the Black Hills of South Dakota, regardless of the new coronavirus. The 80th Sturgis Motorcycle Rally is scheduled for Aug. 7-16. The City Council has said it would make an official decision in mid-June on whether to go forward with hosting the event, the Rapid City Journal reported. Mayor Mark Carstensen said in a Facebook video that 'tourism is coming' to the Black Hills and Sturgis. A manager with The Hotel Sturgis said all 22 rooms have been booked for the week of the rally and there is a waiting list. ___ DOVER, Del. "" The University of Delaware says it is laying off more than 1,100 part-time employees, mostly students, in a move to cut costs during the COVID-19 pandemic. The News Journal reports that students account for 805 of the 1,146 part-time employees who were notified of their layoffs on Thursday. An email to employees said the layoffs, which take effect on June 1, do not affect adjunct faculty, graduate students, work-study students or employees whose wages are paid through external funding. But many adjunct professors will not have a teaching position in the fall due to a hiring freeze. In April, the university announced that it faced a $65 million budget shortfall due to pandemic's financial toll, including revenue lost from prorated housing and canceled athletic events. The university hopes to reopen campus in phases starting June 1 with certain research facilities. ___ BAGHDAD "" Iraq's Health Ministry is reporting the steepest single-day spike in confirmed coronavirus cases since the government began recording cases in late February. The ministry reported 308 new cases Saturday, one day ahead of celebrations to mark the end of the holy month of Ramadan. Curfew hours had been relaxed during the month of fasting, which contributed to higher daily rates of infection. According to ministry figures, more than 4,200 people have tested positive for the virus in Iraq. At least 152 people have died. Roads have been clogged with traffic and supermarkets and shops have been packed with people preparing for the celebrations, likely contributing to the increase in infections. ___ ALBANY, N.Y. "" New York state reported its lowest number of daily coronavirus deaths in weeks in what Gov. Andrew Cuomo described Saturday as a critical benchmark. The daily death tally was 84 after a peak of 799 on April 8. Reducing the state's daily death count to fewer than 100 seemed almost impossible several weeks ago, the Democratic governor said. That figure has remained stubbornly high even amid other signs of encouragement. 'In my head, I was always looking to get under 100,' Cuomo said. 'For me, it's a sign that we're making real progress.' The number of hospitalized patients in the state that has been the epicenter of the pandemic in the U.S. continued to fall, dropping to over 4,600. Cuomo also announced that the region along the Hudson River north of New York City and south of Albany is set to begin reopening Tuesday, and that Long Island could follow suit Wednesday. ___ ATHENS "" Two fatalities from COVID-19 were reported in Greece during the most recent 24-hour period, bringing the death toll to 171, health authorities announced Saturday.

The Palestinians, with wide international backing, seek the entire West Bank as the heartland of a future independent state. Annexing large chunks of this territory would all but destroy the faint remaining hopes of a two-state solution. In an apparent reference to the friendly administration of President Donald Trump, Netanyahu said Israel had a 'historic opportunity' to redraw the Mideast map that could not be missed. Israeli media quoted him as saying he would act in July. 'This is an opportunity that we will not let pass,' he told members of his conservative Likud party. He added that the 'historic opportunity' to annex the West Bank had never before occurred since Israel's founding in 1948. The comments threatened to push Israel closer to a confrontation with Arab and European partners, and could deepen what is becoming a growing partisan divide over Israel in Washington. Israel captured the West Bank in the 1967 Mideast war. It has settled nearly 500,000 Jewish settlers in the territory, but never formally claimed it as an Israeli territory due to stiff international opposition. But the Trump administration has taken a much softer line toward Israeli settlements than its predecessors. Trump's Mideast team is dominated by advisers with close ties to the settlements, and his Mideast plan, unveiled in January, envisions leaving some 30% of the territory under permanent Israeli control while giving the Palestinians expanded autonomy in the rest of the area. The Palestinians have rejected the plan, saying it is unfairly biased toward Israel. With Trump's re-election prospects uncertain this November, Israeli hard-liners have urged Netanyahu to move ahead with annexation quickly. The Israeli leader's new coalition deal includes an official clause allowing him to present his annexation plan to the government in July. Netanyahu told party members in a closed-door meeting that 'we have a target date for July and we don't intend to change it,"" Likud officials said. The plan has already exposed a partisan divide in Washington. Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee in the U.S. presidential elections, recently said that annexation would 'choke off' hopes for a two-state solution. 18 Democratic senators warned in a letter this week that annexation could harm U.S.-Israeli ties. The EU's foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, has said annexation would violate international law and vowed to use 'all our diplomatic capacities' to stop it. Closer to home, the Palestinians last week cut off security ties "" a valuable tool in a shared struggled against Islamic militants "" with Israel to protest the annexation plan. Saudi Arabia, an influential Arab country that maintains behind-the-scenes relations with Israel, announced its 'rejection of the Israeli measures and plans to annex Palestinian lands.' The Arab League has condemned it as a 'war crime,' and both Jordan and Egypt "" the only two Arab countries at peace with Israel "" have harshly criticized it. Netanyahu spoke a day after beginning his trial on corruption charges. The prime minister launched a blistering tirade against the country's legal system when he arrived at court, accusing police, prosecutors and media of conspiring to oust him. As he spoke, hundreds of supporters cheered outside. Speaking to Likud on Monday, Netanyahu said he was 'very moved' by the support. Critics have said his attacks on the justice system risk undermining the country's democratic foundations.",0.0

The Palestinians, with wide international backing, seek the entire West Bank as the heartland of a future independent state. Annexing large chunks of this territory would all but destroy the faint remaining hopes of a two-state solution. In an apparent reference to the friendly administration of President Donald Trump, Netanyahu said Israel had a 'historic opportunity' to redraw the Mideast map that could not be missed.

Israel captured the West Bank in the 1967 Mideast war. It has settled nearly 500,000 Jewish settlers in the territory, but never formally claimed it as an Israeli territory due to stiff international opposition.

Now, some 250,000 registered migrant laborers in Lebanon "" maids, garbage collectors, farm hands and construction workers "" are growing more desperate as a crippling economic and financial crisis sets in, coupled with coronavirus restrictions. Lebanon's unprecedented foreign currency crisis means that many migrants have not been paid for months or that the value of salaries is down by more than half. Others have lost their jobs after employers dumped them on the streets or outside their embassies. 'We are invisible,' said Banchi Yimer, an Ethiopian former domestic worker who founded a group that campaigns for domestic workers' rights in Lebanon. 'We don't even exist for our governments, not just the Lebanese government.' In just three days, she said, 20 Ethiopian domestic workers were abandoned by their sponsors and left outside the embassy. A video she posted showed women with as little as a backpack or a purse, lined up along the walls of the embassy "" some sitting on the floor. The pandemic delivered just the latest blow to a Lebanese economy, already devastated by a financial crisis brought on by decades of corruption and mismanagement. In recent weeks, the Lebanese pound, pegged to the dollar for more than two decades, has lost 60% of its value against the dollar and prices of basic goods soared. Unemployment has risen to 35% and an estimated 45% of the country's population is now below the poverty line. In this crisis, migrant workers are among the most vulnerable. Among them are 180,000 domestic workers, most of them women and many from Ethiopia and the Philippines. Thousands live illegally, after escaping their employers to whom they were tied under an ill-reputed sponsorship system, known in Arabic as 'kafala,' which dates back to the 1960s. Many are trapped, unable to go home, because they cannot afford the exorbitant costs of repatriation flights or because global air travel is severely restricted. Their plight is similar to that of migrant workers in other countries, including foreign laborers in oil-rich Gulf Arab states who now find themselves jobless, as COVID-19 stalks their labor camps. In the Lebanese capital of Beirut, the financial chaos has added to their despair. On Saturday, a Filipina domestic worker took her own life a day after arriving at a shelter run by the Philippines Embassy for workers waiting to return home after losing their jobs. In a statement Monday, the embassy said she died after jumping from a room she was sharing with two others. Both the Philippines Embassy and Lebanese authorities said they were investigating the death. Suspected suicides or escape attempts of foreign household workers have become a frequent occurrence in Lebanon, with local reports recording at least one incident a month. Such desperate acts are often blamed on the sponsorship system, which rights groups say creates near slave-like conditions. Some employers do not allow their helpers to go out on the street alone or have a day off. Domestic workers are not protected by labor law and are often shackled in a 24-7 work schedule with no right to resign. 'Some of their employers abuse them mentally physically and there is no law to protect them. Their employers ... treat them like slaves,' Brihanu said. A 2016 International Labor Organization study found that out of 1,200 employers surveyed, more than 94% withheld their workers' passports. Last week, security forces violently quelled a protest by Bangladeshi sanitation workers who were demanding an adjustment of their salaries to new market rates. The pandemic has also taken its toll. A few dozen foreign workers living in overcrowded apartments in Beirut have tested positive for the coronavirus. Riot police are often deployed outside their buildings to enforce isolation. Last week, Ethiopian workers staged a symbolic demonstration outside their embassy to demand free repatriation. 'We don't have the power to bring a plane and to take out everybody from this country. I wish we can do that,' said Tsigereda Brihanu, an Ethiopian activist with Egna Legna, Yimer's organization. 'Regular life in Lebanon is very difficult even to survive. It is not worth it to stay here.' One Ethiopian worker said that even though her sponsor still pays her salary, she is already checking into going home because she knows the dollars will run out and prices will continue to increase. 'Lebanon's finished,' she said, declining to give her name in order to speak freely. The virus lockdown has exacerbated work conditions. Some workers are not able to communicate with their own families and friends, the hours are much longer and the demands by employers are unrealistic, said Zeina Mezher of the International Labor Organization. 'They say that we are all in the storm, but it doesn't affect us all in the same way,' she said. Yimer, who founded Egna Legna in 2017, is now in Canada, where the group is registered as a non-profit organization, because it is illegal for domestic workers to be activists in Lebanon, and the government has refused to register a union for them. Egna Legna, meaning 'from us migrants to us migrants' in Amharic, Ethiopia's official language, now offers food packages for some who lost their jobs and helps others pay rent. 'I have not worked for nearly three months,' said Kumari, a household worker from Sri Lanka.

His death, which occurred Monday night after a struggle with police officers, was under investigation by the FBI and state agents. Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo, speaking to reporters Tuesday morning, was asked about the use of the knee on the man's neck during the arrest. ""We clearly have policies in place regarding placing someone under control,"" Arradondo said, stating that taking a look at what happened and how those policies apply ""will be part of the full investigation we'll do internally."" Officers were called about 8 p.m. Monday to investigate a report of a forgery at a business, according to police spokesman John Elder. Police found the man, believed to be in his 40s, matching the suspect's description in his car. ""He was ordered to step from his car. After he got out, he physically resisted officers,"" Elder said in a statement. ""Officers were able to get the suspect into handcuffs and noted he appeared to be suffering medical distress."" The man, who was not identified, was taken by ambulance to Hennepin County Medical Center where he died a short time later, police said. The name of the officer seen kneeling on his neck wasn't immediately released. The Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension has joined the FBI in its investigation. All body camera footage has been turned over to the BCA, which investigates most police shootings and in-custody deaths. The officers involved have been put on paid administrative leave, per department protocol. Nekima Levy-Armstrong, a prominent local activist, said watching the footage that was shared on social media made her ""sick to her stomach"" and she said it's another example of police brutality toward African American men, the Star Tribune reported. ""Whatever the man may have done should not have ended in a death sentence,"" she said. ""What started as an alleged economic incident once again turned deadly for a black man."" Levy-Armstrong said it reminded her of the Eric Garner case. He was an unarmed New York man who died in 2014 after he was placed in a chokehold by police and pleaded for his life saying he couldn't breathe. A grand jury later decided against indicting the officers involved, sparking protests around the country. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey on Tuesday morning urged those who might protest to take precautions amid the coronavirus outbreak. He said there is a ""need to make sure everyone voicing their opinion is staying safe,"" and he asked potential protesters to practice social distancing. ""If you're sad, I get it, if you're angry, that makes complete sense, if you feel the need to protest, of course, we want to make sure people are able to express themselves,"" Frey said. ""There is another danger out there right now, which is COVID-19."" Police in Minneapolis have come under scrutiny in recent years for deadly run-ins with citizens. A 24-year-old black man, Jamar Clark, was shot in the head and died in 2015 after a confrontation with two white officers responding to a reported assault. A county prosecutor declined to prosecute the officers, saying Clark was struggling for one of the officers' gun when he was shot.

The city's chief executive, Carrie Lam, told reporters that there was 'no need for us to worry"" over the move being considered by China's ceremonial National People's Congress. 'Hong Kong has proven that we uphold and preserve those values,"" Lam said. 'Hong Kong needs this piece of legislation for the bigger benefit of the great majority of Hong Kong people.' Lam also said that transit service would resume at Hong Kong's international airport on June 1, but that foreigners would still be banned from entering the city as part of measures to prevent a new wave of coronavirus infections. In Washington, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said Tuesday that President Donald Trump is ""displeased with China's efforts and that it's hard to see how Hong Kong can remain a financial hub, if China takes over.' She declined to elaborate when asked to explain the statement further. The move by China to pass the legislation signals the central government's determination to take greater control of Hong Kong after months of pro-democracy protests last year. Beijing has appointed new representatives in Hong Kong who follow the hard line laid down by Chinese President Xi Jinping, who is also the head of the ruling Communist Party. Such a move has long been under consideration and was hastened by last year's street protests in the former British colony, which was returned to Chinese rule in 1997. Beijing promised that the territory could retain its own relatively liberal civil, legal and economic systems that contrast starkly with the much more centrally controlled and authoritarian system in mainland China. Some 'foreign politicians' have 'expressed untrue opinions' about the plan to impose the law on Hong Kong, Lam said, without giving details. She repeated claims that the law would only target 'a minority,' citing concerns about terrorism and subversion. Protesters have returned to Hong Kong's streets to oppose the legislation, with thousands turning out on Sunday as police fired tear gas and deployed a water cannon to disperse the crowds. On Tuesday, over 100 protesters gathered at a luxury shopping mall in Hong Kong's Central business district, condemning Lam and her administration. The protests are a continuation of a monthslong pro-democracy movement that began last year and has at times descended into violence between police and demonstrators. Hong Kong's government is bound by Article 23 of the Basic Law "" its mini-constitution "" to enact laws to prohibit any act of treason, secession, sedition or subversion against China. It proposed legislation to do so in 2003, but withdrew it after hundreds of thousands of people came out to protest. Beijing has increasingly pushed for measures such as punishment for disrespecting the Chinese national flag or anthem "" as often seen at soccer games "" along with a boost to pro-China patriotic-themed education in schools. However, opposition in Hong Kong's Legislative Council makes it unlikely a national security bill could pass at the local level, prompting Beijing to utilize what some describe as dubious legal grounds to force the measures through at the national level. The Chinese public is largely seen as backing Xi's tough approach to foreign policy challenges, including criticism from the U.S., Australia and others. Xi has made an unswerving line on national interests a key signature of his rule since taking over leadership of the ruling party in 2012. Abroad, however, that policy has further bolstered concerns about China's intentions to dominate markets and assert its influence in the Asia-Pacific region. That may ultimately add to Xi's difficulties in reviving economic growth and jobs at a time when global markets are partly shut due to the coronavirus pandemic and skepticism toward China runs high.",0.0

(AP) "" Vowing not to back down after armed protesters gathered near his home and hung him in effigy, the governor of Kentucky on Tuesday condemned their use of 'fear and terror' in a demonstration fueled by coronavirus restrictions. Gov. Andy Beshear referred to the protesters as a mob in sharply condemning the weekend rally that spread to the Governor's Mansion, where his children play. And the Democratic governor bluntly accused some Kentucky politicians of culpability for attending a previous rally. 'Let's start by calling it what it was and what it is "" actions aimed at creating fear and terror,"" Beshear said of Sunday's rally. 'Crossing over barriers, standing on the other side of the glass from where I raise my kids and hanging me in an effigy, that's an action intended to use fear to get their way."" Beshear said he would not be deterred by the demonstration. He has stressed the need to reopen the state safely, phasing in business restarts amid the health crisis. Non-essential retail stores and restaurant dining rooms have been among the reopenings, though with restrictions meant to adhere to social distancing. Beshear also has strongly urged the wearing of masks. 'I will not be afraid,"" he said at his daily coronavirus briefing. 'I will not be bullied. And I will not back down, not to them and not to anybody else.' The effigy was hung in a tree near the State Capitol during what was billed as a protest rally in defense of constitutional rights, including the right to bear arms. The rally turned into a protest against coronavirus restrictions and Beshear's administration, according to media reports, with protesters chanting outside the Governor's Mansion for him to come outside. Beshear said Tuesday that the protesters have been 'embraced and emboldened' by some elected leaders. A handful of Republican lawmakers had attended a previous rally. Some prominent GOP leaders condemned the actions at Sunday's rally. Earlier Tuesday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell denounced the protesters' actions as 'completely outrageous and unacceptable.' Without naming anyone, the governor urged elected officials to no longer 'cater"" to such groups, saying: 'You cannot fan the flames and then condemn the fire."" 'You can't wait until something nasty and horrible happens to then claim it's wrong while you've catered the support of certain groups for votes or other reasons,' he added. Beshear said he doesn't regret moving his wife and their two children to the Governor's Mansion, located across the street from the statehouse grounds, but said security measures will be reviewed. He wondered aloud how the protesters would react 'if someone else who is armed walked up on their patio?"""" 'They walked up and stood on the front porch, and there, just a window pane away from where my kids play, the mob chanted and heckled,"" Beshear said. 'Thankfully, my kids weren't there that day.

'The Kentucky State Police does not comment on the level of security provided to protect the governor, nor any inquiries that we receive regarding these efforts,' said Sgt. Josh Lawson, commander of the agency's public affairs branch, speaking with the Lexington Herald-Leader. Beshear, the son of a former Kentucky governor, is known for his disciplined, even-keeled style. But he let his emotions show when pressed by reporters about the incident. 'I'm not going to let a bunch of jerks change the way that we're living our life,"" he said. Beshear made another statement about the protest during his briefing.

(AP Photo/Jim Mone) MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — To the general public, the video of a white police officer pressing his knee into the neck of a shirtless black man prone on the street, crying out for help until he finally stopped moving, was horrifying. Four officers were fired a day after George Floyd’s death, a stunning and swift move by the Minneapolis chief with the mayor’s full backing. But despite their dismissal, whether the incident will be considered criminal, or even excessive force, is a more complicated question that will likely take months to investigate. The officers were dismissed soon after a bystander’s video taken outside a south Minneapolis grocery store Monday night showed an officer kneeling on the handcuffed man’s neck, even after he pleaded that he could not breathe and stopped moving. Mayor Jacob Frey announced the firings on Twitter, saying: “This is the right call.” The FBI and state law enforcement were investigating Floyd’s death, which immediately drew comparisons to the case of Eric Garner, an unarmed black man who died in 2014 in New York after he was placed in a chokehold by police and pleaded for his life, saying he could not breathe. But in the Garner case, local prosecutors, the NYPD’s internal affairs unit, and the Justice Department all finished investigations into the case before the officer was ultimately fired. Garner’s family and activists spent years begging for the officer to be removed. The officers in the Minneapolis incident haven’t even been publicly identified, though one defense attorney has confirmed he is representing Derek Chauvin, the officer seen with his knee on Floyd’s neck. The attorney, Tom Kelly, declined to comment further. The police union asked the public to wait for the investigation to take its course and not to “rush to judgment and immediately condemn our officers.” Messages left with the union after the firings were not returned. Police Chief Medaria Arradondo said the department would conduct a full internal investigation, and prosecutors will decide whether to file criminal charges against the officers involved. The Hennepin County Attorney’s Office said it was “shocked and saddened” by the video and pledged to handle the case fairly. Part of that investigation will likely focus on the intent of the officers, whether they meant to harm Floyd or whether it was a death that happened in the course of police work. The FBI was investigating whether the officers willfully deprived Floyd of his civil rights. News accounts show Chauvin was one of six officers who fired their weapons in the 2006 death of Wayne Reyes, whom police said pointed a sawed-off shotgun at officers after stabbing two people. Chauvin also shot and wounded a man in 2008 in a struggle after Chauvin and his partner responded to a reported domestic assault. Police did not immediately respond to a request for Chauvin’s service record. In Minneapolis, kneeling on a suspect’s neck is allowed under the department’s use-of-force policy for officers who have received training in how to compress a neck without applying direct pressure to the airway. It is considered a “non-deadly force option,” according to the department’s policy handbook. A chokehold is considered a deadly force option and involves someone obstructing the airway. According to the department’s use-of-force policy, officers are to use only an amount of force necessary that would be objectively reasonable. But two use-of-force experts told The Associated Press that the officer clearly restrained the man too long. They noted the man was under control and no longer fighting. Andrew Scott, a former Boca Raton, Florida, police chief who now testifies as an expert witness in use-of-force cases, called Floyd’s death “a combination of not being trained properly or disregarding their training.” “He couldn’t move. He was telling them he couldn’t breathe, and they ignored him,” Scott said. “I can’t even describe it. It was difficult to watch.” In a post on his Facebook page, the mayor, who is white, apologized Tuesday to the black community for the officer’s treatment of Floyd, 46, who worked security at a restaurant. “Being Black in America should not be a death sentence. For five minutes, we watched a white officer press his knee into a Black man’s neck. Five minutes. When you hear someone calling for help, you’re supposed to help. This officer failed in the most basic, human sense,” Frey posted. Police said the man matched the description of a suspect in a forgery case at a grocery store, and that he resisted arrest. The video starts with the shirtless man on the ground, and does not show what happened in the moments prior. The unidentified officer is kneeling on his neck, ignoring his pleas. “Please, please, please, I can’t breathe. Please, man,” said Floyd, who has his face against the pavement. Even in the coronavirus pandemic that has killed nearly 100,000 people in the U.S. and prompted police departments around the country to change how they’re doing work, the officers in the video aren’t wearing masks. In some cities, low-level arrests such as attempted forgery are skipped right now. Floyd also moans. One of the officers tells him to “relax.” Floyd calls for his mother and says: “My stomach hurts, my neck hurts, everything hurts … I can’t breathe.” As bystanders shout their concern, one officer says, “He’s talking, so he’s breathing.” But Floyd slowly becomes motionless under the officer’s restraint. The officer does not remove his knee until the man is loaded onto a gurney by paramedics. Several witnesses had gathered on a nearby sidewalk, some recording the scene on their phones. The bystanders become increasingly agitated. One man yells repeatedly. “He’s not responsive right now!” Two witnesses, including one woman who said she was a Minneapolis firefighter, yell at the officers to check the man’s pulse. “Check his pulse right now and tell me what it is!” she said. At one point, an officer says: “Don’t do drugs, guys.” And one man yells, “Don’t do drugs, bro? What is that? What do you think this is?” The Hennepin County medical examiner identified Floyd but said the cause of death was pending. Floyd had worked security for five years at a restaurant called Conga Latin Bistro and rented a home from the restaurant owner, Jovanni Thunstrom. He was “a good friend, person and a good tenant,” the restaurateur told the Star Tribune. “He was family. His co-workers and friends loved him.” Protesters filled the intersection Tuesday evening in the street where Floyd died, chanting and carrying banners that read, “I can’t breathe” and “Jail killer KKKops.” They eventually marched about 2 1/2 miles to a city police precinct, with some protesters damaging windows, a squad car and spraying graffiti on the building. A line of police in riot gear eventually confronted the protesters, firing tear gas and projectiles. Some protesters kicked canisters back toward police. Some protesters stacked shopping carts to make a barricade at a Target store across the street from the station, and though steady rain diminished the crowd, tense skirmishes stretched late into the evening. Ben Crump, a prominent civil rights and personal injury attorney, said he had been hired by Floyd’s family. The death came amid outrage over the death of Ahmaud Arbery, who was fatally shot Feb. 23 in Georgia after a white father and son pursued the 25-year-old black man they had spotted running in their subdivision. More than two months passed before charges were brought. Crump also represents Arbery’s father.

Based on the video, Mayor Jacob Frey said officer Derek Chauvin should be charged in the death of George Floyd. The footage recorded by a bystander shows Chauvin with his knee on Floyd's neck as Floyd gasps for breath on the ground with his face against the pavement. The officer does not move for at least eight minutes, even after Floyd stops speaking and moving. 'I've wrestled with, more than anything else over the last 36 hours, one fundamental question: Why is the man who killed George Floyd not in jail?' said Frey, who is white. He later added: ""I saw no threat. I saw nothing that would signal that this kind of force was necessary.' The day after Floyd died, Chauvin and three other officers were fired "" an act that did not stem the flood of anger that followed the widely seen video shot on Memorial Day outside a convenience store. Protesters marched more than 2 miles Tuesday to the police precinct in that part of the city, with some damaging property and skirmishing with officers in riot gear who fired tear gas. Conflict erupted again Wednesday at the same precinct, with some protesters throwing rocks and bottles at police. News helicopter video appeared to show looting of nearby stores, including a Target, a Cub Foods and an auto parts store, with no evident police intervention. Another demonstration unfolded on the street outside Chauvin's suburban home. An officer told protesters that Chauvin was not there. Red cans of paint were earlier spilled on his driveway, and someone wrote 'murderer' in chalk at the end of his driveway. No one answered when an Associated Press reporter knocked on the door. Many activists, citizens and celebrities called for criminal charges before Frey did. But Floyd's family and the community may have to wait months, if not years, before investigations are complete. Floyd family attorney Benjamin Crump, a prominent civil rights lawyer, called for peaceful protests. 'We cannot sink to the level of our oppressors, and we must not endanger others during this pandemic,' Crump said in a statement. 'We will demand and ultimately force lasting change by shining a light on treatment that is horrific and unacceptable and by winning justice.' Police Chief Medaria Arradondo, who rose to the top job after his predecessor was forced out following the 2017 shooting of an unarmed white woman by a black Minneapolis officer, urged protesters to 'be respectful.' He said he was working to change the department's culture. 'One incident can significantly bring people to doubt that,' he said. The chief defended the department's use of tear gas to break up Tuesday night's protests, saying officers used it only after some people broke into a secure area that gave them access to squad cars and weapons. Gov. Tim Walz and Minnesota's two top law enforcement officials "" Attorney General Keith Ellison and Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington, both black "" promised a thorough, transparent investigation. But Walz and Ellison didn't endorse the mayor's call to immediately charge the officer, saying the legal process needs to play out. 'I understand the emotions are running high, and I think it's important for the mayor to channel the emotion of the people who he represents. But I think it is critical that we adhere very closely to the facts and the law and the normal process,' Ellison said. The Hennepin County Attorney's Office, which would prosecute any state charges, issued a statement saying that Floyd's death had 'outraged us and people across the country' and that the case 'deserves the best we can give.' The FBI was investigating whether officers willfully deprived Floyd of his civil rights. Floyd's death and that of Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia have reopened the divide between minority communities and police that grew to a national uproar following the 2014 killings of Eric Garner and Michael Brown, the 2015 killing of Freddie Gray and others. Speaking to reporters at Cape Canaveral, Florida, President Donald Trump called the death in Minneapolis 'a very, very sad event"" and said his administration was going to 'look at it.' Later, he tweeted that he had asked for the federal investigation be expedited. Democrat Joe Biden said Floyd's death was 'part of an ingrained, systemic cycle of injustice that still exists in this country' and ""cuts at the very heart of our sacred belief that all Americans are equal in rights.' It also 'sends a very clear message to the black community and black lives that are under threat every single day,"" Biden added, saying he was glad the mayor and the police department fired the officers, ""but I don't think that's enough.' A 2017 Pew Research Center study found that police think the public does not understand the risks they face. A more recent study from September showed police were considered more trustworthy than Congress, but only 33% of black adults and half of Hispanics say they believe officers treat racial and ethnic groups equally. Shocking videos of black men dying continue to emerge during the pandemic, which is hitting communities of color harder than white communities. Floyd himself had been laid off from his nightclub security job in the pandemic, a friend told the AP. Police say Floyd matched the description of someone who tried to pay with a counterfeit bill at the convenience store. It was unclear why Floyd was arrested in such a physical way for what would have been a low-level crime. Police in most large cities have backed away from certain arrests to guard against further spread of the virus. The officers in the video were not wearing masks. A Minneapolis Fire Department report shows that paramedics moved Floyd from the scene, and two fire crew members got into the ambulance to help. Medics were doing chest compressions and other lifesaving measures on an 'unresponsive, pulseless male,' the report said. Floyd was pronounced dead at a hospital. An autopsy will be performed to determine if the neck compression led to his death. News accounts show Chauvin was one of six officers who fired their weapons in the 2006 death of Wayne Reyes, who police said pointed a sawed-off shotgun at officers after stabbing two people. Chauvin also shot and wounded a man in 2008 during a struggle after Chauvin and his partner responded to a reported domestic assault. Police did not immediately respond to a request for Chauvin's service record. Chauvin's attorney confirmed the officer's identity on Tuesday. The department identified the other officers Wednesday as Thomas Lane, Tou Thao and J Alexander Kueng. In calling for charges, the mayor contrasted Floyd's death with others involving police that turned on split-second decisions by officers. 'We are not talking about a split-second decision that was made incorrectly,"" Frey said.

1618105087,2020-05-27 08:05:57,Swift firings for Minneapolis officers in death of black man,https://www.newportri.com/ZZ/news/20200527/swift-firings-for-minneapolis-officers-in-death-of-black-man?rssfeed=true,en,True,,662950,Newport Daily News,http://www.newportdailynews.com/ee/newportdailynews/index.php,"MINNEAPOLIS (AP) "" The mayor of Minneapolis called Wednesday for criminal charges against the white police officer seen on video kneeling against the neck of a handcuffed black man who complained that he could not breathe and died in police custody. Based on the video, Mayor Jacob Frey said officer Derek Chauvin should be charged in the death of George Floyd. The footage recorded by a bystander shows Chauvin with his knee on Floyd's neck as Floyd gasps for breath on the ground with his face against the pavement. The officer does not move for at least eight minutes, even after Floyd stops speaking and moving. 'I've wrestled with, more than anything else over the last 36 hours, one fundamental question: Why is the man who killed George Floyd not in jail?' said Frey, who is white. He later added: ""I saw no threat. I saw nothing that would signal that this kind of force was necessary.' The day after Floyd died, Chauvin and three other officers were fired "" an act that did not stem the flood of anger that followed the widely seen video shot on Memorial Day outside a convenience store. Protesters marched more than 2 miles Tuesday to the police precinct in that part of the city, with some damaging property and skirmishing with officers in riot gear who fired tear gas. Conflict erupted again Wednesday at the same precinct, with some protesters throwing rocks and bottles at police. News helicopter video appeared to show looting of nearby stores, including a Target, a Cub Foods and an auto parts store, with no evident police intervention. Another demonstration unfolded on the street outside Chauvin's suburban home. An officer told protesters that Chauvin was not there. Red cans of paint were earlier spilled on his driveway, and someone wrote 'murderer' in chalk at the end of his driveway. No one answered when an Associated Press reporter knocked on the door. Many activists, citizens and celebrities called for criminal charges before Frey did. But Floyd's family and the community may have to wait months, if not years, before investigations are complete. Floyd family attorney Benjamin Crump, a prominent civil rights lawyer, called for peaceful protests. 'We cannot sink to the level of our oppressors, and we must not endanger others during this pandemic,' Crump said in a statement. 'We will demand and ultimately force lasting change by shining a light on treatment that is horrific and unacceptable and by winning justice.' Police Chief Medaria Arradondo, who rose to the top job after his predecessor was forced out following the 2017 shooting of an unarmed white woman by a black Minneapolis officer, urged protesters to 'be respectful.' He said he was working to change the department's culture. 'One incident can significantly bring people to doubt that,' he said. The chief defended the department's use of tear gas to break up Tuesday night's protests, saying officers used it only after some people broke into a secure area that gave them access to squad cars and weapons. Gov. Tim Walz and Minnesota's two top law enforcement officials "" Attorney General Keith Ellison and Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington, both black "" promised a thorough, transparent investigation. But Walz and Ellison didn't endorse the mayor's call to immediately charge the officer, saying the legal process needs to play out. 'I understand the emotions are running high, and I think it's important for the mayor to channel the emotion of the people who he represents. But I think it is critical that we adhere very closely to the facts and the law and the normal process,' Ellison said. The Hennepin County Attorney's Office, which would prosecute any state charges, issued a statement saying that Floyd's death had 'outraged us and people across the country' and that the case 'deserves the best we can give.' The FBI was investigating whether officers willfully deprived Floyd of his civil rights. Floyd's death and that of Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia have reopened the divide between minority communities and police that grew to a national uproar following the 2014 killings of Eric Garner and Michael Brown, the 2015 killing of Freddie Gray and others. Speaking to reporters at Cape Canaveral, Florida, President Donald Trump called the death in Minneapolis 'a very, very sad event"" and said his administration was going to 'look at it.' Later, he tweeted that he had asked for the federal investigation be expedited. Democrat Joe Biden said Floyd's death was 'part of an ingrained, systemic cycle of injustice that still exists in this country' and ""cuts at the very heart of our sacred belief that all Americans are equal in rights.' It also 'sends a very clear message to the black community and black lives that are under threat every single day,"" Biden added, saying he was glad the mayor and the police department fired the officers, ""but I don't think that's enough.' A 2017 Pew Research Center study found that police think the public does not understand the risks they face. A more recent study from September showed police were considered more trustworthy than Congress, but only 33% of black adults and half of Hispanics say they believe officers treat racial and ethnic groups equally. Shocking videos of black men dying continue to emerge during the pandemic, which is hitting communities of color harder than white communities. Floyd himself had been laid off from his nightclub security job in the pandemic, a friend told the AP. Police say Floyd matched the description of someone who tried to pay with a counterfeit bill at the convenience store. It was unclear why Floyd was arrested in such a physical way for what would have been a low-level crime. Police in most large cities have backed away from certain arrests to guard against further spread of the virus. The officers in the video were not wearing masks. A Minneapolis Fire Department report shows that paramedics moved Floyd from the scene, and two fire crew members got into the ambulance to help. Medics were doing chest compressions and other lifesaving measures on an 'unresponsive, pulseless male,' the report said. Floyd was pronounced dead at a hospital. An autopsy will be performed to determine if the neck compression led to his death. News accounts show Chauvin was one of six officers who fired their weapons in the 2006 death of Wayne Reyes, who police said pointed a sawed-off shotgun at officers after stabbing two people. Chauvin also shot and wounded a man in 2008 during a struggle after Chauvin and his partner responded to a reported domestic assault. Police did not immediately respond to a request for Chauvin's service record. Chauvin's attorney confirmed the officer's identity on Tuesday. The department identified the other officers Wednesday as Thomas Lane, Tou Thao and J Alexander Kueng. In calling for charges, the mayor contrasted Floyd's death with others involving police that turned on split-second decisions by officers. 'We are not talking about a split-second decision that was made incorrectly,"" Frey said. ""There's somewhere around 300 seconds in those five minutes "" every one of which that officer could have turned back, every second of which he could have removed his knee from George Floyd's neck.' ___ Long reported from Washington.

Police said they were investigating the death as a homicide and had a suspect in custody, but were still investigating what led to the shooting. Protesters began gathering in the early afternoon near the city's 3rd Precinct station, in the southern part of the city where 46-year-old George Floyd died on Memorial Day after an officer knelt on his neck until he became unresponsive. News helicopter footage showed protesters milling in streets near the city's 3rd Precinct station, with some running in and out of nearby stores. A Target, a Cub Foods, a Dollar Tree and an auto parts store all showed signs of damage and looting. As darkness fell, fire erupted in the auto parts store, and city fire crews rushed to control it. Protesters set other fires in the street. Officers could be seen surrounding the nearby precinct, not attempting to intervene in the looting. Police spokesman John Elder said officers responding to a reported stabbing near the protests found a man lying on the sidewalk with what turned out to be a bullet wound. The man was pronounced dead at a local hospital. Elder said a suspect was in custody but said the facts leading up to the shooting were ""still being sorted out."" It was the second night of violent protest since the death of Floyd, whom police were seeking to arrest outside a Minneapolis grocery store on a report of a counterfeit bill being passed. A bystander's cellphone video showed an officer kneeling on Floyd 's neck for almost eight minutes as he eventually became unresponsive. Mayor Jacob Frey tweeted for calm early Thursday. ""Please, Minneapolis, we cannot let tragedy beget more tragedy,"" he said on Twitter. He also asked for the public's help in keeping the peace. The officer and three others were fired Tuesday, and on Wednesday, Frey called for him to be criminally charged. Protesters also gathered Wednesday evening at the officer's suburban home as well as the Minneapolis home of Mike Freeman, the Hennepin County prosecutor who would make a charging decision in the case. No violence was reported in those protests. As the protests stretched into the evening, Police Chief Medaria Arradondo urged calm. In an interview with KMSP-TV, he noted the internal investigation as well as the FBI's investigation of Floyd's death and said they offer a chance at justice. ""Justice historically has never come to fruition through some of the acts we're seeing tonight, whether it's the looting, the damage to property or other things,"" he said. Elder said officers from St. Paul, Metro Transit and the state patrol were helping police the area. In California, hundreds of people protesting Floyd's death blocked a Los Angeles freeway and shattered windows of California Highway Patrol cruisers on Wednesday.",0.0

(Carlos Gonzalez/Star Tribune via AP) MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Violent protests over the death of a black man in police custody rocked a Minneapolis neighborhood for a second straight night as angry crowds looted stores, set fires and left a path of damage that stretched for miles. The mayor asked the governor to activate the National Guard. The protests that began late Wednesday and stretched into Thursday morning were the most destructive yet since the death of George Floyd, who was seen on video gasping for breath during an arrest in which an officer kneeled on his neck for almost eight minutes. In the footage, George pleads that he cannot breathe and slowly stops talking and moving. Mayor Jacob Frey sought calm. “Please, Minneapolis, we cannot let tragedy beget more tragedy,” he said on Twitter. Protests also spread to other U.S. cities. In California, hundreds of people protesting Floyd’s death blocked a Los Angeles freeway and shattered windows of California Highway Patrol cruisers. Memphis police blocked a main thoroughfare after a racially mixed group of protesters gathered outside a police precinct. The situation intensified later in the night, with police donning riot gear and protesters standing shoulder-to-shoulder in front of officers stationed behind a barricade. Minneapolis police said the violence contrasted sharply with a mostly peaceful demonstration Tuesday afternoon at the street corner where Floyd died. “They were chanting for things to remain peaceful,” police spokesman John Elder said. “Tonight didn’t have the same feel. And that’s sad.” Pockets of looting continued Thursday. A liquor store employee displayed a gun as he stood among the debris of broken bottles and beer cans inside the business. Amid the violence, a man was found fatally shot Wednesday night near a pawn shop, possibly by the owner, authorities said. Fire crews responded to about 30 intentionally set blazes during the protests, including at least 16 structure fires, and multiple fire trucks were damaged by rocks and other projectiles, the fire department said. No one was hurt by the blazes. Firefighters were still spraying water onto hot buildings Thursday morning, and some buildings still smoldered, sending a bitter smell into the smoke-filled air. Windows were smashed out of several businesses in a strip mall, including a department store, a charter school and other businesses, and the destruction was visible for blocks. A Wendy’s restaurant was damaged beyond recognition. Inside some of the stores, shelves were toppled and debris strewn about. Video taken inside a damaged Target that had been looted showed empty clothing racks. Obscenities were spray-painted on the outside of the store. Streets and parking lots were also covered in debris, and many businesses had been spray-painted. There was no sign of a police presence, except around the precinct building, where officers were in riot gear. One man standing outside the building was using a bullhorn to shout. “I can’t breathe, I can’t breathe. Mama, I can’t breathe,” repeating some of Floyd’s pleas for relief. Across from the precinct, someone had spray-painted the sidewalk in red: “Where’s humanity?” Protesters began gathering Wednesday afternoon near the city’s 3rd Precinct station, in the southern part of the city, where the 46-year-old Floyd died on Memorial Day as police arrested him outside a convenience store on a report of a counterfeit bill being passed. Demonstrators also skirmished with officers, who fired rubber bullets and tear gas in a repeat of Tuesday night’s confrontation. The U.S. Attorney’s Office and the FBI in Minneapolis said Thursday they were conducting “a robust criminal investigation” into Floyd’s death and making the case a priority.

Memphis: George Floyd's death was 'nail in the unfortunate coffin for America' A silent demonstration to protest the death of Floyd, as well as Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery, turned into verbal confrontations with Memphis police and counter-protesters. The rally began with about 40 people holding signs reading “Black Lives Matter,” “Stop killing black people” and “Silence is violence.” Protesters were largely silent, with occasional chants of “no justice, no peace” and the names of black men and women who had been killed by police officers. Passing drivers — and one ambulance — honked in support and waved or gave thumbs-up. Within an hour, however, the protesters were met by two counter-protesters, who identified themselves as members of the Facebook group Confederate 901. Theryn C. Bond, a prominent local activist and former Memphis City Council candidate, confronted the counter-protesters, who occasionally jeered at the crowd to ""go out for a jog"" — a reference to Aubrey's slaying.

The death of George Floyd continued to ripple across the U.S. on Wednesday night as the calls became louder for the arrest of the white police officer who knelt on his neck for several minutes in a horrifying video that spread across social media this week. Meanwhile on Thursday, Ben Crump, attorney for Floyd's family, warned any instigators of violence in the Minneapolis protests: ""We don't need that. We need people focused on getting justice,"" he said. He is calling for an independent autopsy, saying he doesn't trust the city of Minneapolis. ""They offered him no humanity while keeping his knee on his neck. Members of the public were the only ones trying to de-escalate the situation. Not the police,"" Crump told CNN on Thursday. ""Keeping the knee on the neck for over 8 minutes – that is unconscionable."" While hundreds of protesters took to the streets, police chiefs from coast to coast expressed their outrage with Floyd's death. ""Do not defend the undefendable, attempt to justify the unjustifiable or excuse the inexcusable,"" Miami Police Chief Jorge Colina said on Twitter. ""George Floyd should be alive today."" ""The lack of compassion, use of excessive force, or going beyond the scope of the law, doesn't just tarnish our badge – it tears at the very fabric of race relations in this country,"" Los Angeles Police Chief Michel Moore said in a statement posted to Twitter. Minneapolis: Police, protesters clash; looters raid Target, Dollar Tree, other stores Protests in Minneapolis devolved into chaos on Wednesday night. Reports of fires came from around the city and videos of looters inside of stores quickly spread on social media. Several people shared video of people taking products from a local Target. A Cub Foods, a Dollar Tree and an AutoZone store also showed signs of damage and looting, and windows of businesses in nearby strip malls were reported to be smashed out. At least one person was killed. Police spokesman John Elder told USA TODAY that the department was investigating a homicide near the area where a reporter from the Star Tribune newspaper tweeted that a looter had been shot and killed by a pawn shop owner. One person was in custody early Thursday, the Star Tribune reported, but police wouldn't confirm if the victim was a looter. “The facts of what led up to the shooting are still being sorted out. We are truly in the infancy of this investigation,” Elder said. As the protests stretched into the evening, Police Chief Medaria Arradondo urged calm. In an interview with KMSP-TV, he noted the internal investigation as well as the FBI’s investigation of Floyd’s death and said they offer a chance at justice. “Justice historically has never come to fruition through some of the acts we’re seeing tonight, whether it’s the looting, the damage to property or other things,” he said. Memphis: George Floyd's death was 'nail in the unfortunate coffin for America' A silent demonstration to protest the death of Floyd, as well as Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery, turned into verbal confrontations with Memphis police and counter-protesters. The rally began with about 40 people holding signs reading “Black Lives Matter,” “Stop killing black people” and “Silence is violence.” Protesters were largely silent, with occasional chants of “no justice, no peace” and the names of black men and women who had been killed by police officers. Passing drivers — and one ambulance — honked in support and waved or gave thumbs-up. Within an hour, however, the protesters were met by two counter-protesters, who identified themselves as members of the Facebook group Confederate 901. Theryn C. Bond, a prominent local activist and former Memphis City Council candidate, confronted the counter-protesters, who occasionally jeered at the crowd to ""go out for a jog"" — a reference to Aubrey's slaying. ""I was so impressed to see so many white allies,"" Bond said. ""Because sometimes we think, 'Everybody doesn't get it.' And I think with the recent murder of George Floyd by police... I think this was the proverbial nail in the unfortunate coffin for America to really understand what we mean when we say, 'Black Lives Matter.'"" Floyd's death this week is the latest in a string of violence against black people. Taylor was shot and killed in her Kentucky home by officers executing a ""no-knock"" search warrant, while Arbery was shot and killed while jogging after being pursued by two white men who later said they thought he was a burglary suspect.

Los Angeles: Protesters block 101 freeway, smash windows of California Highway Patrol cruisers Hundreds of people protesting Floyd's death while in police custody blocked a Los Angeles freeway and shattered windows of California Highway Patrol cruisers in a rally organized by Black Lives Matter. Demonstrators gathered in the late afternoon on downtown streets and, eventually, dozens of them moved onto U.S. 101 despite police efforts to keep them from walking into the lanes. When a CHP patrol car arrived, demonstrators surrounded it. The car's window was smashed and it jerked forward and moved away with several protesters who had jumped onto the hood. Television news footage showed one man finally hopping or jumping from the side of the moving car and then flopping onto the ground. A second CHP car arrived and was attacked, with one demonstrator hurling what appeared to be a wooden skateboard through the back window before it moved off. At its rally's peak, hundreds of people gathered outside the Los Angeles County Hall of Justice. The demonstration was mostly peaceful and no arrests were immediately made, Los Angeles police Officer Mike Lopez said. Contributing: Corinne S. Kennedy, Micaela A.

But it was a very different tone for President Donald Trump, who has often been silent in the face of white-on-black violence and has a long history of defending police. 'I feel very, very badly,"" Trump said Thursday of George Floyd's death while handcuffed and in the custody of Minneapolis police. ""That's a very shocking sight.' Once more likely to hew to the 'blue lives matter' mantra, Trump and his allies are questioning an officer's conduct and calling for justice for Floyd. But some activists doubt that Trump has suddenly evolved on the issue of police brutality and instead see election-year political calculations. 'This is the first race-tinged case that I've ever heard him address' as president, said the Rev. Al Sharpton, a civil rights activist and Trump critic who has known the president for decades. 'So therefore he cannot be upset when people feel that it's empty words because it is so out of character.' White House spokesman Judd Deere said Trump was taking the death seriously. 'This has nothing to do with politics and is only about making sure justice is done, and anyone who suggests otherwise is only seeking to sow division and ignore the President's unwavering support for the African-American community,' Deere said, citing Trump's support for criminal justice reform legislation, Opportunity Zones and historically black colleges and universities. Trump has been silent on a number of high-profile police-involved killings, including that of Stephon Clark, a black man shot by Sacramento police in 2018. 'This is something that is a local matter and that's something that we feel should be left up to the local authorities,' then-White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said at the time. He has never addressed the 2014 death of Eric Garner, who was placed in a chokehold by police trying to arrest him for selling loose cigarettes. Video of the encounter was viewed millions of times online and Garner's dying words, 'I can't breathe,' became a rallying cry for the Black Lives Matter movement. Trump has, however, invoked those words on several occasions to mock political rivals, even bringing his hands to his neck for dramatic effect. Trump has a long history of injecting himself into racially sensitive cases. In 1989, he took out full-page newspaper ads calling for the death penalty for the Central Park Five, five young men of color who were wrongly convicted of a brutal assault on a jogger. Trump has never apologized, telling reporters last year: 'You have people on both sides of that.' Trump also spent years railing against NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick for kneeling during the national anthem to protest racial injustice and police brutality. And he has even appeared to advocate for the rougher treatment of people in police custody, speaking dismissively of the police practice of shielding the heads of handcuffed suspects as they are being placed in patrol cars. But Trump's tone has changed in recent weeks as he has repeatedly expressed dismay at footage of the killing of Ahmaud Arbery, the 25-year-old black man fatally shot in February in Georgia while jogging. 'You know, my heart goes out to the parents and the family and the friends,"" he told reporters this month. ""It's a heartbreaking thing.' The president has notably left open the possibility of some other explanation, saying: 'it could be something that we didn't see on tape."" Trump and his allies have been even clearer on the death of Floyd, who can be heard and seen on tape pleading that he couldn't breathe before he slowly stops talking and moving. Trump 'was very upset when he saw that video,"" White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said Thursday. 'He wants justice to be served.' Trump's conservative allies also rallied to the cause. Fox News host Sean Hannity said he is ""a big supporter of law enforcement,"" but expressed outrage Wednesday night, telling his audience: 'The lack of training here is breathtaking.' 'It defies common sense. It defies training. It defies arrest policies and procedures. There was no resistance,' echoed Bernie Kerik, the former New York police commissioner pardoned by Trump. 'We got to get to the very bottom of how this poor individual was treated, and the death of him on the video itself is shocking from what I saw,' said Republican House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. Even conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh, who once called Black Lives Matter a 'terrorist group,' said Thursday that Floyd's death was totally 'unjustified' and he was 'so mad.' The outpouring comes as the Trump campaign has sought to chip into the advantage Democrats have with black voters. The campaign hopes either to win enough black support to keep pivotal states such as Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin in play or minimize enthusiasm for Democratic rival Joe Biden. There could be a small window after Biden last week told a prominent black radio host that African Americans who back Trump 'ain't black,' a gaffe he later said he regretted. Trump and his allies have seized on that and other Biden statements, even though Biden, who served as vice president under the nation's first black president, remains deeply popular among black voters, who helped him secure the Democratic nomination. Indeed, a recent Fox News poll found that just 14% of African Americans who are registered to vote have a favorable opinion of Trump, versus 75% who have a favorable view of Biden.

But some civil rights advocates say their denunciations are empty words without meaningful reform behind them. Authorities say George Floyd was detained Monday because he matched the description of someone who tried to pay with a counterfeit bill at a convenience store, and the 46-year-old resisted arrest. A bystander's disturbing video shows Officer Derek Chauvin, who is white, kneeling on Floyd's neck, even as Floyd begs for air and slowly stops talking and moving. 'There is no need to see more video,' Chattanooga, Tennessee, Police Chief David Roddy tweeted Wednesday. 'There no need to wait to see how 'it plays out'. There is no need to put a knee on someone's neck for NINE minutes. There IS a need to DO something. If you wear a badge and you don't have an issue with this ... turn it in.' The reaction from some law enforcement stands in stark contrast to their muted response or support for police after other in-custody fatalities. Sheriffs and police chiefs have strongly criticized the Minneapolis officer on social media and praised the city's police chief for his quick dismissal of four officers at the scene. Some even called for them to be criminally charged. 'I am deeply disturbed by the video of Mr. Floyd being murdered in the street with other officers there letting it go on,' Polk County, Georgia, Sheriff Johnny Moats wrote on Facebook. 'I can assure everyone, me or any of my deputies will never treat anyone like that as long as I'm Sheriff. This kind of brutality is terrible and it needs to stop. All Officers involved need to be arrested and charged immediately. Praying for the family.' Typically, police call for patience and calm in the wake of a use of force. They are reluctant to weigh in on episodes involving another agency, often citing ongoing investigations or due process. 'Not going hide behind 'not being there,'"" tweeted San Jose Police, California, Chief Eddie Garcia. ""I'd be one of the first to condemn anyone had I seen similar happen to one of my brother/ sister officers. What I saw happen to George Floyd disturbed me and is not consistent with the goal of our mission. The act of one, impacts us all.' But Gloria Browne-Marshall, a civil rights attorney and professor at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice, said she wouldn't be a 'cheerleader' for a 'handful' of chiefs who harshly decried the officers' behavior. 'Any minute progress is seen as miraculous because so little has been done for so long,' she said. 'It's nothing close to progress or what outrage would be taking place if it was a white man as the victim of this assault.' Melina Abdullah, co-founder of Black Lives Matter in Los Angeles, said she wasn't 'particularly moved' by the relatively few police who voiced outrage. Abdullah said the three other officers who witnessed Chauvin's actions and did not intervene contributed to a long-standing system of police racism and oppression against people of color. 'We've got to remember that it was not just Officer Chauvin who was sitting on George Floyd's neck,' she said. Abdullah and hundreds of others protested what she called Floyd's lynching on Wednesday night. Some blocked lanes of a freeway and shattered windows of California Highway Patrol cruisers. Minneapolis is bracing for more violence after days of civil unrest, with burned buildings, looted stores and angry graffiti demanding justice. The governor on Thursday called in the National Guard. On Thursday night, protesters torched a Minneapolis police station that the department was forced to abandon. The heads of the Los Angeles and Chicago departments "" both of which have been rocked before by police brutality scandals "" addressed Floyd's death and its potential effect on race relations between law enforcement and communities of color. Even the New York Police Department weighed in. Eric Garner died in the city in 2014 after he was placed in a chokehold by police and uttered the same words Floyd did: 'I can't breathe.' It took city officials five years to fire the officer, and no criminal or federal charges were brought. ""What we saw in Minnesota was deeply disturbing. It was wrong,"" NYPD Commissioner Dermot Shea wrote Thursday. 'We must take a stand and address it. We must come together, condemn these actions and reinforce who we are as members of the NYPD. This is not acceptable ANYWHERE.' Before he was commissioner, Shea spearheaded the NYPD's shift to community policing that moved away from a more confrontational style favored by other commissioners after Garner's death. Harris County, Texas, Sheriff Ed Gonzalez, who also spoke out online, told The Associated Press that law enforcement agencies keep promising reforms in the wake of fatalities, but they are ""not delivering it on a consistent basis.' 'When bad things happen in our profession, we need to be able to call it like it is,' he said. 'We keep thinking that the last one will be the last one, and then another one surfaces.'",0.0

A police spokesman confirmed late Thursday that staff had evacuated the 3rd precinct station, the focus of many of the protests, 'in the interest of the safety of our personnel"" shortly after 10 p.m. Livestream video showed the protesters entering the building, where fire alarms blared and sprinklers ran as blazes were set. Protesters could be seen setting fire to a Minneapolis Police Department jacket and cheering. Protests first erupted Tuesday, a day after Floyd's death in a confrontation with police captured on widely seen citizen video. On the video, Floyd can be seen pleading that he can't breathe as Officer Derek Chauvin, who is white, kneels on his neck. As minutes pass, Floyd slowly stops talking and moving. The 3rd Precinct covers the portion of south Minneapolis where Floyd died. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz earlier Thursday activated the National Guard at the Minneapolis mayor's request, but it wasn't immediately clear when and where the Guard was being deployed, and none could be seen during protests in Minneapolis or St. Paul. The Guard tweeted minutes after the precinct burned that it had activated more than 500 soldiers across the metro area. The Guard tweeted that a 'key objective' was to make sure fire departments could respond to calls, and said in a follow-up tweet it was 'here with the Minneapolis Fire Department' to assist. But no move was made to put out the 3rd Precinct fire. A department spokesman didn't immediately respond to a phone call. Fire Chief John Fruetel told CNN that the department couldn't get to the scene for safety reasons. Earlier Thursday, dozens of businesses across the Twin Cities boarded up their windows and doors in an effort to prevent looting, with Minneapolis-based Target announcing it was temporarily closing two dozen area stores. Minneapolis shut down nearly its entire light-rail system and all bus service through Sunday out of safety concerns. In St. Paul, clouds of smoke hung in the air as police armed with batons and wearing gas masks and body armor kept a watchful eye on protesters along one of the city's main commercial corridors, where firefighters also sprayed water onto a series of small fires. At one point, officers stood in line in front of a Target, trying to keep out looters, who were also smashing windows of other businesses. Hundreds of demonstrators returned Thursday to the Minneapolis neighborhood at the center of the violence, where the nighttime scene veered between an angry protest and a street party. At one point, a band playing in a parking lot across from the 3rd Precinct broke into a punk version of Bob Marley's 'Redemption Song."" Nearby, demonstrators carried clothing mannequins from a looted Target and threw them onto a burning car. Later, a building fire erupted nearby. But elsewhere in Minneapolis, thousands of peaceful demonstrators marched through the streets calling for justice. Floyd's death has deeply shaken Minneapolis and sparked protests in cities across the U.S. Local leaders have repeatedly urged demonstrators to avoid violence. 'Please stay home. Please do not come here to protest. Please keep the focus on George Floyd, on advancing our movement and on preventing this from ever happening again,' tweeted St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter, who is black. Erika Atson, 20, was among thousands of people who gathered outside government offices in downtown Minneapolis, where organizers had called a peaceful protest. Many protesters wore masks because of the coronavirus pandemic, but there were few attempts at social distancing. Atson, who is black, described seeing her 14- and 11-year-old brothers tackled by Minneapolis police years ago because officers mistakenly presumed the boys had guns. She said she had been at 'every single protest' since Floyd's death and worried about raising children who could be vulnerable in police encounters. 'We don't want to be here fighting against anyone. We don't want anyone to be hurt. We don't want to cause any damages,' she said. 'We just want the police officer to be held accountable.' Hennepin County Sheriff David Hutchinson said the rally had been peaceful and there had been no arrests by late evening. After calling in the Guard, Walz urged widespread changes in the wake of Floyd's death. ""It is time to rebuild. Rebuild the city, rebuild our justice system and rebuild the relationship between law enforcement and those they're charged to protect,' Walz said. Much of the Minneapolis violence occurred in the Longfellow neighborhood, where protesters converged on the precinct station of the police who arrested Floyd. In a strip mall across the street from the 3rd Precinct station, the windows in nearly every business had been smashed, from the large Target department store at one end to the Planet Fitness gym at the other. Only the 24-hour laundromat appeared to have escaped unscathed. 'WHY US?' demanded a large expanse of red graffiti scrawled on the wall of the Target. A Wendy's restaurant across the street was charred almost beyond recognition. Among the casualties of the overnight fires: a six-story building under construction that was to provide nearly 200 apartments of affordable housing. 'We're burning our own neighborhood,' said a distraught Deona Brown, a 24-year-old woman standing with a friend outside the precinct station, where a small group of protesters were shouting at a dozen or so stone-faced police officers in riot gear. 'This is where we live, where we shop, and they destroyed it.' No officers could be seen beyond the station. 'What that cop did was wrong, but I'm scared now,' Brown said. Others in the crowd saw something different in the wreckage. Protesters destroyed property ""because the system is broken,' said a young man who identified himself only by his nickname, Cash, and who said he had been in the streets during the violence. He dismissed the idea that the destruction would hurt residents of the largely black neighborhood. 'They're making money off of us,' he said angrily of the owners of the destroyed stores. He laughed when asked if he had joined in the looting or violence. 'I didn't break anything.' The protests that began Wednesday night and extended into Thursday were more violent than Tuesday's, which included skirmishes between offices and protesters but no widespread property damage. Mayor Jacob Frey appealed for calm but the city's response to the protests was quickly questioned as things started spiraling into violence. 'If the strategy was to keep residents safe "" it failed,' City Council Member Jeremiah Ellison, who is black, tweeted. 'Prevent property damage "" it failed."" On Thursday, he urged police to leave the scene of the overnight violence, saying their presence brings people into the streets. But Eric Kowalczyk, a police captain in Baltimore during the Freddie Gray riots in 2015, generally supported the Minneapolis police strategy to avoid confrontations with protesters when possible, saying heavy-handed police responses are only met with more violence. 'Nobody wants to see their city on fire, but at the same time, you don't want to see citizens injured by the very police department they are protesting,' he said. Protests have also spread to other U.S. cities. In New York City, protesters defied New York's coronavirus prohibition on public gatherings Thursday, clashing with police, while demonstrators blocked traffic in downtown Denver. A day earlier, demonstrators had taken to the streets in Los Angeles and Memphis. Amid the violence in Minneapolis, a man was found fatally shot Wednesday night near a pawn shop, possibly by the owner, authorities said. Fire crews responded to about 30 intentionally set blazes, and multiple fire trucks were damaged by rocks and other projectiles, the fire department said. No one was hurt by the blazes. The city on Thursday released a transcript of the 911 call that brought police to the grocery store where Floyd was arrested. The caller described someone paying with a counterfeit bill, with workers rushing outside to find the man sitting on a van. The caller described the man as 'awfully drunk and he's not in control of himself.' Asked by the 911 operator whether the man was 'under the influence of something,' the caller said: 'Something like that, yes. He is not acting right.' Police said Floyd matched the caller's description of the suspect. The U.S. Attorney's Office and the FBI in Minneapolis said Thursday they were conducting 'a robust criminal investigation' into the death. President Donald Trump has said he had asked an investigation to be expedited. The FBI is also investigating whether Floyd's civil rights were violated. Chauvin, the officer who kneeled on Floyd's neck, was fired Tuesday with three other officers involved in the arrest. The next day, the mayor called for Chauvin to be criminally charged. He also appealed for the activation of the National Guard. ___ Associated Press writers Steve Karnowski, Jeff Baenen and Doug Glass in Minneapolis, and Gretchen Ehlke in Milwaukee contributed to this report.",0.0

Hundreds of demonstrators stood in the downtown streets and chanted as darkness fell outside the Colorado State Capitol, where protesters spray-painted graffiti and broke car windows. In other areas of downtown Denver, police in riot gear fired gas canisters, used rubber bullets and walked in a phalanx through the streets to drive protesters away. The protest briefly spilled over onto Interstate 25, blocking all lanes of traffic until police used tear gas to disperse the crowd. The protests continued into the night, despite Denver Mayor Michael Hancock pleading for calm. 'I certainly understand everyone's frustration and sense of pain and disgust following the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis,' he said in a video posted on Twitter. 'But I want to plead to everyone. Let's demonstrate, but let's demonstrate peacefully. Leave the weapons home.' Earlier in the protest, gunfire outside the state Capitol sent people running for cover. Gary Cutler, a spokesman for the Colorado State Patrol, said the shots were fired in a park across the street. Most of the protesters already had left the area and were marching downtown. Cutler said the Capitol building was locked down, and everyone inside was safe. No injuries have been reported from the shots. State Rep. Leslie Herod, who was protesting at the Capitol, tweeted, 'We just got shot at."" She later said, ""We will not be deterred by this unspeakable act of violence.' Police spokesman Kurt Barnes said it's unclear if the protesters were being targeted, and no one has been arrested. About six or seven shots were fired, he said. Several hundred protesters had gathered to call for justice following the death of Floyd, who died in police custody in Minneapolis on Monday after an officer knelt on his neck for almost eight minutes. In footage recorded by a bystander, Floyd pleaded that he couldn't breathe. Some among the Denver protesters carried signs reading 'Black Lives Matter' and chanted, 'Hey, hey. Ho, ho. Racist police got to go.' Aerial footage showed several protesters smashing the windows out of at least two vehicles parked outside the Capitol, and others spray-painted graffiti on the Capitol steps. A cellphone video shot by protester Anabel Escobar, 29, showed a man on the hood of an SUV making its way through the crowd in front of the Capitol. The video showed the driver speeding up and then apparently trying to run the man over after he fell off the hood. The vehicle sped away as other protesters chased it. It was unclear if the man on the hood was injured. Gov. Jared Polis said Thursday night he was 'absolutely shocked' by the video. 'Coloradans are better than this,' he said. 'I share the immense anguish we all feel about the unjust murder of George Floyd. But let me be clear, senseless violence will never be healed by more violence.' As the protest started, The Denver Police Department tweeted a message from Chief Paul Pazen sending condolences to Floyd's family and saying the city's officers do not use the tactics employed by the Minneapolis officers. He called that type of force 'inexcusable.' Four Minneapolis police officers have been fired, and the mayor has called for the officer who knelt on Floyd's neck to be criminally charged.

'I certainly understand everyone's frustration and sense of pain and disgust following the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis,' he said in a video posted on Twitter. 'But I want to plead to everyone. Let's demonstrate, but let's demonstrate peacefully. Leave the weapons home.' Earlier in the protest, gunfire outside the state Capitol sent people running for cover. Gary Cutler, a spokesman for the Colorado State Patrol, said the shots were fired in a park across the street. Most of the protesters already had left the area and were marching downtown. Cutler said the Capitol building was locked down, and everyone inside was safe. No injuries have been reported from the shots. State Rep. Leslie Herod, who was protesting at the Capitol, tweeted, 'We just got shot at."" She later said, ""We will not be deterred by this unspeakable act of violence.' Police spokesman Kurt Barnes said it's unclear if the protesters were being targeted, and no one has been arrested. About six or seven shots were fired, he said. Several hundred protesters had gathered to call for justice following the death of Floyd, who died in police custody in Minneapolis on Monday after an officer knelt on his neck for almost eight minutes. In footage recorded by a bystander, Floyd pleaded that he couldn't breathe. Some among the Denver protesters carried signs reading 'Black Lives Matter' and chanted, 'Hey, hey. Ho, ho. Racist police got to go.' Aerial footage showed several protesters smashing the windows out of at least two vehicles parked outside the Capitol, and others spray-painted graffiti on the Capitol steps. A cellphone video shot by protester Anabel Escobar, 29, showed a man on the hood of an SUV making its way through the crowd in front of the Capitol. The video showed the driver speeding up and then apparently trying to run the man over after he fell off the hood. The vehicle sped away as other protesters chased it. It was unclear if the man on the hood was injured. Gov. Jared Polis said Thursday night he was 'absolutely shocked' by the video. 'Coloradans are better than this,' he said. 'I share the immense anguish we all feel about the unjust murder of George Floyd. But let me be clear, senseless violence will never be healed by more violence.' As the protest started, The Denver Police Department tweeted a message from Chief Paul Pazen sending condolences to Floyd's family and saying the city's officers do not use the tactics employed by the Minneapolis officers. He called that type of force 'inexcusable.' Four Minneapolis police officers have been fired, and the mayor has called for the officer who knelt on Floyd's neck to be criminally charged. The death has led to violent protests in Minneapolis and demonstrations in other cities, including Los Angeles.",0.0

Brutality. Reprehensible. Indefensible. Police nationwide, in unequivocal and unprecedented language, have condemned the actions of Minneapolis police in the custody death of a handcuffed black man who cried for help as an officer knelt on his neck, pinning him to the pavement for at least eight minutes. But some civil rights advocates say their denunciations are empty words without meaningful reform behind them. Authorities say George Floyd was detained Monday because he matched the description of someone who tried to pay with a counterfeit bill at a convenience store, and the 46-year-old resisted arrest. A bystander's disturbing video shows Officer Derek Chauvin, who is white, kneeling on Floyd's neck, even as Floyd begs for air and slowly stops talking and moving. 'There is no need to see more video,' Chattanooga, Tennessee, Police Chief David Roddy tweeted Wednesday. 'There no need to wait to see how 'it plays out'. There is no need to put a knee on someone's neck for NINE minutes. There IS a need to DO something. If you wear a badge and you don't have an issue with this ... turn it in.' The reaction from some law enforcement stands in stark contrast to their muted response or support for police after other in-custody fatalities. Sheriffs and police chiefs have strongly criticized the Minneapolis officer on social media and praised the city's police chief for his quick dismissal of four officers at the scene. Some even called for them to be criminally charged. 'I am deeply disturbed by the video of Mr. Floyd being murdered in the street with other officers there letting it go on,' Polk County, Georgia, Sheriff Johnny Moats wrote on Facebook. 'I can assure everyone, me or any of my deputies will never treat anyone like that as long as I'm Sheriff. This kind of brutality is terrible and it needs to stop. All Officers involved need to be arrested and charged immediately. Praying for the family.' Typically, police call for patience and calm in the wake of a use of force. They are reluctant to weigh in on episodes involving another agency, often citing ongoing investigations or due process. 'Not going hide behind 'not being there,'"" tweeted San Jose Police, California, Chief Eddie Garcia. ""I'd be one of the first to condemn anyone had I seen similar happen to one of my brother/ sister officers. What I saw happen to George Floyd disturbed me and is not consistent with the goal of our mission. The act of one, impacts us all.' But Gloria Browne-Marshall, a civil rights attorney and professor at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice, said she wouldn't be a 'cheerleader' for a 'handful' of chiefs who harshly decried the officers' behavior. 'Any minute progress is seen as miraculous because so little has been done for so long,' she said. 'It's nothing close to progress or what outrage would be taking place if it was a white man as the victim of this assault.' Melina Abdullah, co-founder of Black Lives Matter in Los Angeles, said she wasn't 'particularly moved' by the relatively few police who voiced outrage. Abdullah said the three other officers who witnessed Chauvin's actions and did not intervene contributed to a long-standing system of police racism and oppression against people of color. 'We've got to remember that it was not just Officer Chauvin who was sitting on George Floyd's neck,' she said. Abdullah and hundreds of others protested what she called Floyd's lynching on Wednesday night. Some blocked lanes of a freeway and shattered windows of California Highway Patrol cruisers. Minneapolis is bracing for more violence after days of civil unrest, with burned buildings, looted stores and angry graffiti demanding justice. The governor on Thursday called in the National Guard. On Thursday night, protesters torched a Minneapolis police station that the department was forced to abandon. The heads of the Los Angeles and Chicago departments "" both of which have been rocked before by police brutality scandals "" addressed Floyd's death and its potential effect on race relations between law enforcement and communities of color. Even the New York Police Department weighed in. Eric Garner died in the city in 2014 after he was placed in a chokehold by police and uttered the same words Floyd did: 'I can't breathe.' It took city officials five years to fire the officer, and no criminal or federal charges were brought. ""What we saw in Minnesota was deeply disturbing. It was wrong,"" NYPD Commissioner Dermot Shea wrote Thursday. 'We must take a stand and address it. We must come together, condemn these actions and reinforce who we are as members of the NYPD. This is not acceptable ANYWHERE.' Before he was commissioner, Shea spearheaded the NYPD's shift to community policing that moved away from a more confrontational style favored by other commissioners after Garner's death. Harris County, Texas, Sheriff Ed Gonzalez, who also spoke out online, told The Associated Press that law enforcement agencies keep promising reforms in the wake of fatalities, but they are ""not delivering it on a consistent basis.'

The crowd of around 400 people entered into a standoff with Columbus police Thursday night, blocking the intersection of key streets in the Ohio capital for hours, the Columbus Dispatch reported. The demonstration began as a peaceful protest, but news outlets reported protesters began throwing objects like water bottles at officers, who responded by using tear gas on the crowd. A scuffle between a protester and an officer broke out around 9:45 p.m., WCMH-TV reported. Some protesters attempted to breach the Ohio Statehouse later Thursday, the TV station reported, sharing photographs of what appeared to be smashed windows at the statehouse. Calls and emails to Columbus police and the Ohio State Highway Patrol, which covers Capitol security, from The Associated Press weren't returned overnight. 'I understand why some residents are angry and taking to the streets. I have said many times that racism exists across the country, state and right here in Columbus. We are committed to addressing racism wherever we see it,' Mayor Andrew Ginther tweeted before 9 p.m. 'I respect peaceful protests and ask residents to remain peaceful in their actions tonight and every night.' Earlier Thursday, video showed the crowd marching down Broad Street and blocking High Street, two downtown arteries near the statehouse. As they marched, protesters engaged in a call-and-response chant: 'Say his name,"" followed by 'George Floyd.' Demonstrators also chanted, 'Black lives matter' and 'I can't breathe.' The Dispatch reported that protesters dispersed by pepper spray broke windows along South High Street and broke into the DGX store, a subsidiary of Dollar General, on the street. Photographs from the Dispatch showed a smashed storefront at the Einstein Bros. Bagels shop across the street from the statehouse.

A police spokesman confirmed late Thursday that staff had evacuated the 3rd Precinct station, the focus of many of the protests, 'in the interest of the safety of our personnel"" shortly after 10 p.m. Livestream video showed the protesters entering the building, where fire alarms blared and sprinklers ran as blazes were set. Protesters could be seen setting fire to a Minneapolis Police Department jacket. Late Thursday, President Donald Trump blasted the 'total lack of leadership' in Minneapolis. 'Just spoke to Governor Tim Walz and told him that the Military is with him all the way. Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts,' he said on Twitter. A visibly tired and frustrated Frey made his first public appearance of the night at City Hall near 2 a.m. and took responsibility for evacuating the precinct, saying it had become too dangerous for officers there. As Frey continued, a reporter cut across loudly with a question: 'What's the plan here?' 'With regard to?' Frey responded. Then he added: 'There is a lot of pain and anger right now in our city. I understand that ... What we have seen over the past several hours and past couple of nights here in terms of looting is unacceptable.' He defended the city's lack of engagement with looters "" only a handful of arrests across the first two nights of violence "" and said, 'We are doing absolutely everything that we can to keep the peace.' He said Guard members were being stationed in locations to help stem looting, including banks, grocery stores and pharmacies. Protests first erupted Tuesday, a day after Floyd's death in a confrontation with police captured on widely seen citizen video. On the video, Floyd can be seen pleading as Officer Derek Chauvin presses his knee against him. As minutes pass, Floyd slowly stops talking and moving. The 3rd Precinct covers the portion of south Minneapolis where Floyd was arrested. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz earlier Thursday activated the National Guard at the Minneapolis mayor's request, but it wasn't immediately clear when and where the Guard was being deployed, and none could be seen during protests in Minneapolis or St. Paul. The Guard tweeted minutes after the precinct burned that it had activated more than 500 soldiers across the metro area. The Guard said a 'key objective' was to make sure fire departments could respond to calls, and said in a follow-up tweet it was 'here with the Minneapolis Fire Department' to assist. But no move was made to put out the 3rd Precinct fire. Assistant Fire Chief Bryan Tyner said fire crews could not safely respond to fires at the precinct station and some surrounding buildings. Earlier Thursday, dozens of businesses across the Twin Cities boarded up their windows and doors in an effort to prevent looting, with Minneapolis-based Target announcing it was temporarily closing two dozen area stores. Minneapolis shut down nearly its entire light-rail system and all bus service through Sunday out of safety concerns. In St. Paul, clouds of smoke hung in the air as police armed with batons and wearing gas masks and body armor kept a watchful eye on protesters along one of the city's main commercial corridors, where firefighters also sprayed water onto a series of small fires. At one point, officers stood in line in front of a Target, trying to keep out looters, who were also smashing windows of other businesses. Hundreds of demonstrators returned Thursday to the Minneapolis neighborhood at the center of the violence, where the nighttime scene veered between an angry protest and a street party. At one point, a band playing in a parking lot across from the 3rd Precinct broke into a punk version of Bob Marley's 'Redemption Song."" Nearby, demonstrators carried clothing mannequins from a looted Target and threw them onto a burning car. Later, a building fire erupted nearby. But elsewhere in Minneapolis, thousands of peaceful demonstrators marched through the streets calling for justice. Floyd's death has deeply shaken Minneapolis and sparked protests in cities across the U.S. Local leaders have repeatedly urged demonstrators to avoid violence. 'Please stay home. Please do not come here to protest. Please keep the focus on George Floyd, on advancing our movement and on preventing this from ever happening again,' tweeted St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter, who is black. Erika Atson, 20, was among thousands of people who gathered outside government offices in downtown Minneapolis, where organizers had called for a peaceful protest. Many protesters wore masks because of the coronavirus pandemic, but there were few attempts at social distancing. Atson, who is black, described seeing her 14- and 11-year-old brothers tackled by Minneapolis police years ago because officers mistakenly presumed the boys had guns. She said she had been at 'every single protest' since Floyd's death and worried about raising children who could be vulnerable in police encounters. 'We don't want to be here fighting against anyone. We don't want anyone to be hurt. We don't want to cause any damages,' she said. 'We just want the police officer to be held accountable.' The group marched peacefully for three hours before another confrontation with police broke out, though details were scarce. After calling in the Guard, Walz urged widespread changes in the wake of Floyd's death. ""It is time to rebuild. Rebuild the city, rebuild our justice system and rebuild the relationship between law enforcement and those they're charged to protect,' Walz said. Much of the Minneapolis violence occurred in the Longfellow neighborhood, where protesters converged on the precinct station of the police who arrested Floyd. In a strip mall across the street from the 3rd Precinct station, the windows in nearly every business had been smashed, from the large Target department store at one end to the Planet Fitness gym at the other. Only the 24-hour laundromat appeared to have escaped unscathed. 'WHY US?' demanded a large expanse of red graffiti scrawled on the wall of the Target. A Wendy's restaurant across the street was charred almost beyond recognition. Among the casualties of the overnight fires: a six-story building under construction that was to provide nearly 200 apartments of affordable housing. 'We're burning our own neighborhood,' said a distraught Deona Brown, a 24-year-old woman standing with a friend outside the precinct station, where a small group of protesters were shouting at a dozen or so stone-faced police officers in riot gear. 'This is where we live, where we shop, and they destroyed it.' No officers could be seen beyond the station. 'What that cop did was wrong, but I'm scared now,' Brown said. Others in the crowd saw something different in the wreckage. Protesters destroyed property ""because the system is broken,' said a young man who identified himself only by his nickname, Cash, and who said he had been in the streets during the violence. He dismissed the idea that the destruction would hurt residents of the largely black neighborhood. 'They're making money off of us,' he said angrily of the owners of the destroyed stores. He laughed when asked if he had joined in the looting or violence. 'I didn't break anything.' The protests that began Wednesday night and extended into Thursday were more violent than Tuesday's, which included skirmishes between officers and protesters but no widespread property damage. Protests have also spread to other U.S. cities. In New York City, protesters defied New York's coronavirus prohibition on public gatherings Thursday, clashing with police, while demonstrators blocked traffic in downtown Denver and downtown Columbus. A day earlier, demonstrators had taken to the streets in Los Angeles and Memphis. In Louisville, Kentucky, police confirmed that at least seven people had been shot Thursday night as protesters demanded justice for Breonna Taylor, a black woman who was fatally shot by police in her home in March. Amid the violence in Minneapolis, a man was found fatally shot Wednesday night near a pawn shop, possibly by the owner, authorities said. Fire crews responded to about 30 intentionally set blazes on Wednesday, and multiple fire trucks were damaged by rocks and other projectiles, the fire department said. No one was hurt by the blazes. The city on Thursday released a transcript of the 911 call that brought police to the grocery store where Floyd was arrested. The caller described someone paying with a counterfeit bill, with workers rushing outside to find the man sitting on a van. The caller described the man as 'awfully drunk and he's not in control of himself.' Asked by the 911 operator whether the man was 'under the influence of something,' the caller said: 'Something like that, yes. He is not acting right.' Police said Floyd matched the caller's description of the suspect. The U.S. Attorney's Office and the FBI in Minneapolis said Thursday they were conducting 'a robust criminal investigation' into the death. Trump has said he had asked an investigation to be expedited. The FBI is also investigating whether Floyd's civil rights were violated. Chauvin, the officer who kneeled on Floyd's neck, was fired Tuesday with three other officers involved in the arrest. The next day, the mayor called for Chauvin to be criminally charged. He also appealed for the activation of the National Guard. ___ Associated Press writers Steve Karnowski, Jeff Baenen and Doug Glass in Minneapolis, and Gretchen Ehlke in Milwaukee contributed to this report.",0.0

A police spokesman confirmed late Thursday that staff had evacuated the 3rd Precinct station, the focus of many of the protests, 'in the interest of the safety of our personnel"" shortly after 10 p.m. Livestream video showed the protesters entering the building, where fire alarms blared and sprinklers ran as blazes were set. Protesters could be seen setting fire to a Minneapolis Police Department jacket. Late Thursday, President Donald Trump blasted the 'total lack of leadership' in Minneapolis. 'Just spoke to Governor Tim Walz and told him that the Military is with him all the way. Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts,' he said on Twitter. A visibly tired and frustrated Frey made his first public appearance of the night at City Hall near 2 a.m. and took responsibility for evacuating the precinct, saying it had become too dangerous for officers there. As Frey continued, a reporter cut across loudly with a question: 'What's the plan here?' 'With regard to?' Frey responded. Then he added: 'There is a lot of pain and anger right now in our city. I understand that ... What we have seen over the past several hours and past couple of nights here in terms of looting is unacceptable.' He defended the city's lack of engagement with looters "" only a handful of arrests across the first two nights of violence "" and said, 'We are doing absolutely everything that we can to keep the peace.' He said Guard members were being stationed in locations to help stem looting, including banks, grocery stores and pharmacies. Protests first erupted Tuesday, a day after Floyd's death in a confrontation with police captured on widely seen citizen video. On the video, Floyd can be seen pleading as Officer Derek Chauvin presses his knee against him. As minutes pass, Floyd slowly stops talking and moving. The 3rd Precinct covers the portion of south Minneapolis where Floyd was arrested. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz earlier Thursday activated the National Guard at the Minneapolis mayor's request, but it wasn't immediately clear when and where the Guard was being deployed, and none could be seen during protests in Minneapolis or St. Paul. The Guard tweeted minutes after the precinct burned that it had activated more than 500 soldiers across the metro area. The Guard said a 'key objective' was to make sure fire departments could respond to calls, and said in a follow-up tweet it was 'here with the Minneapolis Fire Department' to assist. But no move was made to put out the 3rd Precinct fire. Assistant Fire Chief Bryan Tyner said fire crews could not safely respond to fires at the precinct station and some surrounding buildings. Earlier Thursday, dozens of businesses across the Twin Cities boarded up their windows and doors in an effort to prevent looting, with Minneapolis-based Target announcing it was temporarily closing two dozen area stores. Minneapolis shut down nearly its entire light-rail system and all bus service through Sunday out of safety concerns. In St. Paul, clouds of smoke hung in the air as police armed with batons and wearing gas masks and body armor kept a watchful eye on protesters along one of the city's main commercial corridors, where firefighters also sprayed water onto a series of small fires. At one point, officers stood in line in front of a Target, trying to keep out looters, who were also smashing windows of other businesses. Hundreds of demonstrators returned Thursday to the Minneapolis neighborhood at the center of the violence, where the nighttime scene veered between an angry protest and a street party. At one point, a band playing in a parking lot across from the 3rd Precinct broke into a punk version of Bob Marley's 'Redemption Song."" Nearby, demonstrators carried clothing mannequins from a looted Target and threw them onto a burning car. Later, a building fire erupted nearby. But elsewhere in Minneapolis, thousands of peaceful demonstrators marched through the streets calling for justice. Floyd's death has deeply shaken Minneapolis and sparked protests in cities across the U.S. Local leaders have repeatedly urged demonstrators to avoid violence. 'Please stay home. Please do not come here to protest. Please keep the focus on George Floyd, on advancing our movement and on preventing this from ever happening again,' tweeted St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter, who is black. Erika Atson, 20, was among thousands of people who gathered outside government offices in downtown Minneapolis, where organizers had called for a peaceful protest. Many protesters wore masks because of the coronavirus pandemic, but there were few attempts at social distancing. Atson, who is black, described seeing her 14- and 11-year-old brothers tackled by Minneapolis police years ago because officers mistakenly presumed the boys had guns. She said she had been at 'every single protest' since Floyd's death and worried about raising children who could be vulnerable in police encounters. 'We don't want to be here fighting against anyone. We don't want anyone to be hurt. We don't want to cause any damages,' she said. 'We just want the police officer to be held accountable.' The group marched peacefully for three hours before another confrontation with police broke out, though details were scarce. After calling in the Guard, Walz urged widespread changes in the wake of Floyd's death. ""It is time to rebuild. Rebuild the city, rebuild our justice system and rebuild the relationship between law enforcement and those they're charged to protect,' Walz said. Much of the Minneapolis violence occurred in the Longfellow neighborhood, where protesters converged on the precinct station of the police who arrested Floyd. In a strip mall across the street from the 3rd Precinct station, the windows in nearly every business had been smashed, from the large Target department store at one end to the Planet Fitness gym at the other.

Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear read the statement from Breonna Taylor's mother hours after gunshots erupted during protests late Thursday outside City Hall. One person was in critical condition, Louisville Metro Police said Friday. Mayor Greg Fischer said police officers fired no shots. Instead, they provided aid to the wounded, he said. TV video showed terrified protesters fleeing as gunfire erupted. With more rallies planned Friday, Taylor's mother joined the chorus of calls for protests to remain peaceful. In her statement, Tamika Palmer said her daughter "" an emergency medical technician "" devoted her life to others and the 'last thing she'd want right now is any more violence."" 'Please keep saying her name,"" her statement said. 'Please keep demanding justice and accountability, but let's do it the right way without hurting each other. We can and we will make some real change here. Now is the time. Let's make it happen, but safely.' Beshear, speaking on CNN, said the protest started peacefully but some people later 'turned it into something that it should not have been.' The Democratic governor also called on President Donald Trump to retract a tweet in which he threatened to 'assume control"" in Minneapolis if necessary. The president, reacting to the torching of a Minneapolis police station by protesters outraged by the death of a black man in police custody, warned that 'when the looting starts, the shooting starts.' 'During these times, we can condemn violence while also trying to listen, to understand, to know that there is deep frustration, rightfully so, in our country,"" Beshear said. 'That there has not been enough action on creating equality, of opportunity and in health care. And in a time of this COVID-19 pandemic, it's laid bare all of that."" Bracing for more protests, police said they wouldn't tolerate violence or property destruction. 'We value the right to free speech and understand this community has a lot to say right now,"" Louisville police Lt. Col. LaVita Chavous said. 'We hear you."" But she added that police were prepared to 'take whatever action we must to try to ensure no one else is injured during this time of unrest. We ask the community to please voice your opinions in a peaceful way.' Meanwhile, Louisville's mayor said the use of no-knock warrants by police was being suspended, the latest in a series of policy changes and others actions in response to Taylor's death. 'To the people who gathered downtown last night to protest, and to many more throughout our city and throughout our country who feel angry, hurt, afraid, frustrated, tired and sick of story after story of black lives ending at the hands of law enforcement, I hear you,"" Fischer said. Fischer called for peace, saying the 'fight for justice cannot be won with guns and vandalism.' Two people wounded in the gunfire underwent surgery, while five were in good condition, he said. Local Councilwoman Keisha Dorsey termed the protest as 'a revolt against a system in which people have felt oppressed,"" the Courier Journal reported. 'What I'm seeing is people who are trying their best to do something with their hurt, their pain and their frustration.' Thursday night's demonstration came as protesters across the country, in cities including Los Angeles, Denver, New York and Memphis, turned out in alliance with demonstrators in Minneapolis, where George Floyd became the latest black man to die in police custody. The Louisville protests followed the release of a 911 call Taylor's boyfriend made on March 13, moments after the 26-year-old EMT was shot eight times by narcotics detectives who knocked down her front door. No drugs were found in the home. Hundreds of demonstrators chanting 'No justice, no peace"" marched through downtown Louisville streets. The multiracial protests continued for more than six hours, ending in the early hours of Friday as rain poured down. Windows were broken and several vehicles were damaged during the unrest, police said. Shots were fired into government buildings, including police headquarters, they said. Bricks were thrown into buildings and graffiti was splashed in several places, including a firefighter memorial, they said. The police description of the damage made no reference to any looting. Jordan Basham said she was a few feet from where the people were shot. As people fled in terror, a man she didn't know pushed her to the ground, told her not to move and used his own body to shield her, she said Friday. 'I'll never be able to get that picture out of my mind,"" she said. 'But I am still very glad that I was there. As long as they're out there protesting, I'll be back.' The 24-year-old, white bartender said she hopes future protests remain peaceful but added: 'With what I saw last night and with the way people were acting, it really worries me.'

At least seven people were shot during the protest. (Jada W. via AP) LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) — Looking to defuse tensions in Louisville over the fatal shooting of a black woman by police who broke down her door, the victim’s mother on Friday called on protesters to continue demanding justice but to do it in “the right way without hurting each other.” Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear read the statement from Breonna Taylor’s mother hours after gunshots erupted, wounding at least seven people, during protests late Thursday outside City Hall. At least one person was in critical condition, Louisville Metro Police said early Friday. “No officers discharged their service weapons,” and all seven shot were civilians, police spokesman Sgt. Lamont Washington wrote in an email to The Associated Press. In her statement, Tamika Palmer said her daughter — an emergency medical technician — devoted her life to others, and the “last thing she’d want right now is any more violence.” “Please keep saying her name,” her statement said. “Please keep demanding justice and accountability, but let’s do it the right way without hurting each other.

That there has not been enough action on creating equality, of opportunity and in health care. And in a time of this COVID-19 pandemic, it’s laid bare all of that.” Beshear added that elected officials have “a responsibility, not just to maintain the peace, which is what we ought to be doing, but to also listen, to show empathy, to try to find a way to move in the right direction, not the wrong one.” Louisville’s mayor also called for peace as he said two of the wounded from the gunfire in his city underwent surgery while five were in good condition. “I feel the community’s frustration, the anger, the fear, but tonight’s violence and destruction is not the way to solve it,” Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer said in a video posted to Twitter.

The protests quickly followed the release of a 911 call Taylor’s boyfriend made on March 13, moments after the 26-year-old EMT was shot eight times by narcotics detectives who knocked down her front door. No drugs were found in the home. Around 500 to 600 demonstrators marched through the Kentucky city’s downtown streets, the Courier Journal reported. The protests continued for more than six hours, ending in the early hours of Friday as rain poured down. At one point, protesters took turns hoisting the stone hand of King Louis XVI after it was broken off his statue outside City Hall. Shots were later heard, prompting some of the protesters to scramble for safety. “Understandably, emotions are high,” Fischer tweeted just before midnight, sharing a Facebook post that appealed for people to remain non-violent as they demand justice and accountability. “As Breonna’s mother says let’s be peaceful as we work toward truth and justice,” the mayor wrote.

The case has attracted national headlines alongside the shooting of Ahmaud Arbery in a Georgia neighborhood in February. Around 12:20 a.m., Fischer tweeted a video he said was a message from Taylor’s family. Meanwhile, live video from downtown Louisville around 12:30 a.m. showed some protesters behind makeshift wooden barricades, which appeared to be made out of picnic tables spray-painted with the words “You can’t kill us all.” A small fire inside a trash can was visible in the middle of the street. Police in body armor and face shields held batons and lined up downtown. They appeared to fire rubber bullets and deploy tear gas canisters, fogging the air and inducing coughs among the remaining members of the crowd. Protesters recorded officers with their cellphones.

Ohio Governor Mike DeWine held a news conference Friday to talk about Floyd’s death and the protests in downtown Columbus on Thursday night. “While Fran and I feel sorrow and disgust at what we saw, we cannot fully comprehend or imagine what an African American family must feel,” DeWine said. “His death impacts all of us. We have a responsibility to each other . . . regardless of race, to stand up and speak out and say ‘We won’t tolerate conduct like this.'” Floyd was restrained by officer Derek Chauvin, who dug his knee into Floyd’s neck. Chauvin was arrested Friday and charged with third degree murder and manslaughter. “This officer’s conduct violated every principle of human decency, but it also violated any kind of basic police training,” DeWine said. Peaceful protests in Columbus turned violent when some involved began throwing objects at police officers. Police responded by using tear gas to push the crowd back. The crowd let up, but an hour later the protest escalated when demonstrators smashed windows at the Ohio Statehouse while some went inside the building. “Protests expressing outrage are not only understandable, they are appropriate,” DeWine said. “Ohioans should speak out against wrongdoing. Ohioans should speak out for change . . . I ask my fellow Ohio citizens today as you gather in protest in the coming days throughout Ohio, regardless of the issue, please do so peacefully. We must not fight violence with more violence.” SWAT arrived on the scene soon after the Statehouse break-in. Officers used a loudspeaker to announce an emergency was declared in the area, meaning any protesters who refused to leave would be arrested. “The Columbus Police officers who responded to the Statehouse area yesterday put their own lives at risk and did an excellent job,” DeWine said. “The vast majority, almost all police officers do a good job. But we have a moral obligation to make sure every officer, all 35,000, have the proper training.” More of the damage left behind by tonight’s demonstrations downtown.

(AP) — Looking to defuse tensions in Louisville over the fatal shooting of a black woman by police who broke down her door, the victim’s mother on Friday called on protesters to continue demanding justice but to do it in “the right way without hurting each other.” Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear read the statement from Breonna Taylor’s mother hours after gunshots erupted, wounding at least seven people, during protests late Thursday outside City Hall. At least one person was in critical condition, Louisville Metro Police said early Friday. “No officers discharged their service weapons,” and all seven shot were civilians, police spokesman Sgt.

Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman said Derek Chauvin was charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. Freeman did not provide immediate details, but said a criminal complaint would be made available later Friday and that more charges were possible. In the video, Chauvin is seen kneeling on Floyd’s neck as Floyd is on the ground. He gradually becomes motionless as Chauvin and three other officers ignore bystanders’ shouts to get off him. Freeman said the investigation continues into the other three officers, but that authorities “felt it appropriate to focus on the most dangerous perpetrator.” FILE – In this Monday, May 25, 2020, file frame from video provided by Darnella Frazier, a Minneapolis officer kneels on the neck of George Floyd, a handcuffed man who was pleading that he could not breathe, in Minneapolis. Police around the U.S. and law enforcement experts are broadly condemning the way Floyd, who died in police custody, was restrained by a Minneapolis officer who dug his knee into the man’s neck. (Darnella Frazier via AP, File) Freeman highlighted the “extraordinary speed” in charging the case just four days after Floyd’s death, but also defended himself against questions about why it did not happen sooner. He said his office needed time to put together evidence, including what he called the “horrible” video by a bystander. He said he would not bring a case unless he had enough evidence to prove the charges beyond a reasonable doubt. Protests in Minneapolis escalated in violence on Thursday, when demonstrators torched a police station that officers had abandoned. “I’m not insensitive to what happened in the streets,” Freeman said. “My own home has been picketed regularly.” All four officers who were at the scene of Floyd’s death were fired the next day. After the charges were announced, protesters outside the government center chanted, “All four got to go.” News of the arrest came moments after Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz acknowledged the “abject failure” of the response to the protests and called for swift justice for officers involved. Walz said the state would take over the response to the violence and that it’s time to show respect and dignity to those who are suffering. “Minneapolis and St. Paul are on fire. The fire is still smoldering in our streets. The ashes are symbolic of decades and generations of pain, of anguish unheard,” Walz said, adding. “Now generations of pain is manifesting itself in front of the world — and the world is watching.” The governor cited a call he received from a state senator who described her district “on fire, no police, no firefighters, no social control, constituents locked in houses wondering what they were going to do. That is an abject failure that cannot happen.” His comments came the morning after protesters torched a police station that officers abandoned during a third night of violence. Livestream video showed protesters entering the building, where intentionally set fires activated smoke alarms and sprinklers. President Donald Trump threatened action, tweeting “when the looting starts, the shooting starts,” which prompted a warning from Twitter for “glorifying violence.” The governor faced tough questions after National Guard leader Maj. Gen. Jon Jensen blamed a lack of clarity about the Guard’s mission for a slow response. Walz said the state was in a supporting role and that it was up to city leaders to run the situation. Walz said it became apparent as the 3rd Precinct was lost that the state had to step in, which happened at 12:05 a.m. Requests from the cities for resources “never came,” he said. “You will not see that tonight, there will be no lack of leadership,” Walz said. On Friday morning, nearly every building in the shopping district around the abandoned police station had been vandalized, burned or looted. National Guard members were in the area, with several of them lined up, keeping people away from the police station. Dozens of volunteers swept up broken glass in the street, doing what they could to help. Dean Hanson, 64, lives in a subsidized housing unit nearby, which is home to many older residents. He said his building lost electricity overnight, and residents were terrified as they watched mobs of people run around their neighborhood, with no apparent intervention. “I can’t believe this is happening here,” he said. Dozens of fires were also set in nearby St. Paul, where nearly 200 businesses were damaged or looted. Protests spread across the U.S., fueled by outrage over Floyd’s death, and years of violence against African Americans at the hands of police. Demonstrators clashed with officers in New York and blocked traffic in Columbus, Ohio, and Denver. Trump threatened to bring Minneapolis “under control,” calling the protesters “thugs” and tweeting that “when the looting starts, the shooting starts.” The tweet drew another warning from Twitter, which said the comment violated the platform’s rules, but the company did not remove it. Trump also blasted the “total lack of leadership” in Minneapolis. A visibly tired and frustrated Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey made his first public appearance of the night early Friday at City Hall and took responsibility for evacuating the precinct, saying it had become too dangerous for officers. As Frey continued, a reporter cut across loudly with a question: “What’s the plan here?” “With regard to?” Frey responded. Then he added: “There is a lot of pain and anger right now in our city. I understand that … What we have seen over the past several hours and past couple of nights here in terms of looting is unacceptable.” He defended the city’s lack of engagement with looters — only a handful of arrests across the first two nights of violence — and said, “We are doing absolutely everything that we can to keep the peace.” He said National Guard members were stationed in locations to help stem looting, including at banks, grocery stores and pharmacies. The Minnesota State Patrol arrested a CNN television crew early Friday as the journalists reported on the unrest. While live on air, CNN reporter Omar Jimenez was handcuffed and led away. A producer and a photojournalist for CNN were also taken away in handcuffs. The Minnesota State Patrol said the journalists were among four people arrested as troopers were “clearing the streets and restoring order,” and they were released after being confirmed to be media members. CNN said on Twitter that the arrests were “a clear violation of their First Amendment rights.” Walz publicly apologized on Friday. Attorney Benjamin Crump, who is representing members of Floyd’s family, called for an independent investigation, and said he asked to take custody of Floyd’s body to have an independent autopsy performed. Floyd said that talk of a heart condition or asthma is irrelevant because Floyd was walking and breathing before his contact with police. The doctor who will do the autopsy is Michael Baden, former chief medical examiner of New York City, who was hired to do an autopsy for Eric Garner as well. In New York City, protesters defied New York’s coronavirus prohibition on public gatherings Thursday, clashing with police, while demonstrators blocked traffic in downtown Denver and downtown Columbus. A day earlier, demonstrators had taken to the streets in Los Angeles and Memphis. About 10 protesters went to a Florida home believed to belong to Chauvin. The Orange County Sheriff’s Office tweeted Friday that Chauvin was not at the residence and has no plans to be in the area. In Louisville, Kentucky, police confirmed that at least seven people had been shot Thursday night as protesters demanded justice for Breonna Taylor, a black woman who was fatally shot by police in her home in March. In Mississippi, the mayor of the community of Petal resisted calls to resign following his remarks about Floyd’s death. Hal Marx, a Republican, asked on Twitter: “Why in the world would anyone choose to become a police officer in our society today?” In a follow-up tweet, he said he “didn’t see anything unreasonable.” The city on Thursday released a transcript of the 911 call that brought police to the grocery store where Floyd was arrested. The caller described someone paying with a counterfeit bill, with workers rushing outside to find the man sitting on a van. The caller described the man as “awfully drunk” and said he was “not in control of himself.” Asked by the 911 operator whether the man was “under the influence of something,” the caller said: “Something like that, yes. He is not acting right.” Police said Floyd matched the caller’s description of the suspect. State and federal authorities are investigating Floyd’s death. The owner of a popular Latin nightclub said that Floyd and Chauvin both worked as security guards at the club as recently as the end of last year, but it’s not clear whether they worked together. Chauvin worked at the El Nuevo Rodeo club as an off-duty security guard for nearly two decades, but Floyd had only worked there more recently for about a dozen events that featured African-American music, Maya Santamaria told The Associated Press. Santamaria said if Chauvin had recognized Floyd, “he might have given him a little more mercy.” Associated Press writers Steve Karnowski, Jeff Baenen and Doug Glass in Minneapolis, Gretchen Ehlke in Milwaukee, and Aaron Morrison in New York contributed to this report.",0.0
1620001986,2020-05-29 05:00:08,Minneapolis police station torched amid George Floyd protest,https://www.wpri.com/news/us-and-world/minneapolis-police-station-torched-amid-george-floyd-protest/,en,True,,296268,foxprovidence.com,http://foxprovidence.com/,"MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — The police officer who was seen on video kneeling on the neck of George Floyd, a handcuffed black man who died in custody after pleading that he could not breathe, was arrested Friday and charged with murder in a case that sparked protests across the United States and violence in Minneapolis. Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman said Derek Chauvin was charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. Freeman did not provide immediate details, but said a criminal complaint would be made available later Friday and that more charges were possible. In the video, Chauvin is seen kneeling on Floyd’s neck as Floyd is on the ground. He gradually becomes motionless as Chauvin and three other officers ignore bystanders’ shouts to get off him. Freeman said the investigation continues into the other three officers, but that authorities “felt it appropriate to focus on the most dangerous perpetrator.” FILE – In this Monday, May 25, 2020, file frame from video provided by Darnella Frazier, a Minneapolis officer kneels on the neck of George Floyd, a handcuffed man who was pleading that he could not breathe, in Minneapolis.

(Darnella Frazier via AP, File) Freeman highlighted the “extraordinary speed” in charging the case just four days after Floyd’s death, but also defended himself against questions about why it did not happen sooner. He said his office needed time to put together evidence, including what he called the “horrible” video by a bystander. He said he would not bring a case unless he had enough evidence to prove the charges beyond a reasonable doubt. Protests in Minneapolis escalated in violence on Thursday, when demonstrators torched a police station that officers had abandoned. “I’m not insensitive to what happened in the streets,” Freeman said. “My own home has been picketed regularly.” All four officers who were at the scene of Floyd’s death were fired the next day. After the charges were announced, protesters outside the government center chanted, “All four got to go.” News of the arrest came moments after Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz acknowledged the “abject failure” of the response to the protests and called for swift justice for officers involved. Walz said the state would take over the response to the violence and that it’s time to show respect and dignity to those who are suffering. “Minneapolis and St. Paul are on fire. The fire is still smoldering in our streets. The ashes are symbolic of decades and generations of pain, of anguish unheard,” Walz said, adding. “Now generations of pain is manifesting itself in front of the world — and the world is watching.” The governor cited a call he received from a state senator who described her district “on fire, no police, no firefighters, no social control, constituents locked in houses wondering what they were going to do. That is an abject failure that cannot happen.” His comments came the morning after protesters torched a police station that officers abandoned during a third night of violence. Livestream video showed protesters entering the building, where intentionally set fires activated smoke alarms and sprinklers. President Donald Trump threatened action, tweeting “when the looting starts, the shooting starts,” which prompted a warning from Twitter for “glorifying violence.” The governor faced tough questions after National Guard leader Maj. Gen. Jon Jensen blamed a lack of clarity about the Guard’s mission for a slow response. Walz said the state was in a supporting role and that it was up to city leaders to run the situation. Walz said it became apparent as the 3rd Precinct was lost that the state had to step in, which happened at 12:05 a.m. Requests from the cities for resources “never came,” he said. “You will not see that tonight, there will be no lack of leadership,” Walz said. On Friday morning, nearly every building in the shopping district around the abandoned police station had been vandalized, burned or looted. National Guard members were in the area, with several of them lined up, keeping people away from the police station. Dozens of volunteers swept up broken glass in the street, doing what they could to help. Dean Hanson, 64, lives in a subsidized housing unit nearby, which is home to many older residents. He said his building lost electricity overnight, and residents were terrified as they watched mobs of people run around their neighborhood, with no apparent intervention. “I can’t believe this is happening here,” he said. Dozens of fires were also set in nearby St. Paul, where nearly 200 businesses were damaged or looted. Protests spread across the U.S., fueled by outrage over Floyd’s death, and years of violence against African Americans at the hands of police. Demonstrators clashed with officers in New York and blocked traffic in Columbus, Ohio, and Denver. Trump threatened to bring Minneapolis “under control,” calling the protesters “thugs” and tweeting that “when the looting starts, the shooting starts.” The tweet drew another warning from Twitter, which said the comment violated the platform’s rules, but the company did not remove it. Trump also blasted the “total lack of leadership” in Minneapolis. A visibly tired and frustrated Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey made his first public appearance of the night early Friday at City Hall and took responsibility for evacuating the precinct, saying it had become too dangerous for officers. As Frey continued, a reporter cut across loudly with a question: “What’s the plan here?” “With regard to?” Frey responded. Then he added: “There is a lot of pain and anger right now in our city. I understand that … What we have seen over the past several hours and past couple of nights here in terms of looting is unacceptable.” He defended the city’s lack of engagement with looters — only a handful of arrests across the first two nights of violence — and said, “We are doing absolutely everything that we can to keep the peace.” He said National Guard members were stationed in locations to help stem looting, including at banks, grocery stores and pharmacies. The Minnesota State Patrol arrested a CNN television crew early Friday as the journalists reported on the unrest. While live on air, CNN reporter Omar Jimenez was handcuffed and led away. A producer and a photojournalist for CNN were also taken away in handcuffs. The Minnesota State Patrol said the journalists were among four people arrested as troopers were “clearing the streets and restoring order,” and they were released after being confirmed to be media members. CNN said on Twitter that the arrests were “a clear violation of their First Amendment rights.” Walz publicly apologized on Friday. Attorney Benjamin Crump, who is representing members of Floyd’s family, called for an independent investigation, and said he asked to take custody of Floyd’s body to have an independent autopsy performed. Floyd said that talk of a heart condition or asthma is irrelevant because Floyd was walking and breathing before his contact with police. The doctor who will do the autopsy is Michael Baden, former chief medical examiner of New York City, who was hired to do an autopsy for Eric Garner as well. In New York City, protesters defied New York’s coronavirus prohibition on public gatherings Thursday, clashing with police, while demonstrators blocked traffic in downtown Denver and downtown Columbus. A day earlier, demonstrators had taken to the streets in Los Angeles and Memphis. About 10 protesters went to a Florida home believed to belong to Chauvin. The Orange County Sheriff’s Office tweeted Friday that Chauvin was not at the residence and has no plans to be in the area.

Police nationwide, in unequivocal and unprecedented language, have condemned the actions of Minneapolis police in the custody death of a handcuffed black man who cried for help as an officer knelt on his neck, pinning him to the pavement for at least eight minutes. But some civil rights advocates say their denunciations are empty words without meaningful reform behind them. Authorities say George Floyd was detained Monday because he matched the description of someone who tried to pay with a counterfeit bill at a convenience store, and the 46-year-old resisted arrest. A bystander’s disturbing video shows Officer Derek Chauvin, who is white, kneeling on Floyd’s neck, even as Floyd begs for air and slowly stops talking and moving. “There is no need to see more video,” Chattanooga, Tennessee, Police Chief David Roddy tweeted Wednesday. “There no need to wait to see how ‘it plays out’. There is no need to put a knee on someone’s neck for NINE minutes. There IS a need to DO something.

Sheriffs and police chiefs have strongly criticized the Minneapolis officer on social media and praised the city’s police chief for his quick dismissal of four officers at the scene. Some even called for them to be criminally charged. “I am deeply disturbed by the video of Mr. Floyd being murdered in the street with other officers there letting it go on,” Polk County, Georgia, Sheriff Johnny Moats wrote on Facebook. “I can assure everyone, me or any of my deputies will never treat anyone like that as long as I’m Sheriff. This kind of brutality is terrible and it needs to stop. All Officers involved need to be arrested and charged immediately. Praying for the family.” Typically, police call for patience and calm in the wake of a use of force. They are reluctant to weigh in on episodes involving another agency, often citing ongoing investigations or due process. “Not going hide behind ‘not being there,’” tweeted San Jose Police, California, Chief Eddie Garcia. “I’d be one of the first to condemn anyone had I seen similar happen to one of my brother/ sister officers. What I saw happen to George Floyd disturbed me and is not consistent with the goal of our mission.

Abdullah said the three other officers who witnessed Chauvin’s actions and did not intervene contributed to a long-standing system of police racism and oppression against people of color. “We’ve got to remember that it was not just Officer Chauvin who was sitting on George Floyd’s neck,” she said. Abdullah and hundreds of others protested what she called Floyd’s lynching on Wednesday night. Some blocked lanes of a freeway and shattered windows of California Highway Patrol cruisers. Minneapolis is bracing for more violence after days of civil unrest, with burned buildings, looted stores and angry graffiti demanding justice. The governor on Thursday called in the National Guard. On Thursday night, protesters torched a Minneapolis police station that the department was forced to abandon. The heads of the Los Angeles and Chicago departments — both of which have been rocked before by police brutality scandals — addressed Floyd’s death and its potential effect on race relations between law enforcement and communities of color. Even the New York Police Department weighed in. Eric Garner died in the city in 2014 after he was placed in a chokehold by police and uttered the same words Floyd did: “I can’t breathe.” It took city officials five years to fire the officer, and no criminal or federal charges were brought. “What we saw in Minnesota was deeply disturbing. It was wrong,” NYPD Commissioner Dermot Shea wrote Thursday. “We must take a stand and address it. We must come together, condemn these actions and reinforce who we are as members of the NYPD.

Georgia's governor declared a state of emergency in one county to activate up to 500 members of the state National Guard 'to protect people & property in Atlanta.' Gov. Brian Kemp said in a pair of tweets early Saturday that the move came at the request of Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms and in consultation with emergency officials. The Georgia National Guard will deploy 'immediately' to assist law enforcement, he said. In Minneapolis, where a police precinct was burned the night before, peaceful protests picked up steam as darkness fell, with thousands of people ignoring an 8 p.m. curfew to walk streets in the southern part of the city. Some cars were set on fire in scattered neighborhoods, business break-ins began and eventually there were larger fires. As a pair of restaurants and a Wells Fargo branch were set ablaze, a heavy contingent of National Guard, state troopers and police moved in, some on foot and some in vehicles. In Phoenix, Denver, Las Vegas, Los Angeles and beyond, thousands of protesters carried signs that said: 'He said I can't breathe. Justice for George.' They chanted ''No justice, no peace' and 'Say his name. George Floyd.' After hours of peaceful protest in downtown Atlanta, some demonstrators suddenly turned violent, smashing police cars, setting one on fire, spray-painting the iconic logo sign at CNN headquarters, and breaking into a restaurant. The crowd pelted officers with bottles, chanting 'Quit your jobs.' At least three officers were hurt and there were multiple arrests, Atlanta police spokesman Carlos Campos said. Campos said protesters shot BB guns at officers and threw bricks, bottles and knives at them. People watched the scene from rooftops, some laughing as skirmishes broke out. Bottoms passionately addressed the protesters at a news conference: 'This is not a protest. This is not in the spirit of Martin Luther King Jr.' 'You are disgracing our city,' she told protesters. 'You are disgracing the life of George Floyd and every other person who has been killed in this country. We are better than this. We are better than this as a city. We are better than this as a country. Go home, go home.' Bottoms was flanked by rappers T.I. and Killer Mike, as well as King's daughter, Bernice King. Killer Mike cried as he spoke. 'We have to be better than this moment. We have to be better than burning down our own homes. Because if we lose Atlanta what have we got?' he said. After Mayor Bottoms appealed for calm, the violence continued. More cars were set on fire, a Starbucks was smashed up, the windows of the College Football Hall of Fame were broken, and the iconic Omni Hotel was vandalized. Protesters gathered outside the White House, with President Donald Trump inside, and some tried to push through barriers set up by the U.S. Secret Service along Pennsylvania Avenue. An initially peaceful demonstration in New York City spiraled into chaos as night fell, as protesters skirmished with officers, destroyed police vehicles and set fires. In Brooklyn, activists who had marched from Manhattan chanted insults at officers lined up outside the Barclays Center and pelted them with water bottles. Police sprayed an eye-irritating chemical into the largely diverse crowd multiple times, then cleared the plaza. Video posted to social media showed officers using batons and shoving protesters down as they took people into custody and cleared streets. Demonstrators rocked a police van, set it ablaze, then scrawled graffiti across its charred hulk and set it on fire a second time as officers retreated from the area. Blocks away, protesters used a club to batter another police vehicle. Numerous people were arrested and police brought in buses to carry off those they arrested. 'We have a long night ahead of us in Brooklyn,' Mayor Bill de Blasio tweeted. 'Our sole focus is deescalating this situation and getting people home safe. There will be a full review of what happened tonight. We don't ever want to see another night like this.' The police department said numerous officers were injured, including one who had a tooth knocked out. The names of black people killed by police, including Floyd and Eric Garner, who died on Staten Island in 2014, were on signs carried by those in the crowd, and in their chants. 'It's my duty to be out here,' said Brianna Petrisko, among those at Foley Square in lower Manhattan, where most were wearing masks amid the coronavirus pandemic. 'Our country has a sickness. We have to be out here. This is the only way we're going to be heard.' In Houston, where George Floyd grew up, several thousand people rallied in front of City Hall. Among them was 19-year-old Jimmy Ohaz, who came from the nearby city of Richmond, Texas. 'My question is how many more, how many more? I just want to live in a future where we all live in harmony and we're not oppressed.' Tensions rose in several West Coast cities as night fell and protesters blocked highways in Los Angeles and Oakland. About 1,000 protesters gathered in Oakland. They smashed windows, sprayed buildings with ""Kill Cops' graffiti and were met with chemical spray from police. Oakland Police were notifying a crowd that the demonstrationwas an unlawful assembly. Authorities said officers were injured when projectiles were thrown and that they were asking people to leave the area. Demonstrators in Los Angeles scuffled at times with police, with a few protesters detained and one officer receiving medical treatment, police said. An LAPD vehicle had its windows smashed, and CNN reported that someone wrote 'killer' on a patrol car. Protesters repeatedly clashed with police in the Silicon Valley city of San Jose, said Mayor Sam Liccardo, and police responded with flash-bang grenades and rubber bullets. One officer was being treated at a hospital for an injury that was not life-threatening, he and police officials said. Liccardo said his own officers shared the community's outrage over Floyd's in-custody death. 'It was a horrible injustice. I'd venture to guess that every police officer out there feels much of the same anger about what happened in Minneapolis,' he told The Associated Press. Thirty miles to the west, Santa Cruz police chief Andrew G. Mills said in a statement that the actions by Minneapolis officers in Floyd's death 'are the antithesis of what we view as good policing.'",0.0

Bottoms passionately addressed the protesters at a news conference: 'This is not a protest. This is not in the spirit of Martin Luther King Jr.' 'You are disgracing our city,' she told protesters. 'You are disgracing the life of George Floyd and every other person who has been killed in this country. We are better than this. We are better than this as a city. We are better than this as a country. Go home, go home.' Bottoms was flanked by rappers T.I. and Killer Mike, as well as King's daughter, Bernice King. Killer Mike cried as he spoke. 'We have to be better than this moment. We have to be better than burning down our own homes. Because if we lose Atlanta what have we got?' he said. After Mayor Bottoms appealed for calm, the violence continued. More cars were set on fire, a Starbucks was smashed up, the windows of the College Football Hall of Fame were broken, and the iconic Omni Hotel was vandalized. Protesters gathered outside the White House, with President Donald Trump inside, and some tried to push through barriers set up by the U.S. Secret Service along Pennsylvania Avenue. An initially peaceful demonstration in New York City spiraled into chaos as night fell, as protesters skirmished with officers, destroyed police vehicles and set fires. In Brooklyn, activists who had marched from Manhattan chanted insults at officers lined up outside the Barclays Center and pelted them with water bottles. Police sprayed an eye-irritating chemical into the largely diverse crowd multiple times, then cleared the plaza. Video posted to social media showed officers using batons and shoving protesters down as they took people into custody and cleared streets. Demonstrators rocked a police van, set it ablaze, then scrawled graffiti across its charred hulk and set it on fire a second time as officers retreated from the area. Blocks away, protesters used a club to batter another police vehicle. Numerous people were arrested and police brought in buses to carry off those they arrested. 'We have a long night ahead of us in Brooklyn,' Mayor Bill de Blasio tweeted. 'Our sole focus is deescalating this situation and getting people home safe. There will be a full review of what happened tonight. We don't ever want to see another night like this.' The police department said numerous officers were injured, including one who had a tooth knocked out. The names of black people killed by police, including Floyd and Eric Garner, who died on Staten Island in 2014, were on signs carried by those in the crowd, and in their chants. 'It's my duty to be out here,' said Brianna Petrisko, among those at Foley Square in lower Manhattan, where most were wearing masks amid the coronavirus pandemic. 'Our country has a sickness. We have to be out here. This is the only way we're going to be heard.' In Houston, where George Floyd grew up, several thousand people rallied in front of City Hall. Among them was 19-year-old Jimmy Ohaz, who came from the nearby city of Richmond, Texas. 'My question is how many more, how many more? I just want to live in a future where we all live in harmony and we're not oppressed.' Tensions rose in several West Coast cities as night fell and protesters blocked highways in Los Angeles and Oakland. About 1,000 protesters gathered in Oakland. They smashed windows, sprayed buildings with ""Kill Cops' graffiti and were met with chemical spray from police. Oakland Police were notifying a crowd that the demonstrationwas an unlawful assembly. Authorities said officers were injured when projectiles were thrown and that they were asking people to leave the area. Demonstrators in Los Angeles scuffled at times with police, with a few protesters detained and one officer receiving medical treatment, police said. An LAPD vehicle had its windows smashed, and CNN reported that someone wrote 'killer' on a patrol car. Protesters repeatedly clashed with police in the Silicon Valley city of San Jose, said Mayor Sam Liccardo, and police responded with flash-bang grenades and rubber bullets. One officer was being treated at a hospital for an injury that was not life-threatening, he and police officials said. Liccardo said his own officers shared the community's outrage over Floyd's in-custody death. 'It was a horrible injustice. I'd venture to guess that every police officer out there feels much of the same anger about what happened in Minneapolis,' he told The Associated Press. Thirty miles to the west, Santa Cruz police chief Andrew G. Mills said in a statement that the actions by Minneapolis officers in Floyd's death 'are the antithesis of what we view as good policing.'",0.0

Tim Walz on Friday acknowledged the ""abject failure"" of the response to this week's violent protests and called for swift justice for police involved in the death of George Floyd, a handcuffed black man who pleaded for air as a white officer knelt on his neck. Walz said the state would take over the response and that it's time to show respect and dignity to those who are suffering. ""Minneapolis and St. Paul are on fire. The fire is still smoldering in our streets. The ashes are symbolic of decades and generations of pain, of anguish unheard,"" Walz said, adding. ""Now generations of pain is manifesting itself in front of the world — and the world is watching."" The governor cited a call he received from a state senator who described her district ""on fire, no police, no firefighters, no social control, constituents locked in houses wondering what they were going to do. That is an abject failure that cannot happen."" His comments came the morning after protesters torched a police station that officers abandoned during a third night of violence. Livestream video showed protesters entering the building, where intentionally set fires activated smoke alarms and sprinklers. President Donald Trump threatened action, tweeting ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts,"" which prompted a warning from Twitter for ""glorifying violence."" The governor faced tough questions after National Guard leader Maj. Gen. Jon Jensen blamed a lack of clarity about the Guard's mission for a slow response. Walz said the state was in a supporting role and that it was up to city leaders to run the situation. Walz said it became apparent as the 3rd Precinct was lost that the state had to step in, which happened at 12:05 a.m. Requests from the cities for resources ""never came,"" he said. ""You will not see that tonight, there will be no lack of leadership,"" Walz said. Dozens of fires were also set in nearby St. Paul, where nearly 200 businesses were damaged or looted. Protests spread across the U.S., fueled by outrage over Floyd's death, and years of violence against African Americans at the hands of police. Demonstrators clashed with officers in New York and blocked traffic in Columbus, Ohio, and Denver. Trump threatened to bring Minneapolis ""under control,"" calling the protesters ""thugs"" and tweeting that ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts."" The tweet drew another warning from Twitter, which said the comment violated the platform's rules, but the company did not remove it. Trump also blasted the ""total lack of leadership"" in Minneapolis. A visibly tired and frustrated Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey made his first public appearance of the night early Friday at City Hall and took responsibility for evacuating the precinct, saying it had become too dangerous for officers. As Frey continued, a reporter cut across loudly with a question: ""What's the plan here?"" ""With regard to?"" Frey responded. Then he added: ""There is a lot of pain and anger right now in our city. I understand that ... What we have seen over the past several hours and past couple of nights here in terms of looting is unacceptable."" He defended the city's lack of engagement with looters — only a handful of arrests across the first two nights of violence — and said, ""We are doing absolutely everything that we can to keep the peace."" He said National Guard members were stationed in locations to help stem looting, including at banks, grocery stores and pharmacies. The Minnesota State Patrol arrested a CNN television crew early Friday as the journalists reported on the unrest. While live on air, CNN reporter Omar Jimenez was handcuffed and led away. A producer and a photojournalist for CNN were also taken away in handcuffs. The Minnesota State Patrol said the journalists were among four people arrested as troopers were ""clearing the streets and restoring order,"" and they were released after being confirmed to be media members. CNN said on Twitter that the arrests were ""a clear violation of their First Amendment rights."" Firefighters worked Friday to contain a number of blazes as National Guard troops blocked access to streets where businesses had been damaged. They marched side by side and block by block as they expanded a perimeter around a heavily damaged area. Protests first erupted Tuesday, a day after Floyd's death in a confrontation with police captured on widely seen citizen video. In the footage, Floyd can be seen pleading as officer Derek Chauvin presses his knee against him. As minutes pass, Floyd slowly stops talking and moving. Minutes after the precinct burned, the Guard tweeted that it had activated more than 500 soldiers across the metro area. By Friday morning, a couple dozen Guard members armed with assault-style rifles blocked a street near a Target store that has sustained heavy damage by looters. The Guard said a ""key objective"" was to make sure firefighters could respond to calls, and said in a follow-up tweet that soldiers would assist the Minneapolis Fire Department. But no move was made to put out the 3rd Precinct fire. Assistant Fire Chief Bryan Tyner said fire crews could not safely respond to blazes at the precinct station and some surrounding buildings. Elsewhere in Minneapolis, thousands of peaceful demonstrators marched through the streets calling for justice. In New York City, protesters defied New York's coronavirus prohibition on public gatherings Thursday, clashing with police, while demonstrators blocked traffic in downtown Denver and downtown Columbus. A day earlier, demonstrators had taken to the streets in Los Angeles and Memphis. About 10 protesters went to a Florida home believed to belong to Chauvin. The Orange County Sheriff's Office tweeted Friday that Chauvin was not at the residence and has no plans to be in the area. In Louisville, Kentucky, police confirmed that at least seven people had been shot Thursday night as protesters demanded justice for Breonna Taylor, a black woman who was fatally shot by police in her home in March. In Mississippi, the mayor of the community of Petal resisted calls to resign following his remarks about Floyd's death. Hal Marx, a Republican, asked on Twitter: ""Why in the world would anyone choose to become a police officer in our society today?"" In a follow-up tweet, he said he ""didn't see anything unreasonable."" The city on Thursday released a transcript of the 911 call that brought police to the grocery store where Floyd was arrested. The caller described someone paying with a counterfeit bill, with workers rushing outside to find the man sitting on a van. The caller described the man as ""awfully drunk"" and said he was ""not in control of himself."" Asked by the 911 operator whether the man was ""under the influence of something,"" the caller said: ""Something like that, yes. He is not acting right."" Police said Floyd matched the caller's description of the suspect. State and federal authorities are investigating Floyd's death. Chauvin, the officer who knelt on Floyd's neck, was fired Tuesday, along with three other officers involved in the arrest. ___ Associated Press writers Steve Karnowski, Jeff Baenen and Doug Glass in Minneapolis, Gretchen Ehlke in Milwaukee, and Aaron Morrison in New York contributed to this report.",0.0

1620308499,2020-05-29 12:28:46,The Latest: Attorneys seek outside probe of Floyd's death,https://www.providencejournal.com/ZZ/news/20200529/latest-attorneys-seek-outside-probe-of-floyds-death?rssfeed=true,en,True,,68874,providencejournal.com,http://www.providencejournal.com/#spider,"MINNEAPOLIS (AP) "" The Latest on the death of George Floyd, a handcuffed black man who pleaded for air as a white police officer knelt on his neck (all times local): 4:15 p.m. NBA veteran Stephen Jackson says he'll use his platform and 'everything I have to get a conviction' for the four Minneapolis police officers who were fired after George Floyd's death. Jackson, like Floyd, is from Houston and they were friends. The handcuffed black man died after pleading for air as a white Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck. That officer, Derek Chauvin, was arrested Friday and charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. The charges were announced shortly after Jackson spoke at a news conference organized by activists at Minneapolis City Hall. Actor Jamie Foxx and Minnesota Timberwolves star Karl-Anthony Towns were among those in attendance. Jackson is 42. He played for eight NBA teams from 2000-2013 and won a championship in 2003 with the San Antonio Spurs. He and Floyd called each other 'twin' because of their resemblance. Both were star high school athletes in the Houston area in the 1990s. Floyd had moved to Minneapolis two years ago for a fresh start. ___ 4 p.m. A white Minneapolis police officer who is charged with murder for kneeling on George Floyd's neck as he pleaded for air is accused of ignoring another officer who was worried that the handcuffed black man should be rolled onto his side. Derek Chauvin, 44, was charged Friday with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. The criminal complaint also says that an autopsy revealed nothing to support strangulation. It says the medical examiner concluded that the combined effects of being restrained, potential intoxicants in Floyd's system, and his underlying health issues likely contributed to his death. The complaint says Floyd was struggling with officers who tried to put him in a squad car and at one point he went to the ground face down. The complaint says one officer held Floyd's back and another held his legs, while Chauvin put his knee on Floyd's head and neck area. When one officer said he was getting worried and asked if Floyd should be rolled onto his side, Chauvin said no. In all, Chauvin had his knee on Floyd's neck for eight minutes and 46 seconds. The complaint says that includes nearly three minutes after Floyd stopped moving and talking. Chauvin's attorney had no comment when reached by The Associated Press. ___ 3:45 p.m. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey has declared a nighttime curfew running from 8 p.m. Friday to 6 a.m. Saturday and again from 8 p.m. Saturday through 6 a.m. Sunday. His order comes after sometimes violent protests over the death of George Floyd. The handcuffed black man pleaded for air as a white police officer knelt on his neck. Frey's order said nobody may venture out in public during those times, except for emergency responders, or people seeking medical care, fleeing dangerous circumstances or experiencing homelessness. Violators can be fined up to $1,000 and jailed up to 90 days. ___ 2:20 p.m. U.S. Attorney General William Barr says he's 'confident justice will be served' after the restraint death of a black man in Minneapolis police custody. Barr said in a statement Friday that the videos of George Floyd's death were 'harrowing to watch and deeply disturbing.' The Justice Department and FBI are conducting an investigation to determine whether federal civil rights laws were broken. Barr's comments come as the white police officer who was seen on video kneeling on Floyd's neck was arrested. Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman said Derek Chauvin was charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. Barr says a decision whether to pursue federal charges 'must be, and will be, based on the law and facts' and that the process is 'proceeding quickly.' He said federal officials were working with local law enforcement to ensure relevant evidence is collected as quickly as possible. ___ 1:45 p.m. An uncle of a black man who died in police custody in Minneapolis said he will be attending peaceful demonstrations, but that violent protests are 'absolutely outlandish.' Selwyn Jones' nephew George Floyd died Monday after a white officer knelt on his neck as Floyd pleaded for air. Floyd's death has set off days of protests in the Minneapolis area and communities across the U.S. 'I think that is absolutely outlandish for them to destroy their own city, their own home, to make a point,' Jones told the Rapid City Journal in South Dakota. 'I don't think the point that they're trying to make is the point that we're trying to make.' Jones is planning to attend a walk in memory of Floyd on Saturday in Rapid City. He said people who have reacted with violent protest and looting are 'taking advantage of a bad situation to express anger.' ___ 1:30 p.m. Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden says he has spoken with the family of George Floyd and is calling for justice. Biden's comments came as a Minnesota prosecutor announced charges against a police officer seen kneeling on Floyd's neck. Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman says Derek Chauvin is charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter in the restraint death of Floyd. In a brief online appearance Friday, the former vice president blamed systemic racism, which he called 'an open wound' on American society, for Floyd's death. He says it's time for deep and lasting police reform. Biden also took an indirect swipe at President Donald Trump without naming him, saying it was, 'No time for incendiary tweets. No time to incite violence.' ___ 1:15 p.m. A Minnesota prosecutor has charged a police officer with third-degree murder and manslaughter in the restraint death of George Floyd. Floyd is the handcuffed black man whose cries of 'I can't breathe' in a widely seen cellphone video set off days of violent protest in Minneapolis and around the country. Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman said Friday that he may yet bring more charges against the officer, Derek Chauvin. The white officer knelt on Floyd's neck for at least eight minutes in the video. Floyd can be seen gradually becoming motionless as Chauvin and three other officers ignored bystanders' shouts to get off him. Floyd was pronounced dead at a Minneapolis hospital in an incident that began when police responded to a report of a man passing a counterfeit bill in a grocery store on Memorial Day. The charges came after Minneapolis has been rocked by three days of protests, including looting, scores of fires and the burning of a police precinct station on Thursday even after the governor called out the National Guard. ___ 12:45 p.m. Russia's Foreign Ministry is responding to the death of George Floyd. The ministry says in a lengthy statement that the death underlines frequent violence by police in the United States. Floyd pleaded for air as a white police officer knelt on the handcuffed black man's neck. The officer, Derek Chauvin, was arrested Friday. The statement from the Russian Foreign Ministry says, 'This incident is far from the first in a series of manifestations of lawlessness and unjustified violence by the 'law enforcement officers' in the United States."" The ministry called on the U.S. to 'to take real and effective measures to rectify the situation, return to the conscientious fulfillment of international obligations, and bring national legislation in line with the basic UN principles on the use of force and firearms by law enforcement agencies."" ___ 12:25 p.m. Minnesota authorities say the police officer who knelt on George Floyd has been arrested. Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington said Friday that state investigators arrested Derek Chauvin. Chauvin is the white officer who was seen on video kneeling on the neck of Floyd, a handcuffed black man. The arrest comes after three days of protests, which escalated in violence as demonstrators torched a police precinct that had been abandoned by officers. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz on Friday acknowledged the 'abject failure' of the response to this week's violent protests. Walz said the state would take over the response and that it's time to show respect and dignity to those who are suffering. ___ 12:05 p.m. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz is acknowledging the 'abject failure' of the response to this week's protests over the death of George Floyd. During a news conference on Friday, Walz said the state would take over the response. He says it's time to show respect and dignity to those who are suffering. He also called for swift justice for officers involved in Floyd's death. The handcuffed black man pleaded for air as a white officer knelt on his neck. Walz's comments came after protesters torched a police station that officers abandoned during a third night of violence. Livestream video showed protesters entering the building, where intentionally set fires activated smoke alarms and sprinklers. ___ 11:30 a.m. Attorneys for the families of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor are calling for an independent investigation of the actions leading to Floyd's death. They also want national reforms in response to the three deaths. Attorney Benjamin Crump said during a news conference Friday that he's asked to take custody of Floyd's body for an independent autopsy. He and attorney Lee Merritt said they want murder charges brought against the four Minneapolis police officers involved in Floyd's arrest. And they want the Minnesota attorney general to take over the investigation. Crump says the families from Georgia, Kentucky and now Minnesota have all had to dispel narratives from law enforcement that their loved ones 'brought this upon themselves.' They cited an initial report in Floyd's case that said he threatened police and died of a medical condition. Videos show an officer kneeling on the back of Floyd's neck as the handcuffed black man pleads for air. The attorneys said they'll seek national legislation seeking better training and to lower the burden to charge officers for excessive force. ___ 11 a.m. A now-fired police officer and a black man who died in his custody both worked as security guards at a popular Latin nightclub as recently as the end of last year. But the club's former owner says it's not clear whether they knew each other. Officer Derek Chauvin worked at the El Nuevo Rodeo club as off-duty security for nearly two decades. Maya Santamaria told The Associated Press that George Floyd had worked there only more recently for about a dozen events that featured African American music. Santamaria says she doesn't believe the two knew each other before their encounter Monday night when the officer was seen on cellphone video kneeling on Floyd's neck. Santamaria says that if the officer had recognized Floyd, 'He might have given him a little more mercy.' Santamaria sold the venue within the past two months. She says Chauvin got along well with the regular Latino customers, but didn't like to work the African American nights. When he did, and there was a fight, he would spray people with mace and call for police backup. She says a half dozen squad cars would soon show up, something she felt was unjustified 'overkill. ___ 7 a.m. Thick smoke is hovering over Minneapolis after cheering protesters torched a police station that officers abandoned. The fire came during a third night of violent protests flared over the death of George Floyd. The handcuffed black man pleaded for air as a white police officer knelt on his neck. The focus of many of the protests has been the 3rd Precinct station. A spokesman says police abandoned it late Thursday to protect employees.

Tim Walz on Friday acknowledged the ""abject failure"" of the response to this week's violent protests and called for swift justice for police involved in the death of George Floyd, a handcuffed black man who pleaded for air as a white officer knelt on his neck. Walz said the state would take over the response and that it's time to show respect and dignity to those who are suffering. ""Minneapolis and St. Paul are on fire. The fire is still smoldering in our streets. The ashes are symbolic of decades and generations of pain, of anguish unheard,"" Walz said, adding. ""Now generations of pain is manifesting itself in front of the world — and the world is watching."" The governor cited a call he received from a state senator who described her district ""on fire, no police, no firefighters, no social control, constituents locked in houses wondering what they were going to do. That is an abject failure that cannot happen."" His comments came the morning after protesters torched a police station that officers abandoned during a third night of violence. Livestream video showed protesters entering the building, where intentionally set fires activated smoke alarms and sprinklers. President Donald Trump threatened action, tweeting ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts,"" which prompted a warning from Twitter for ""glorifying violence."" The governor faced tough questions after National Guard leader Maj. Gen. Jon Jensen blamed a lack of clarity about the Guard's mission for a slow response. Walz said the state was in a supporting role and that it was up to city leaders to run the situation. Walz said it became apparent as the 3rd Precinct was lost that the state had to step in, which happened at 12:05 a.m. Requests from the cities for resources ""never came,"" he said. ""You will not see that tonight, there will be no lack of leadership,"" Walz said. Dozens of fires were also set in nearby St. Paul, where nearly 200 businesses were damaged or looted. Protests spread across the U.S., fueled by outrage over Floyd's death, and years of violence against African Americans at the hands of police. Demonstrators clashed with officers in New York and blocked traffic in Columbus, Ohio, and Denver. Trump threatened to bring Minneapolis ""under control,"" calling the protesters ""thugs"" and tweeting that ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts."" The tweet drew another warning from Twitter, which said the comment violated the platform's rules, but the company did not remove it. Trump also blasted the ""total lack of leadership"" in Minneapolis. A visibly tired and frustrated Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey made his first public appearance of the night early Friday at City Hall and took responsibility for evacuating the precinct, saying it had become too dangerous for officers. As Frey continued, a reporter cut across loudly with a question: ""What's the plan here?"" ""With regard to?"" Frey responded. Then he added: ""There is a lot of pain and anger right now in our city. I understand that ... What we have seen over the past several hours and past couple of nights here in terms of looting is unacceptable."" He defended the city's lack of engagement with looters — only a handful of arrests across the first two nights of violence — and said, ""We are doing absolutely everything that we can to keep the peace."" He said National Guard members were stationed in locations to help stem looting, including at banks, grocery stores and pharmacies. The Minnesota State Patrol arrested a CNN television crew early Friday as the journalists reported on the unrest. While live on air, CNN reporter Omar Jimenez was handcuffed and led away. A producer and a photojournalist for CNN were also taken away in handcuffs. The Minnesota State Patrol said the journalists were among four people arrested as troopers were ""clearing the streets and restoring order,"" and they were released after being confirmed to be media members. CNN said on Twitter that the arrests were ""a clear violation of their First Amendment rights."" Firefighters worked Friday to contain a number of blazes as National Guard troops blocked access to streets where businesses had been damaged. They marched side by side and block by block as they expanded a perimeter around a heavily damaged area. Protests first erupted Tuesday, a day after Floyd's death in a confrontation with police captured on widely seen citizen video. In the footage, Floyd can be seen pleading as officer Derek Chauvin presses his knee against him. As minutes pass, Floyd slowly stops talking and moving. Minutes after the precinct burned, the Guard tweeted that it had activated more than 500 soldiers across the metro area. By Friday morning, a couple dozen Guard members armed with assault-style rifles blocked a street near a Target store that has sustained heavy damage by looters. The Guard said a ""key objective"" was to make sure firefighters could respond to calls, and said in a follow-up tweet that soldiers would assist the Minneapolis Fire Department. But no move was made to put out the 3rd Precinct fire. Assistant Fire Chief Bryan Tyner said fire crews could not safely respond to blazes at the precinct station and some surrounding buildings. Elsewhere in Minneapolis, thousands of peaceful demonstrators marched through the streets calling for justice. In New York City, protesters defied New York's coronavirus prohibition on public gatherings Thursday, clashing with police, while demonstrators blocked traffic in downtown Denver and downtown Columbus. A day earlier, demonstrators had taken to the streets in Los Angeles and Memphis. About 10 protesters went to a Florida home believed to belong to Chauvin. The Orange County Sheriff's Office tweeted Friday that Chauvin was not at the residence and has no plans to be in the area. In Louisville, Kentucky, police confirmed that at least seven people had been shot Thursday night as protesters demanded justice for Breonna Taylor, a black woman who was fatally shot by police in her home in March. In Mississippi, the mayor of the community of Petal resisted calls to resign following his remarks about Floyd's death. Hal Marx, a Republican, asked on Twitter: ""Why in the world would anyone choose to become a police officer in our society today?"" In a follow-up tweet, he said he ""didn't see anything unreasonable."" The city on Thursday released a transcript of the 911 call that brought police to the grocery store where Floyd was arrested. The caller described someone paying with a counterfeit bill, with workers rushing outside to find the man sitting on a van. The caller described the man as ""awfully drunk"" and said he was ""not in control of himself."" Asked by the 911 operator whether the man was ""under the influence of something,"" the caller said: ""Something like that, yes. He is not acting right."" Police said Floyd matched the caller's description of the suspect. State and federal authorities are investigating Floyd's death. Chauvin, the officer who knelt on Floyd's neck, was fired Tuesday, along with three other officers involved in the arrest. ___ Associated Press writers Steve Karnowski, Jeff Baenen and Doug Glass in Minneapolis, Gretchen Ehlke in Milwaukee, and Aaron Morrison in New York contributed to this report.",0.0

The tweet drew a warning from Twitter for Trump’s rhetoric, with the social media giant saying he had “violated the Twitter Rules about glorifying violence.” (Twitter via AP) Twitter escalated tensions with President Donald Trump on Friday, adding a warning to one of his tweets for the first time and saying he violated the platform’s rules by glorifying violence when he suggested protesters in Minneapolis could be shot. Trump has been railing against the company since earlier this week, when it for the first time applied fact checks to two of his tweets. Those were about mail-in ballots. The flap comes at a fraught moment for Twitter and social media more generally. Debate is heating up about when and how much these companies should police the content on their platforms as coronavirus misinformation swirls and the 2020 U.S. presidential election looms. For Trump, the feud with Twitter serves as a convenient distraction from major challenges he faces heading into November, such as controlling a pandemic and dealing with soaring unemployment. The Trump tweet that was flagged Friday came amid days of violent protests over the death of George Floyd, a handcuffed black man who pleaded for air as a white police officer kneeled on his neck. “These THUGS are dishonoring the memory of George Floyd, and I won’t let that happen,” Trump tweeted about the protesters. “Just spoke to Governor Tim Walz and told him that the Military is with him all the way. Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts. Thank you!” The comment evoked the civil-rights era by borrowing a phrase used in 1967 by Miami’s police chief to warn of an aggressive police response to unrest in black neighborhoods. Twitter did not remove the tweet, saying it had determined it might be in the public interest to have it remain accessible. But the tweet was hidden so that a user looking at Trump’s timeline would have to click on the warning to see the original tweet. Hiding it also effectively demotes the tweet by limiting how users can retweet it and ensuring that Twitter algorithms don’t recommend it. Twitter said Friday it posted the warning label on Trump’s tweet “based on the historical context of the last line, its connection to violence, and the risk it could inspire similar actions today,” but left it up “given its relevance to ongoing matters of public importance.” A tweet using the same language as Trump’s was later posted on the official White House Twitter account, and Twitter eventually put a warning on that too. It was also posted on Facebook, which hasn’t taken any visible action on it. Twitter taking a harder line than Facebook on Trump’s posts likely has something to do with Twitter’s decision last year to stop taking political ads, said Melissa Ryan, CEO of consultancy group Card Strategies, which researches online disinformation and right-wing extremism. She said the coronavirus pandemic has also led Twitter to inch toward stronger enforcement of its policies at the same time that Trump’s tweets have “amped up in terms of crazy and intensity and disinformation.” “Twitter and Trump have been playing a game of chicken,” Ryan said. “It feels like they’ve both been moving toward this for a while.” Trump took to Twitter to complain, calling multiple times for the revocation of Section 230, part of a 1996 law overhauling telecommunications. That section generally protects social media platforms from liability for material users post on their platforms. Trump on Thursday signed an executive order challenging those protections. The order directs executive branch agencies to ask independent rule-making agencies including the Federal Communications Commission and the Federal Trade Commission to study whether they can place new regulations on the companies, though experts express doubts much can be done without an act of Congress. The president and fellow conservatives have claimed for years that Silicon Valley tech companies are biased against them. But there is no evidence for this, and while the executives and many employees of Twitter, Facebook and Google may lean liberal, the companies have stressed they have no business interest in favoring one political party over the other. Twitter first outlined in early 2018 that it wouldn’t block world leaders from the platform or remove their controversial tweets. But it announced nearly a year ago that it could apply warning labels and obscure the tweets of world leaders if they used their accounts to threaten or abuse others. That followed complaints from Trump critics that the president has gotten a free pass from Twitter to post hateful messages and attack his enemies in ways they say could lead to violence. Twitter further clarified its rules in October, saying it will enforce its policies against any user who makes clear and direct threats of violence against a person, but carving out an exception for government officials’ “foreign policy saber-rattling on economic or military issues.” The earlier tweets that Twitter flagged were not hidden but did come with an option to “get the facts about mail-in ballots,” a link that led to fact checks and news stories by media organizations. Those tweets called mail-in ballots “fraudulent” and predicted that “mail boxes will be robbed,” among other things. Twitter’s decision to flag Trump’s tweets came as the president continued to use the platform to push a debunked conspiracy theory accusing MSNBC host and former congressman Joe Scarborough of killing a staffer in his Florida congressional office in 2001. Medical officials determined the staffer had an undiagnosed heart condition, passed out and hit her head as she fell. Scarborough, who was in Washington, not Florida, at the time, has urged the president to stop his baseless attacks. The staffer’s husband also recently demanded that Twitter remove the tweets. The company issued a statement expressing its regret to the husband but so far has taken no other action. Twitter’s decision also likely will be seized upon outside the U.S. to scrutinize the social media behavior of other world leaders. Israel has been waging its own pressure campaign on the company over it allowing Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to have an account. In a letter dated Sunday, an Israeli official wrote to Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey complaining about Khamenei tweets that repeated comments he made in a recent speech in support of Palestinians that called Israel a “cancerous growth” that will be “uprooted and destroyed.” On the other hand, the company has removed tweets related to the coronavirus from the leaders of Brazil and Venezuela, and says it will remove content that has a call to action that poses a threat to people’s health or well being. It has also previously used the warning label for an elected official, Brazilian politician Osmar Terra, who tweeted that quarantine increases the spread of the virus.",0.0

1620380331,2020-05-29 13:47:03,The Latest: Biden responds to Floyd's death; officer charged,https://www.newportri.com/ZZ/news/20200529/latest-biden-responds-to-floyds-death-officer-charged?rssfeed=true,en,True,,662950,Newport Daily News,http://www.newportdailynews.com/ee/newportdailynews/index.php,"MINNEAPOLIS (AP) "" The Latest on the death of George Floyd, a handcuffed black man who pleaded for air as a white police officer knelt on his neck (all times local): 4:15 p.m. NBA veteran Stephen Jackson says he'll use his platform and 'everything I have to get a conviction' for the four Minneapolis police officers who were fired after George Floyd's death. Jackson, like Floyd, is from Houston and they were friends. The handcuffed black man died after pleading for air as a white Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck. That officer, Derek Chauvin, was arrested Friday and charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. The charges were announced shortly after Jackson spoke at a news conference organized by activists at Minneapolis City Hall. Actor Jamie Foxx and Minnesota Timberwolves star Karl-Anthony Towns were among those in attendance. Jackson is 42. He played for eight NBA teams from 2000-2013 and won a championship in 2003 with the San Antonio Spurs. He and Floyd called each other 'twin' because of their resemblance. Both were star high school athletes in the Houston area in the 1990s. Floyd had moved to Minneapolis two years ago for a fresh start. ___ 4 p.m. A white Minneapolis police officer who is charged with murder for kneeling on George Floyd's neck as he pleaded for air is accused of ignoring another officer who was worried that the handcuffed black man should be rolled onto his side. Derek Chauvin, 44, was charged Friday with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. The criminal complaint also says that an autopsy revealed nothing to support strangulation. It says the medical examiner concluded that the combined effects of being restrained, potential intoxicants in Floyd's system, and his underlying health issues likely contributed to his death. The complaint says Floyd was struggling with officers who tried to put him in a squad car and at one point he went to the ground face down. The complaint says one officer held Floyd's back and another held his legs, while Chauvin put his knee on Floyd's head and neck area. When one officer said he was getting worried and asked if Floyd should be rolled onto his side, Chauvin said no. In all, Chauvin had his knee on Floyd's neck for eight minutes and 46 seconds. The complaint says that includes nearly three minutes after Floyd stopped moving and talking. Chauvin's attorney had no comment when reached by The Associated Press. ___ 3:45 p.m. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey has declared a nighttime curfew running from 8 p.m. Friday to 6 a.m. Saturday and again from 8 p.m. Saturday through 6 a.m. Sunday. His order comes after sometimes violent protests over the death of George Floyd. The handcuffed black man pleaded for air as a white police officer knelt on his neck. Frey's order said nobody may venture out in public during those times, except for emergency responders, or people seeking medical care, fleeing dangerous circumstances or experiencing homelessness. Violators can be fined up to $1,000 and jailed up to 90 days. ___ 2:20 p.m. U.S. Attorney General William Barr says he's 'confident justice will be served' after the restraint death of a black man in Minneapolis police custody. Barr said in a statement Friday that the videos of George Floyd's death were 'harrowing to watch and deeply disturbing.' The Justice Department and FBI are conducting an investigation to determine whether federal civil rights laws were broken. Barr's comments come as the white police officer who was seen on video kneeling on Floyd's neck was arrested. Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman said Derek Chauvin was charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. Barr says a decision whether to pursue federal charges 'must be, and will be, based on the law and facts' and that the process is 'proceeding quickly.' He said federal officials were working with local law enforcement to ensure relevant evidence is collected as quickly as possible. ___ 1:45 p.m. An uncle of a black man who died in police custody in Minneapolis said he will be attending peaceful demonstrations, but that violent protests are 'absolutely outlandish.' Selwyn Jones' nephew George Floyd died Monday after a white officer knelt on his neck as Floyd pleaded for air. Floyd's death has set off days of protests in the Minneapolis area and communities across the U.S. 'I think that is absolutely outlandish for them to destroy their own city, their own home, to make a point,' Jones told the Rapid City Journal in South Dakota. 'I don't think the point that they're trying to make is the point that we're trying to make.' Jones is planning to attend a walk in memory of Floyd on Saturday in Rapid City. He said people who have reacted with violent protest and looting are 'taking advantage of a bad situation to express anger.' ___ 1:30 p.m. Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden says he has spoken with the family of George Floyd and is calling for justice. Biden's comments came as a Minnesota prosecutor announced charges against a police officer seen kneeling on Floyd's neck. Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman says Derek Chauvin is charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter in the restraint death of Floyd. In a brief online appearance Friday, the former vice president blamed systemic racism, which he called 'an open wound' on American society, for Floyd's death. He says it's time for deep and lasting police reform. Biden also took an indirect swipe at President Donald Trump without naming him, saying it was, 'No time for incendiary tweets. No time to incite violence.' ___ 1:15 p.m. A Minnesota prosecutor has charged a police officer with third-degree murder and manslaughter in the restraint death of George Floyd. Floyd is the handcuffed black man whose cries of 'I can't breathe' in a widely seen cellphone video set off days of violent protest in Minneapolis and around the country. Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman said Friday that he may yet bring more charges against the officer, Derek Chauvin. The white officer knelt on Floyd's neck for at least eight minutes in the video. Floyd can be seen gradually becoming motionless as Chauvin and three other officers ignored bystanders' shouts to get off him. Floyd was pronounced dead at a Minneapolis hospital in an incident that began when police responded to a report of a man passing a counterfeit bill in a grocery store on Memorial Day. The charges came after Minneapolis has been rocked by three days of protests, including looting, scores of fires and the burning of a police precinct station on Thursday even after the governor called out the National Guard. ___ 12:45 p.m. Russia's Foreign Ministry is responding to the death of George Floyd. The ministry says in a lengthy statement that the death underlines frequent violence by police in the United States. Floyd pleaded for air as a white police officer knelt on the handcuffed black man's neck. The officer, Derek Chauvin, was arrested Friday. The statement from the Russian Foreign Ministry says, 'This incident is far from the first in a series of manifestations of lawlessness and unjustified violence by the 'law enforcement officers' in the United States."" The ministry called on the U.S. to 'to take real and effective measures to rectify the situation, return to the conscientious fulfillment of international obligations, and bring national legislation in line with the basic UN principles on the use of force and firearms by law enforcement agencies."" ___ 12:25 p.m. Minnesota authorities say the police officer who knelt on George Floyd has been arrested. Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington said Friday that state investigators arrested Derek Chauvin. Chauvin is the white officer who was seen on video kneeling on the neck of Floyd, a handcuffed black man. The arrest comes after three days of protests, which escalated in violence as demonstrators torched a police precinct that had been abandoned by officers. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz on Friday acknowledged the 'abject failure' of the response to this week's violent protests. Walz said the state would take over the response and that it's time to show respect and dignity to those who are suffering. ___ 12:05 p.m. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz is acknowledging the 'abject failure' of the response to this week's protests over the death of George Floyd. During a news conference on Friday, Walz said the state would take over the response. He says it's time to show respect and dignity to those who are suffering. He also called for swift justice for officers involved in Floyd's death. The handcuffed black man pleaded for air as a white officer knelt on his neck. Walz's comments came after protesters torched a police station that officers abandoned during a third night of violence. Livestream video showed protesters entering the building, where intentionally set fires activated smoke alarms and sprinklers. ___ 11:30 a.m. Attorneys for the families of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor are calling for an independent investigation of the actions leading to Floyd's death. They also want national reforms in response to the three deaths. Attorney Benjamin Crump said during a news conference Friday that he's asked to take custody of Floyd's body for an independent autopsy. He and attorney Lee Merritt said they want murder charges brought against the four Minneapolis police officers involved in Floyd's arrest. And they want the Minnesota attorney general to take over the investigation. Crump says the families from Georgia, Kentucky and now Minnesota have all had to dispel narratives from law enforcement that their loved ones 'brought this upon themselves.' They cited an initial report in Floyd's case that said he threatened police and died of a medical condition. Videos show an officer kneeling on the back of Floyd's neck as the handcuffed black man pleads for air. The attorneys said they'll seek national legislation seeking better training and to lower the burden to charge officers for excessive force. ___ 11 a.m. A now-fired police officer and a black man who died in his custody both worked as security guards at a popular Latin nightclub as recently as the end of last year.

Jackson, like Floyd, is from Houston and they were friends. The handcuffed black man died after pleading for air as a white Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck. That officer, Derek Chauvin, was arrested Friday and charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. The charges were announced shortly after Jackson spoke at a news conference organized by activists at Minneapolis City Hall. Actor Jamie Foxx and Minnesota Timberwolves star Karl-Anthony Towns were among those in attendance. Jackson is 42. He played for eight NBA teams from 2000-2013 and won a championship in 2003 with the San Antonio Spurs. He and Floyd called each other 'twin' because of their resemblance. Both were star high school athletes in the Houston area in the 1990s. Floyd had moved to Minneapolis two years ago for a fresh start. ___ 4 p.m. A white Minneapolis police officer who is charged with murder for kneeling on George Floyd's neck as he pleaded for air is accused of ignoring another officer who was worried that the handcuffed black man should be rolled onto his side. Derek Chauvin, 44, was charged Friday with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. The criminal complaint also says that an autopsy revealed nothing to support strangulation. It says the medical examiner concluded that the combined effects of being restrained, potential intoxicants in Floyd's system, and his underlying health issues likely contributed to his death. The complaint says Floyd was struggling with officers who tried to put him in a squad car and at one point he went to the ground face down. The complaint says one officer held Floyd's back and another held his legs, while Chauvin put his knee on Floyd's head and neck area. When one officer said he was getting worried and asked if Floyd should be rolled onto his side, Chauvin said no. In all, Chauvin had his knee on Floyd's neck for eight minutes and 46 seconds. The complaint says that includes nearly three minutes after Floyd stopped moving and talking. Chauvin's attorney had no comment when reached by The Associated Press. ___ 3:45 p.m. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey has declared a nighttime curfew running from 8 p.m. Friday to 6 a.m. Saturday and again from 8 p.m. Saturday through 6 a.m. Sunday. His order comes after sometimes violent protests over the death of George Floyd. The handcuffed black man pleaded for air as a white police officer knelt on his neck. Frey's order said nobody may venture out in public during those times, except for emergency responders, or people seeking medical care, fleeing dangerous circumstances or experiencing homelessness. Violators can be fined up to $1,000 and jailed up to 90 days. ___ 2:20 p.m. U.S. Attorney General William Barr says he's 'confident justice will be served' after the restraint death of a black man in Minneapolis police custody. Barr said in a statement Friday that the videos of George Floyd's death were 'harrowing to watch and deeply disturbing.' The Justice Department and FBI are conducting an investigation to determine whether federal civil rights laws were broken. Barr's comments come as the white police officer who was seen on video kneeling on Floyd's neck was arrested. Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman said Derek Chauvin was charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. Barr says a decision whether to pursue federal charges 'must be, and will be, based on the law and facts' and that the process is 'proceeding quickly.' He said federal officials were working with local law enforcement to ensure relevant evidence is collected as quickly as possible. ___ 1:45 p.m. An uncle of a black man who died in police custody in Minneapolis said he will be attending peaceful demonstrations, but that violent protests are 'absolutely outlandish.' Selwyn Jones' nephew George Floyd died Monday after a white officer knelt on his neck as Floyd pleaded for air. Floyd's death has set off days of protests in the Minneapolis area and communities across the U.S. 'I think that is absolutely outlandish for them to destroy their own city, their own home, to make a point,' Jones told the Rapid City Journal in South Dakota. 'I don't think the point that they're trying to make is the point that we're trying to make.' Jones is planning to attend a walk in memory of Floyd on Saturday in Rapid City. He said people who have reacted with violent protest and looting are 'taking advantage of a bad situation to express anger.' ___ 1:30 p.m. Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden says he has spoken with the family of George Floyd and is calling for justice. Biden's comments came as a Minnesota prosecutor announced charges against a police officer seen kneeling on Floyd's neck. Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman says Derek Chauvin is charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter in the restraint death of Floyd. In a brief online appearance Friday, the former vice president blamed systemic racism, which he called 'an open wound' on American society, for Floyd's death. He says it's time for deep and lasting police reform. Biden also took an indirect swipe at President Donald Trump without naming him, saying it was, 'No time for incendiary tweets. No time to incite violence.' ___ 1:15 p.m. A Minnesota prosecutor has charged a police officer with third-degree murder and manslaughter in the restraint death of George Floyd. Floyd is the handcuffed black man whose cries of 'I can't breathe' in a widely seen cellphone video set off days of violent protest in Minneapolis and around the country. Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman said Friday that he may yet bring more charges against the officer, Derek Chauvin. The white officer knelt on Floyd's neck for at least eight minutes in the video. Floyd can be seen gradually becoming motionless as Chauvin and three other officers ignored bystanders' shouts to get off him. Floyd was pronounced dead at a Minneapolis hospital in an incident that began when police responded to a report of a man passing a counterfeit bill in a grocery store on Memorial Day. The charges came after Minneapolis has been rocked by three days of protests, including looting, scores of fires and the burning of a police precinct station on Thursday even after the governor called out the National Guard. ___ 12:45 p.m. Russia's Foreign Ministry is responding to the death of George Floyd. The ministry says in a lengthy statement that the death underlines frequent violence by police in the United States. Floyd pleaded for air as a white police officer knelt on the handcuffed black man's neck. The officer, Derek Chauvin, was arrested Friday. The statement from the Russian Foreign Ministry says, 'This incident is far from the first in a series of manifestations of lawlessness and unjustified violence by the 'law enforcement officers' in the United States."" The ministry called on the U.S. to 'to take real and effective measures to rectify the situation, return to the conscientious fulfillment of international obligations, and bring national legislation in line with the basic UN principles on the use of force and firearms by law enforcement agencies."" ___ 12:25 p.m. Minnesota authorities say the police officer who knelt on George Floyd has been arrested. Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington said Friday that state investigators arrested Derek Chauvin. Chauvin is the white officer who was seen on video kneeling on the neck of Floyd, a handcuffed black man. The arrest comes after three days of protests, which escalated in violence as demonstrators torched a police precinct that had been abandoned by officers. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz on Friday acknowledged the 'abject failure' of the response to this week's violent protests. Walz said the state would take over the response and that it's time to show respect and dignity to those who are suffering. ___ 12:05 p.m. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz is acknowledging the 'abject failure' of the response to this week's protests over the death of George Floyd. During a news conference on Friday, Walz said the state would take over the response. He says it's time to show respect and dignity to those who are suffering. He also called for swift justice for officers involved in Floyd's death. The handcuffed black man pleaded for air as a white officer knelt on his neck. Walz's comments came after protesters torched a police station that officers abandoned during a third night of violence. Livestream video showed protesters entering the building, where intentionally set fires activated smoke alarms and sprinklers. ___ 11:30 a.m. Attorneys for the families of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor are calling for an independent investigation of the actions leading to Floyd's death. They also want national reforms in response to the three deaths. Attorney Benjamin Crump said during a news conference Friday that he's asked to take custody of Floyd's body for an independent autopsy. He and attorney Lee Merritt said they want murder charges brought against the four Minneapolis police officers involved in Floyd's arrest. And they want the Minnesota attorney general to take over the investigation. Crump says the families from Georgia, Kentucky and now Minnesota have all had to dispel narratives from law enforcement that their loved ones 'brought this upon themselves.' They cited an initial report in Floyd's case that said he threatened police and died of a medical condition. Videos show an officer kneeling on the back of Floyd's neck as the handcuffed black man pleads for air. The attorneys said they'll seek national legislation seeking better training and to lower the burden to charge officers for excessive force. ___ 11 a.m. A now-fired police officer and a black man who died in his custody both worked as security guards at a popular Latin nightclub as recently as the end of last year. But the club's former owner says it's not clear whether they knew each other. Officer Derek Chauvin worked at the El Nuevo Rodeo club as off-duty security for nearly two decades.

(WPRI) — The impact of the deadly arrest of George Floyd in Minneapolis is being felt nationwide, including here in Rhode Island. Floyd died in police custody after an officer kneeled on his neck while he was handcuffed and pleading that he couldn’t breathe. The entire incident was captured on video and has sparked violent protests across the country. During her daily coronavirus briefing, Gov. Gina Raimondo called the video “hard to watch.” “It’s such a wake-up call to everyone that we have a long way to go in this country to put a lid on racism and discrimination of any kind,” Raimondo said. “My own personal view is it’s a wake-up call for all of us in whatever walk of life we’re in. If you are a governor, you can do certain things. If you are just a citizen, you do other things. It’s on you to do what you can to stop discrimination and racism in all of its very ugly forms.” In a joint statement, Providence Police Col. Hugh Clements and Public Safety Commissioner Steven Paré called the incident “an inappropriate and excess use of force.” “The Providence Police Department further condemns the kneeling on the neck or throat as a proper use of force tactic,” the statement says. “This tactic is not part of our training and we constantly review our policies and practices as it relates to use of force to ensure that these tactics are never used by the Providence Police Department.” Providence Mayor Jorge Elorza said Floyd’s death “is unacceptable and a call for us to take a hard look at the institutional racism in this country.” “No one should ever fear for their life when interacting with the police,” he said in a statement. “My heart goes out to the Floyd family and to the many others who suffered similar injustices and should be alive, with us today.” Sherrod Jones, a community advocate and pastor at Judah Multicultural Church in Providence, said the only way to begin to heal the wounds of the African American community is through justice for Floyd. Some of that justice was served Friday afternoon when Derek Chauvin, the officer who held his knee on Floyd’s neck, was arrested and charged with murder. He was one of four officers fired after video of the incident surfaced. There are two rallies reportedly planned in Providence this weekend connected to Floyd’s death. Jones said he hopes they remain peaceful, unlike recent protests. “We can’t be heard when we are burning down buildings and looting,” Jones said, referencing the burning of the Minneapolis Third Precinct early Friday morning, which is just blocks away from where the incident took place. President Donald Trump tweeted his response to the riots overnight, calling the protesters thugs and implying that they would be shot by members of the National Guard if control wasn’t established. “These THUGS are dishonoring the memory of George Floyd, and I won’t let that happen,” Trump tweeted. “Just spoke to Governor Tim Walz and told him that the Military is with him all the way. Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts. Thank you!” Trump’s comment evoked the civil-rights era by borrowing a phrase used in 1967 by Miami’s police chief to warn of an aggressive police response to unrest in black neighborhoods. Twitter later flagged the tweet for glorifying violence but did not remove it completely after determining it was in the public’s best interest to keep it accessible. Sen. Jack Reed released a statement regarding Trump’s reaction to the overnight protests, saying now is the time for him to “acknowledge that people are hurting, change is needed and this type of incident must never happen again.” “To truly serve justice we must combat systemic racism and inequality. America has real issues it needs to confront with more than slogans or staying in our comfort zones,” Reed said in a statement. “This is a time for unity, resolve, and action; not violence, inflammatory tweets, and name-calling.”",0.0

1620540047,2020-05-29 18:27:30,Minneapolis protest misinformation stokes racial tensions,https://www.providencejournal.com/ZZ/news/20200529/minneapolis-protest-misinformation-stokes-racial-tensions?rssfeed=true,en,True,,68874,providencejournal.com,http://www.providencejournal.com/#spider,"CHICAGO (AP) "" The false social media posts started just hours after protesters first began chanting and carrying banners around the Minneapolis neighborhood where George Floyd, an African American man, died handcuffed in police custody. 'The cop who killed George Floyd,' Facebook and Twitter users claimed, wrongly identifying a man pictured laughing alongside President Donald Trump at a rally as former Minneapolis Police Officer Derek Chauvin. More fake videos and photos followed as the demonstrations turned violent the next day. Some speculated, without evidence, that Floyd's death was staged or that protesters had been paid to stir up trouble, in tweets collectively shared thousands of times. Others said a video showed a protester driving a car through a shopping complex in Minneapolis, when in fact the footage was taken during an incident at an Illinois mall last year. Since a video of an officer kneeling on Floyd's neck first surfaced, internet troublemakers and even celebrities have posted misleading or unsubstantiated claims around his death and the ensuing protests.

1620555634,2020-05-29 18:10:35,Biden ally sees Klobuchar as less likely Biden running mate,https://www.newportri.com/ZZ/news/20200529/biden-ally-sees-klobuchar-as-less-likely-biden-running-mate?rssfeed=true,en,True,,653261,Mercury - United States - Rhode Island,http://www.newportmercury.com/,"WASHINGTON (AP) "" Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar seems a less likely choice to become Joe Biden's running mate on his presidential ticket following this week's death of a black man in police custody in Minneapolis, a key ally of the former vice president said. Rep. James Clyburn, D-S.C., told reporters on Friday that while he believes Klobuchar is 'absolutely' qualified to be vice president, 'This is very tough timing for her.' Klobuchar was a prosecutor years ago in the county that includes Minneapolis. During that period, more than two dozen people "" mostly minorities "" died during encounters with police. Following customary practice at the time, she sent the cases to grand juries, which brought no criminal charges against any of the officers involved. Clyburn, who called his view a 'gut feeling,' played a pivotal role in helping Biden become the Democratic Party's all-but-certain presidential nominee. Clyburn is the No. 3 House Democratic leader and Congress' highest-ranking black lawmaker. 'So often in politics, timing really dictates things. Barack Obama I don't think could have gotten elected four years before he got elected,"" Clyburn said of the former president during a conference call. 'And I don't know whether he could get elected today.' Clyburn helped revive Biden's badly flagging presidential campaign earlier this year, lifting him to a decisive win in a South Carolina primary in which large numbers of voters were black. That fueled a Biden run to a string of victories in other state contests that resulted in his becoming the party's presumptive nominee. On MSNBC, Biden said the tensions in Minnesota following the death of George Floyd have 'nothing to do with my running mate.' Pressed on whether Floyd's killing increases pressure to place an African American woman on his ticket, Biden said he's talked about putting women of color on the Supreme Court and in his Cabinet. 'And I also already said that there are women of color under consideration,"" he said. Klobuchar did not respond to a request Friday by The Associated Press for an interview. On CNN, she sidestepped a question about her vice presidential prospects. 'He's going to make the best decision on whoever he wants to govern with,' she said of Biden. Before being elected to the Senate in 2006, Klobuchar, who is white, spent eight years as prosecutor for Minnesota's largest county. Most of the more than two dozen people who died during police encounters in her tenure were people of color, according to data compiled by Communities United Against Police Brutality and news articles reviewed by the AP. An officer involved in one of those past fatal incidents was Derek Chauvin, who was arrested and charged Friday in this week's death of Floyd. A video showing Floyd complaining that he could not breathe as Chauvin kneeled on his neck has helped spark unrest in cities around the country. Chauvin was among six officers who fired on and killed a man in 2006 who reportedly stabbed two people and then aimed a shotgun at police. Chauvin's 2006 case went to the grand jury after Klobuchar was elected to the Senate and had left the county attorney's office. Mike Freeman, Klobuchar's successor as prosecutor, made 'all prosecutorial decisions"" about Chauvin, according to a Freeman statement that Klobuchar's office provided Saturday. Klobuchar told MSNBC that she now believes the practice of asking a grand jury to decide whether to charge officers was wrong. Klobuchar and 27 other Democratic senators wrote Friday to the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division, asking it to investigate 'patterns and practices of racially discriminatory and violent policing' by the Minneapolis police. ___ AP reporters Sara Burnett in Chicago and Will Weissert in Washington contributed to this report.",0.0

Rourke, an African-American woman challenging Senate Majority Leader Mike McCaffrey this November, said the comments came from eight people watching the town hall and were sent repeatedly throughout the forum. She said she was frustrated she spent most of her time reading racist expletives than answering political questions, and while the messages upset Rourke, one message, in particular, left her speechless. “Get Lynched, and then lynched, lynched, lynched,” Rourke said. “I have never in my life had anyone ever say that to me and they did.” The racist comments come as the nation grapples with the deadly arrest of George Floyd, an African-American man who died in police custody after a Minneapolis officer kneeled on his neck. That officer has since been fired and charged with murder. Floyd’s death has sparked outrage across the country, leading to violent protests in Minneapolis and beyond. Rourke said simply discussing racism isn’t enough, and more has to be done. “We do the peaceful protests people complain and when there are the angry protests people complain,” she said. “What are we going to do to make sure that we don’t need to protest anymore?” During her daily coronavirus briefing, Gov. Gina Raimondo was asked about the racist comments directed at Rourke. She had one message for those eight viewers. “Stop it, it is wrong and none of us can tolerate it,” she said. Rourke hopes that speaking out will make others realize that racism exists everywhere, including in Rhode Island. “I need you to understand that I get treated differently because of the way my skin is,” Rourke said. “I don’t have the privilege, you have the privilege and I need you to use your privilege to uplift people like me.”",0.0

(AP Photo/Alex Brandon) WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump spent Friday walking back his post-midnight “thugs” tweet about Minneapolis protesters that added to outrage over the police killing of a black man. Trump’s later repeated condemnation of the killing and outreach to the man’s family was a marked change in tone from his earlier comments that also invoked a civil-rights-era phrase fraught with racist overtones. “When the looting starts, the shooting starts,” Trump had written in a tweet that was quickly flagged by Twitter as violating rules against “glorifying violence.” Trump later said his comments had been misconstrued. “Frankly it means when there’s looting, people get shot and they die,” he said. Trump’s whiplash comments came after protesters torched a Minneapolis police station on Thursday night, capping three days of searing demonstrations over the death of George Floyd, who was captured on video pleading for air as a white police officer knelt on his neck for over eight minutes. And they underscored Trump’s complicated relationship with race as he tries to maintain a law-and-order mantle while looking to appeal to black voters during an election year. They also highlighted his refusal to avoid controversy or cede the spotlight even as the battered nation tries to make sense of another killing and reels over the mounting COVID-19 death toll. Trump, in his tweets, borrowed a phrase once used by former Miami Police Chief Walter Headley in a 1967 speech outlining his department’s efforts to “combat young hoodlums who have taken advantage of the civil rights campaign.” In the speech, Headley said his department had been successful “because I’ve let the word filter down that when the looting starts, the shooting starts.” “We don’t mind being accused of police brutality,” he said in the same speech, according to news reports from the time. Trump, after hours of backlash, said Friday evening that he was unaware of the origins of the phrase. “But I’ve heard it for a long time, as most people have. And frankly it means when there’s looting, people get shot and they die,” he said. Trump also revealed that he had been in touch with Floyd’s family as he continued to denounce the circumstances of the man’s killing, which he called “a terrible insult to police and to policemen.” “I just expressed my sorrow,” Trump told reporters. “He was in tremendous pain, obviously, and couldn’t breathe. And it was very obvious to anybody that watched it.” Still, Trump called on protesters to keep their demonstrations peaceful. “The family of George is entitled to justice, and the people of Minnesota are entitled to live in safety,” he said. “Law and order will prevail.” Criticism of the Trump’s tweet had been swift, with his presumptive Democratic presidential rival Joe Biden saying it was “no time for incendiary tweets, no time to incite violence.” “It’s not helpful,” said Minnesota’s Democratic Gov. Tim Walz. “Anything we do to add fuel to that fire is really, really challenging.” Rep. Emmanuel Cleaver, D-Mo., said that, as the country passed the grim milestone of more than 100,000 COVID-19 deaths, Trump had missed a chance to help the public cope with “two viruses: One is the coronavirus and the other is the virus of racial animus.” Trump has been accused of stoking racial tensions and exploiting divisions for personal gain since long before he ran for president, beginning with the full-page ads he ran in 1989 calling for the death penalty for the Central Park Five, five young men of color who were wrongly convicted of assaulting a white jogger. Trump — who rarely holds his tongue — has been silent in the face of a long list of high-profile killings by police of black men, including Eric Garner, who was placed in a chokehold and whose dying words, “I can’t breathe,” became a rallying cry for the Black Lives Matter movement. (Trump has instead invoked those words on several occasions to mock political rivals, even bringing his hands to his neck for dramatic effect.) He spent years railing against NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick and other players for kneeling during the National Anthem to protest racial injustice and police brutality. And in one speech he appeared to advocate rougher treatment of people in custody, speaking dismissively of the police practice of shielding the heads of handcuffed suspects as they are being placed in patrol cars. At the same time, Trump and his campaign have tried to make inroads with black Americans, particularly after Biden suggested last week that black voters who support Trump “ain’t black.” A bedrock of the Democratic base, black Americans are unlikely to embrace Trump en masse, but his campaign believes even a marginal shift could make a difference — and send a message to white voters uneasy about the president’s charged rhetoric. Meanwhile, the unrest complicates the Trump campaign’s plans for Minnesota, one of the key swing states he hopes to win in November. Twitter’s decision to flag Trump’s tweet — the second time it has acted this week — came a day after he signed an executive order challenging the social media giant’s protections against lawsuits as he accuses it of stifling conservative voices. The warning label prevented the tweet from being shared or liked, though it could still be viewed by users. The White House, trying to skirt the blockage, reposted the message on its own official Twitter account Friday morning. Twitter quickly flagged that tweet, too, accusing the White House of promoting violence. Supporters of the president balked at the move. Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale accused the media, Biden and other Democrats of “purposefully misrepresenting what the President had said, and showing once again that they are incapable of resisting their base impulse of dividing Americans, solely for the purpose of political gain, ratings, and cable news profit.”",0.0

Meanwhile, the unrest complicates the Trump campaign’s plans for Minnesota, one of the key swing states he hopes to win in November. Twitter’s decision to flag Trump’s tweet — the second time it has acted this week — came a day after he signed an executive order challenging the social media giant’s protections against lawsuits as he accuses it of stifling conservative voices. The warning label prevented the tweet from being shared or liked, though it could still be viewed by users. The White House, trying to skirt the blockage, reposted the message on its own official Twitter account Friday morning. Twitter quickly flagged that tweet, too, accusing the White House of promoting violence. Supporters of the president balked at the move. Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale accused the media, Biden and other Democrats of “purposefully misrepresenting what the President had said, and showing once again that they are incapable of resisting their base impulse of dividing Americans, solely for the purpose of political gain, ratings, and cable news profit.”",0.0

In Phoenix, Denver, Las Vegas, Los Angeles and beyond, thousands of protesters carried signs that said: “He said I can’t breathe. Justice for George.” They chanted ”“No justice, no peace” and “Say his name. George Floyd.” After hours of peaceful protest in downtown Atlanta, some demonstrators suddenly turned violent, smashing police cars, setting one on fire, spray-painting the iconic logo sign at CNN headquarters, and breaking into a restaurant. The crowd pelted officers with bottles, chanting “Quit your jobs.” People watched the scene from rooftops, some laughing as skirmishes broke out. Demonstrators ignored police demands to disperse. Some protesters moved to the city’s major interstate thoroughfare to try to block traffic. Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms passionately addressed the protesters at a news conference: “This is not a protest. This is not in the spirit of Martin Luther King Jr.” “You are disgracing our city,” she told protesters. “You are disgracing the life of George Floyd and every other person who has been killed in this country. We are better than this. We are better than this as a city. We are better than this as a country. Go home, go home.” Bottoms was flanked by rappers T.I. and Killer Mike, as well as the King’s daughter, Bernice King. Killer Mike cried as he spoke. “We have to be better than this moment. We have to be better than burning down our own homes. Because if we lose Atlanta what have we got?” he said. In Brooklyn, crowds of demonstrators chanted at police officers lined up outside the Barclays Center. There were several moments of struggle, as some in the crowd pushed against metal barricades and police pushed back. Scores of water bottles flew from the crowd toward the officers, and in return police sprayed an eye-irritating chemical at the group twice. The names of black people killed by police, including Floyd and Eric Garner, who died on Staten Island in 2014, were on signs carried by those in the crowd, and in their chants. “It’s my duty to be out here,” said Brianna Petrisko, among those at Foley Square in lower Manhattan, where most were wearing masks amid the coronavirus pandemic. “Our country has a sickness. We have to be out here. This is the only way we’re going to be heard.” In Houston, where George Floyd grew up, several thousand people rallied in front of City Hall. Police had apparently taken into custody a woman who had a rifle and had tried to use it to incite the crowd.

Amy Klobuchar seems a less likely choice to become Joe Biden's running mate on his presidential ticket following this week's death of a black man in police custody in Minneapolis, a key ally of the former vice president said. Rep. James Clyburn, D-S.C., told reporters on Friday that while he believes Klobuchar is 'absolutely' qualified to be vice president, 'This is very tough timing for her.' Klobuchar was a prosecutor years ago in the county that includes Minneapolis. During that period, more than two dozen people "" mostly minorities "" died during encounters with police. Following customary practice at the time, she sent the cases to grand juries, which brought no criminal charges against any of the officers involved. Clyburn, who called his view a 'gut feeling,' played a pivotal role in helping Biden become the Democratic Party's all-but-certain presidential nominee. Clyburn is the No. 3 House Democratic leader and Congress' highest-ranking black lawmaker. 'So often in politics, timing really dictates things. Barack Obama I don't think could have gotten elected four years before he got elected,"" Clyburn said of the former president during a conference call. 'And I don't know whether he could get elected today.' Clyburn helped revive Biden's badly flagging presidential campaign earlier this year, lifting him to a decisive win in a South Carolina primary in which large numbers of voters were black. That fueled a Biden run to a string of victories in other state contests that resulted in his becoming the party's presumptive nominee. On MSNBC, Biden said the tensions in Minnesota following the death of George Floyd have 'nothing to do with my running mate.'

On CNN, she sidestepped a question about her vice presidential prospects. 'He's going to make the best decision on whoever he wants to govern with,' she said of Biden. Before being elected to the Senate in 2006, Klobuchar, who is white, spent eight years as prosecutor for Minnesota's largest county. Most of the more than two dozen people who died during police encounters in her tenure were people of color, according to data compiled by Communities United Against Police Brutality and news articles reviewed by the AP. An officer involved in one of those past fatal incidents was Derek Chauvin, who was arrested and charged Friday in this week's death of Floyd.

Chauvin was among six officers who fired on and killed a man in 2006 who reportedly stabbed two people and then aimed a shotgun at police.

Trump's repeated condemnation of the killing and outreach to the man's family was a marked change in tone from his earlier comments that also invoked a civil-rights-era phrase fraught with racist overtones. 'When the looting starts, the shooting starts,' Trump had written in a tweet that was quickly flagged by Twitter as violating rules against 'glorifying violence.' Trump later said his comments had been misconstrued. 'Frankly it means when there's looting, people get shot and they die,' he said. Trump's explanation did little to satisfy hundreds of protesters who gathered outside the White House into early Saturday, shouting 'No justice, no peace' as well as an obscene chant directed at the president. Trump's whiplash comments came after protesters torched a Minneapolis police station on Thursday night, following three days of searing demonstrations over the death of George Floyd, who was captured on video pleading for air as a white police officer knelt on his neck for over eight minutes. And they underscored Trump's complicated relationship with race as he tries to maintain a law-and-order mantle while looking to appeal to black voters during an election year. They also highlighted his refusal to avoid controversy or cede the spotlight even as the battered nation tries to make sense of another killing and reels over the mounting COVID-19 death toll. Trump, in his tweets, borrowed a phrase once used by former Miami Police Chief Walter Headley in a 1967 speech outlining his department's efforts to 'combat young hoodlums who have taken advantage of the civil rights campaign.' In the speech, Headley said his department had been successful 'because I've let the word filter down that when the looting starts, the shooting starts."" 'We don't mind being accused of police brutality,' he said in the same speech, according to news reports from the time. Trump, after hours of backlash, said Friday evening that he was unaware of the origins of the phrase. 'But I've heard it for a long time, as most people have. And frankly it means when there's looting, people get shot and they die,' he said. Trump also revealed that he had been in touch with Floyd's family as he continued to denounce the circumstances of the man's killing, which he called 'a terrible insult to police and to policemen.' 'I just expressed my sorrow,' Trump told reporters. 'He was in tremendous pain, obviously, and couldn't breathe. And it was very obvious to anybody that watched it."" Still, Trump called on protesters to keep their demonstrations peaceful. 'The family of George is entitled to justice, and the people of Minnesota are entitled to live in safety,"" he said. 'Law and order will prevail."" Criticism of the Trump's tweet had been swift, with his presumptive Democratic presidential rival Joe Biden saying it was 'no time for incendiary tweets, no time to incite violence.' 'It's not helpful,"" said Minnesota's Democratic Gov. Tim Walz. 'Anything we do to add fuel to that fire is really, really challenging.' Rep. Emmanuel Cleaver, D-Mo., said that, as the country passed the grim milestone of more than 100,000 COVID-19 deaths, Trump had missed a chance to help the public cope with 'two viruses: One is the coronavirus and the other is the virus of racial animus.' Trump has been accused of stoking racial tensions and exploiting divisions for personal gain since long before he ran for president, beginning with the full-page ads he ran in 1989 calling for the death penalty for the Central Park Five, five young men of color who were wrongly convicted of assaulting a white jogger. Trump "" who rarely holds his tongue "" has been silent in the face of a long list of high-profile killings by police of black men, including Eric Garner, who was placed in a chokehold and whose dying words, 'I can't breathe,' became a rallying cry for the Black Lives Matter movement. (Trump has instead invoked those words on several occasions to mock political rivals, even bringing his hands to his neck for dramatic effect.) He spent years railing against NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick and other players for kneeling during the National Anthem to protest racial injustice and police brutality. And in one speech he appeared to advocate rougher treatment of people in custody, speaking dismissively of the police practice of shielding the heads of handcuffed suspects as they are being placed in patrol cars. At the same time, Trump and his campaign have tried to make inroads with black Americans, particularly after Biden suggested last week that black voters who support Trump 'ain't black.' A bedrock of the Democratic base, black Americans are unlikely to embrace Trump en masse, but his campaign believes even a marginal shift could make a difference "" and send a message to white voters uneasy about the president's charged rhetoric. Meanwhile, the unrest complicates the Trump campaign's plans for Minnesota, one of the key swing states he hopes to win in November. Twitter's decision to flag Trump's tweet "" the second time it has acted this week "" came a day after he signed an executive order challenging the social media giant's protections against lawsuits as he accuses it of stifling conservative voices. The warning label prevented the tweet from being shared or liked, though it could still be viewed by users.

He drew an implicit contrast with President Donald Trump, who has suggested authorities could respond with violence to the protests that followed George Floyd's death. 'The original sin of this country still stains our nation today,' Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, said in remarks broadcast from his home in Wilmington, Delaware. ""It's time for us to take a hard look at uncomfortable truths.' Biden announced his bid for the presidency last year arguing he's uniquely positioned to unite a deeply divided country. He pointed to Trump's response to a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, as unworthy of America's people and values. As the country endures another spasm of racial unrest, the central premise of Biden's campaign is being tested. Biden is responding by positioning himself as an empathetic counter to Trump, who often struggles to convey emotion or connect on a personal level during moments of crisis. Biden said he spoke with Floyd's family and demanded justice for his death while calling for 'real police reform that holds all cops up to the high standards that so many of them actually meet.' The president later said that he, too, had spoken with Floyd's family and called them 'terrific people.' Trump initially condemned police actions in Floyd's death but later agitated the unrest by tweeting that protesters could be met with violent police resistance. He threatened to take action to bring Minneapolis 'under control,' called violent protesters outraged by the killing 'thugs' and revived a civil-rights-era phrase fraught with racist overtones. 'When the looting starts, the shooting starts,' Trump wrote in a tweet that was flagged by Twitter as violating rules against 'glorifying violence.' The White House said the president 'did not glorify violence. He clearly condemned it.' By Friday afternoon, Trump sought to acknowledge the shocking circumstances of Floyd's death while commending law enforcement. 'He was in tremendous pain, obviously, and couldn't breathe,' the president said of Floyd. 'It was a very, very sad thing for me to see it. We also know that most policemen, you see the great job they do."" Biden, without mentioning Trump by name, made clear he would approach the presidency differently. 'This is no time for incendiary tweets. This is no time to encourage violence,' Biden said. 'This is a national crisis, and we need real leadership right now. Leadership that will bring everyone to the table so we can take measures to root out systemic racism.' Later appearing on PBS, Biden pointed more openly at Trump: 'I think this president has stoked racism.' Rep. Val Demings, a Florida Democrat considered a potential Biden running mate, criticized Trump's response. 'America is on fire,' she said in an interview Friday. 'And this president is standing there with gasoline. He is dangerous. He's destructive, he's dangerous and he can't even rise to this occasion.' Amid the outrage, Biden tried to make the rest of the country feel what it was like to be African American in modern U.S. society. 'Every day, African Americans go about their lives with constant anxiety and trauma, wondering who will be next,' he said, adding, 'the anger and the frustration and the exhaustion "" it's undeniable.' Biden must go beyond establishing himself as a calming alternative to the president and demonstrate that he will take action that spurs the unity he's promised. It's a feat he may have to accomplish in a hurry if he wants to inspire African Americans to turn out for him in November. The task is especially critical after Biden suggested last week that African American voters who were still undecided between him and Trump 'ain't black,' a comment that some black leaders said were interpreted as taking their votes for granted. Biden quickly said he regretted the comment. NAACP President Derrick Johnson said he believes the nation is in chaos because of a lack of leadership in the White House. But he said change will only come by putting people in positions of power who will be willing to boldly address the needs of affected communities. 'I think the real question is, what are people going to do about it and how are those who are in positions of authority, and those who are seeking positions of authority, how are they going to lay out a plan moving forward?' Johnson said. 'It's about what is the collective will of this society to address the systemic deficits that we all know so well but lack the political will to address.' Moments of acute racial tension have afforded platforms for leadership from presidential candidates in the past. Robert F. Kennedy was seeking the White House in April 1968 and arriving in Indianapolis when he learned that Martin Luther King Jr. had been shot and killed. Kennedy stood on a flatbed truck and spoke about the country having to move past the terrible moments of racial strife "" comments later credited with preventing unrest. Kennedy was assassinated two months later. Black Lives Matter co-founder Alicia Garza said Biden needs to use this moment to connect further with black people and create a more robust black agenda that specifically tackles the need for policing reform and more. 'Black people cannot wait for an agenda that speaks to how it is that our lives will change under a new administration,' Garza said. 'We currently have a president who is inciting violence against black communities and yet, on the other hand, we have somebody who wants to lead this country that needs to go further in their plans, proposals and their vision for how to make sure that we deal with the state of emergency that black communities are facing.' 'It is not enough to engage in politics as usual,' Garza added, 'and expect results, as usual.' ___ Stafford reported from Detroit.

Trump's repeated condemnation of the killing and outreach to the man's family was a marked change in tone from his earlier comments that also invoked a civil-rights-era phrase fraught with racist overtones. 'When the looting starts, the shooting starts,' Trump had written in a tweet that was quickly flagged by Twitter as violating rules against 'glorifying violence.' Trump later said his comments had been misconstrued. 'Frankly it means when there's looting, people get shot and they die,' he said. Trump's explanation did little to satisfy hundreds of protesters who gathered outside the White House into early Saturday, shouting 'No justice, no peace' as well as an obscene chant directed at the president. Trump's whiplash comments came after protesters torched a Minneapolis police station on Thursday night, following three days of searing demonstrations over the death of George Floyd, who was captured on video pleading for air as a white police officer knelt on his neck for over eight minutes. And they underscored Trump's complicated relationship with race as he tries to maintain a law-and-order mantle while looking to appeal to black voters during an election year. They also highlighted his refusal to avoid controversy or cede the spotlight even as the battered nation tries to make sense of another killing and reels over the mounting COVID-19 death toll. Trump, in his tweets, borrowed a phrase once used by former Miami Police Chief Walter Headley in a 1967 speech outlining his department's efforts to 'combat young hoodlums who have taken advantage of the civil rights campaign.' In the speech, Headley said his department had been successful 'because I've let the word filter down that when the looting starts, the shooting starts."" 'We don't mind being accused of police brutality,' he said in the same speech, according to news reports from the time. Trump, after hours of backlash, said Friday evening that he was unaware of the origins of the phrase. 'But I've heard it for a long time, as most people have. And frankly it means when there's looting, people get shot and they die,' he said. Trump also revealed that he had been in touch with Floyd's family as he continued to denounce the circumstances of the man's killing, which he called 'a terrible insult to police and to policemen.' 'I just expressed my sorrow,' Trump told reporters. 'He was in tremendous pain, obviously, and couldn't breathe. And it was very obvious to anybody that watched it."" Still, Trump called on protesters to keep their demonstrations peaceful. 'The family of George is entitled to justice, and the people of Minnesota are entitled to live in safety,"" he said. 'Law and order will prevail."" Criticism of the Trump's tweet had been swift, with his presumptive Democratic presidential rival Joe Biden saying it was 'no time for incendiary tweets, no time to incite violence.' 'It's not helpful,"" said Minnesota's Democratic Gov. Tim Walz. 'Anything we do to add fuel to that fire is really, really challenging.' Rep. Emmanuel Cleaver, D-Mo., said that, as the country passed the grim milestone of more than 100,000 COVID-19 deaths, Trump had missed a chance to help the public cope with 'two viruses: One is the coronavirus and the other is the virus of racial animus.' Trump has been accused of stoking racial tensions and exploiting divisions for personal gain since long before he ran for president, beginning with the full-page ads he ran in 1989 calling for the death penalty for the Central Park Five, five young men of color who were wrongly convicted of assaulting a white jogger. Trump "" who rarely holds his tongue "" has been silent in the face of a long list of high-profile killings by police of black men, including Eric Garner, who was placed in a chokehold and whose dying words, 'I can't breathe,' became a rallying cry for the Black Lives Matter movement. (Trump has instead invoked those words on several occasions to mock political rivals, even bringing his hands to his neck for dramatic effect.) He spent years railing against NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick and other players for kneeling during the National Anthem to protest racial injustice and police brutality. And in one speech he appeared to advocate rougher treatment of people in custody, speaking dismissively of the police practice of shielding the heads of handcuffed suspects as they are being placed in patrol cars. At the same time, Trump and his campaign have tried to make inroads with black Americans, particularly after Biden suggested last week that black voters who support Trump 'ain't black.' A bedrock of the Democratic base, black Americans are unlikely to embrace Trump en masse, but his campaign believes even a marginal shift could make a difference "" and send a message to white voters uneasy about the president's charged rhetoric. Meanwhile, the unrest complicates the Trump campaign's plans for Minnesota, one of the key swing states he hopes to win in November. Twitter's decision to flag Trump's tweet "" the second time it has acted this week "" came a day after he signed an executive order challenging the social media giant's protections against lawsuits as he accuses it of stifling conservative voices. The warning label prevented the tweet from being shared or liked, though it could still be viewed by users. The White House, trying to skirt the blockage, reposted the message on its own official Twitter account Friday morning. Twitter quickly flagged that tweet, too, accusing the White House of promoting violence. Supporters of the president balked at the move. Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale accused the media, Biden and other Democrats of 'purposefully misrepresenting what the President had said, and showing once again that they are incapable of resisting their base impulse of dividing Americans, solely for the purpose of political gain, ratings, and cable news profit.'",0.0

National Guard was called in as pockets of violence and vandalism erupted during a second straight night of protests over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis and President Donald Trump's response to it. Hundreds of people converged on the White House and marched along the National Mall, chanting 'Black Lives Matter,' 'I can't breathe' and 'No justice, no peace.' Protesters threw water bottles, traffic cones, scooters, even tear gas cans at police lines. They set fire to a car and a trash bin and smashed windows, including at Bay Atlantic University. 'What are you doing? That's a school,' one man yelled. An American flag hanging at the Export-Import Bank was taken down, burned and replaced with a Black Lives Matter banner. The D.C. demonstration was one of several around the country responding to the death of Floyd, a black man who died in police custody. Trump appeared to cheer on the tougher tactics being used by law enforcement to disperse protesters Saturday night. He commended National Guard troops deployed in Minneapolis, declaring 'No games!' and he also said police in New York City 'must be allowed to do their job!' 'Let New York's Finest be New York's Finest,' Trump said on Twitter after returning to the White House from Florida, where he watched the launch of a SpaceX rocket. He did not talk to reporters upon his return and it was not clear if he could hear the protest over the sound of his helicopter. But for at least part of the flight, televisions on Air Force One were turned to Fox News and its coverage of the protests. Earlier in the day, he had belittled the protesters and pledged to 'stop mob violence.' 'I stand before you as a friend and ally to every American seeking justice and peace, and I stand before you in firm opposition to anyone exploiting this tragedy to loot, rob, attack and menace,' the president said after watching the launch of a SpaceX rocket. 'Healing, not hatred, justice, not chaos, are the missions at hand.' Police were in tactical gear. The D.C. National Guard was activated at the direction of the secretary of the Army and at the request of the Park Police to help maintain order near the White House, Commanding Gen. William J. Walker said in a post on the Guard's Facebook page. 'We're sick of it. The cops are out of control,' protester Olga Hall said. 'They're wild. There's just been too many dead boys,' she said. Some vocal protesters directed their comments at a black police officer. 'Do you support this violence?' they asked him. 'How are you going to protect your kids?' The officer got emotional to the point he had to be relieved. An activist wearing a Black Lives Matter T-shirt put himself between police and the protesters and yelled, 'Stop. This is what they want.' Speaking over a megaphone earlier in the evening, Cameron McCall said, 'We don't need violence. All we need are our voices.' While some protesters stayed near the White House, others marched through the streets chanting, 'No justice and no peace.' and 'Say his name: George Floyd.' The mood was angry and several speakers implored marchers to remain peaceful. The march paused between the the Washington Monument and the National Museum of African American History and Culture. Demonstrators sat down in the street for a moment of silence lasting for the eight minutes or more that the Minneapolis police officer reportedly knelt on Floyd's neck. At the Lincoln Memorial, one organizer spoke over a megaphone. 'Look to the left and to the right and thank that person. We can't hug anybody because of COVID, but I love you anyway.' Many of the protesters wore masks, but did not socially distance themselves. Another group circled through the Capitol Hill neighborhood for at least an hour in cars, honking. A helicopter hovered overhead. In a series of tweets earlier Saturday, Trump doubted protesters' allegiance to Floyd's memory, saying they were 'professionally managed.' He offered no evidence to back his assertion, and the president even seemed to invite supporters to make their presence felt: 'Tonight, I understand, is MAGA NIGHT AT THE WHITE HOUSE???' Trump later rejected the suggestion that he was stoking a potential conflict between protesters and his supporters. 'I was just asking. But I have no idea if they are going to be here,"" he said. 'MAGA is Make America Great Again. By the way, they love African American people. They love black people.' At Saturday's demonstration, there was no evidence of a counter-move by Trump supporters. Trump said he had 'watched every move' from inside the executive mansion during Friday's protest and 'couldn't have felt more safe' as the Secret Service let the protesters carry on, 'but whenever someone ... got too frisky or out of line, they would quickly come down on then, hard "" didn't know what hit them.' The president also criticized the mayors of Washington and Minneapolis. Trump said Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey 'is probably a very good person, but he's a radical, left mayor.' He then described how he watched as a police station in the city was overrun. 'For that police station to be abandoned and taken over, I've never seen anything so horrible and stupid in my life,"" Trump said when speaking briefly to reporters at the White House. He said Minnesota officials have to get tougher with rioters, and that by doing so they would be honoring the memory of Floyd. The Secret Service said in a statement Saturday that six protesters were arrested in Washington and 'multiple' officers were injured. There were no details on the charges or nature of the injuries. A spokesman for U.S. Park Police said their officers made no arrests, but several suffered minor injuries and one was taken to a hospital after being struck in the helmet by a projectile. Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf on Saturday called the protesters 'criminals' who committed 'acts of violence while hiding behind their First Amendment right of lawful protest.' Late Saturday and early Sunday, protesters vented their rage by breaking into tony shops of Georgetown, on the western edge of the District, and in downtown Washington, breaking windows and glass doors of many stores and looting some of them. In his tweeting, Trump claimed that many Secret Service agents were 'just waiting for action' and ready to unleash 'the most vicious dogs, and the most ominous weapons, I have ever seen."" His reference to 'vicious dogs' potentially being sicced on protesters revisits images from the civil rights movement when marchers faced snarling police dogs and high-pressure fire hoses. In a news conference Saturday afternoon, Muriel Bowser, mayor of the nation's capital, called Trump's remarks 'gross' and said the reference to attack dogs conjures up with the worst memories of the nation's fight against segregation. 'I call upon our city and our nation to exercise restraint, great restraint, even as the president tries to divide us,' she said. 'I feel like these comments are an attack on humanity, an attack on black America, and they make my city less safe.' In contrast with the president's tweets, the Secret Service said it 'respects the right to assemble and we ask that individuals do so peacefully for the safety of all.' ___ AP video journalist Nathan Ellgren contributed to this report.",0.0

He drew an implicit contrast with President Donald Trump, who has suggested authorities could respond with violence to the protests that followed George Floyd's death. 'The original sin of this country still stains our nation today,' Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, said in remarks broadcast from his home in Wilmington, Delaware. ""It's time for us to take a hard look at uncomfortable truths.' Biden announced his bid for the presidency last year arguing he's uniquely positioned to unite a deeply divided country. He pointed to Trump's response to a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, as unworthy of America's people and values. As the country endures another spasm of racial unrest, the central premise of Biden's campaign is being tested. Biden is responding by positioning himself as an empathetic counter to Trump, who often struggles to convey emotion or connect on a personal level during moments of crisis. Biden said he spoke with Floyd's family and demanded justice for his death while calling for 'real police reform that holds all cops up to the high standards that so many of them actually meet.' The president later said that he, too, had spoken with Floyd's family and called them 'terrific people.' Trump initially condemned police actions in Floyd's death but later agitated the unrest by tweeting that protesters could be met with violent police resistance. He threatened to take action to bring Minneapolis 'under control,' called violent protesters outraged by the killing 'thugs' and revived a civil-rights-era phrase fraught with racist overtones. 'When the looting starts, the shooting starts,' Trump wrote in a tweet that was flagged by Twitter as violating rules against 'glorifying violence.' The White House said the president 'did not glorify violence. He clearly condemned it.' By Friday afternoon, Trump sought to acknowledge the shocking circumstances of Floyd's death while commending law enforcement. 'He was in tremendous pain, obviously, and couldn't breathe,' the president said of Floyd. 'It was a very, very sad thing for me to see it. We also know that most policemen, you see the great job they do."" Biden, without mentioning Trump by name, made clear he would approach the presidency differently. 'This is no time for incendiary tweets. This is no time to encourage violence,' Biden said. 'This is a national crisis, and we need real leadership right now. Leadership that will bring everyone to the table so we can take measures to root out systemic racism.' Later appearing on PBS, Biden pointed more openly at Trump: 'I think this president has stoked racism.' Rep. Val Demings, a Florida Democrat considered a potential Biden running mate, criticized Trump's response. 'America is on fire,' she said in an interview Friday. 'And this president is standing there with gasoline. He is dangerous. He's destructive, he's dangerous and he can't even rise to this occasion.' Amid the outrage, Biden tried to make the rest of the country feel what it was like to be African American in modern U.S. society. 'Every day, African Americans go about their lives with constant anxiety and trauma, wondering who will be next,' he said, adding, 'the anger and the frustration and the exhaustion "" it's undeniable.' Biden must go beyond establishing himself as a calming alternative to the president and demonstrate that he will take action that spurs the unity he's promised. It's a feat he may have to accomplish in a hurry if he wants to inspire African Americans to turn out for him in November. The task is especially critical after Biden suggested last week that African American voters who were still undecided between him and Trump 'ain't black,' a comment that some black leaders said were interpreted as taking their votes for granted.

At the same time, Trump and his campaign have tried to make inroads with black Americans, particularly after Biden suggested last week that black voters who support Trump 'ain't black.' A bedrock of the Democratic base, black Americans are unlikely to embrace Trump en masse, but his campaign believes even a marginal shift could make a difference "" and send a message to white voters uneasy about the president's charged rhetoric. Meanwhile, the unrest complicates the Trump campaign's plans for Minnesota, one of the key swing states he hopes to win in November. Twitter's decision to flag Trump's tweet "" the second time it has acted this week "" came a day after he signed an executive order challenging the social media giant's protections against lawsuits as he accuses it of stifling conservative voices. The warning label prevented the tweet from being shared or liked, though it could still be viewed by users. The White House, trying to skirt the blockage, reposted the message on its own official Twitter account Friday morning. Twitter quickly flagged that tweet, too, accusing the White House of promoting violence. Supporters of the president balked at the move. Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale accused the media, Biden and other Democrats of 'purposefully misrepresenting what the President had said, and showing once again that they are incapable of resisting their base impulse of dividing Americans, solely for the purpose of political gain, ratings, and cable news profit.'",0.0

The protests, which began in Minneapolis following Floyd's death Monday after a police officer pressed a knee on his neck until he stopped breathing, have left parts of the city a grid of broken windows, burned-out buildings and ransacked stores. The unrest has since become a national phenomenon as protesters decry years of deaths at police hands. Tens of thousands of people were in the streets across the country, many of them not wearing masks or observing social distancing, raising concerns among health experts about the potential for spreading the coronavirus pandemic at a time when much of the country is in the process of reopening society and the economy. After a tumultuous Friday, racially diverse crowds held mostly peaceful demonstrations in dozens of cities, though many later descended into violence as had happened the previous night. Few corners of America were untouched, from protesters setting fires inside Reno's city hall, to police launching tear gas at rock-throwing demonstrators in Fargo, North Dakota, to shattered windows at police headquarters in Richmond, Virginia. "" In Indianapolis, police were investigating 'multiple shootings' downtown, including one that left a person dead, amid the protests. Police gave few details but said no officers were involved. "" In Washington, the National Guard was deployed outside the White House, where chanting crowds taunted law enforcement officers. Dressed in camouflage and holding shields, the troops stood in a tight line a few yards from the crowd, preventing them from pushing forward. President Donald Trump, who spent much of Saturday in Florida for the SpaceX rocket launch, landed on the lawn in the presidential helicopter at dusk and went inside without speaking to journalists. "" In Philadelphia, at least 13 officers were injured when peaceful protests turned violent and at least four police vehicles were set on fire. Other fires were set throughout downtown. "" In Salt Lake City, protesters defied a curfew and National Guard troops were deployed by Utah's governor. Demonstrators flipped a police car and lit it on fire, and another vehicle was later set ablaze. Police said six people were arrested and a police officer was injured after being struck in the head with a baseball bat. "" In Los Angeles, protesters chanted 'Black Lives Matter,' some within inches of the face shields of officers. Police used batons to move the crowd back and fired rubber bullets. A graffiti-covered police car burned in the street. "" And in New York City, dangerous confrontations flared repeatedly as officers made arrests and cleared streets. A video showed two NYPD cruisers lurching into a crowd of demonstrators who were pushing a barricade against one of them and pelting it with objects. Several people were knocked to the ground, and it was unclear if anyone was hurt. 'The mistakes that are happening are not mistakes. They're repeated violent terrorist offenses and people need to stop killing black people,"" Brooklyn protester Meryl Makielski said. Not all protests devolved into violence. In Juneau, Alaska, law enforcement officers joined elected officials and residents at a peaceful protest in front of a giant whale sculpture on the city's waterfront. 'We don't tolerate excessive use of force,' Juneau Police Chief Ed Mercer told the gathering. Back in Minneapolis, the city where the protests began, police, state troopers and National Guard members moved in soon after an 8 p.m. curfew took effect to break up protests, firing tear gas and rubber bullets to clear streets outside a police precinct and elsewhere. The show of force came after three days when police largely avoided engaging protesters, and after the state poured in more than 4,000 National Guard troops to Minneapolis and said the number would soon rise to nearly 11,000. 'The situation in Minneapolis is no longer in any way about the murder of George Floyd,' said Gov. Tim Walz, who also said local forces had been overmatched the previous day. 'It is about attacking civil society, instilling fear and disrupting our great cities.' Minneapolis' streets steadily grew calmer as the night went on, and Corrections Commissioner Paul Schnell said the tough response would remain as long as it takes to 'quell this situation.' Some residents were glad to see the upheaval dissipating. 'l live here. I haven't been able to sleep,"" said Iman Muhammad, whose neighborhood saw multiple fires set Friday night. Muhammad said she sympathized with peaceful protests over Floyd's death but disagreed with the violence: 'Wrong doesn't answer wrong."" Trump appeared to cheer on the tougher tactics Saturday night, commending the Guard deployment in Minneapolis, declaring 'No games!' and saying police in New York City 'must be allowed to do their job!' Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden condemned the violence as he continued to express common cause with those demonstrating after Floyd's death. 'The act of protesting should never be allowed to overshadow the reason we protest,' Biden said in a statement Saturday night. Overnight curfews were imposed in more than a dozen major cities nationwide, including Atlanta, Denver, Los Angeles, Minneapolis and Seattle. More than 1,300 people have been arrested in 16 cities since Thursday, including over 500 Friday in Los Angeles. The unrest comes at a time when most Americans have spent months inside over concerns surrounding the coronavirus, which the president has called an 'invisible enemy.' The events of the last 72 hours, seen live on national television, have shown the opposite: a sudden pivot to crowds, screaming protesters and burning buildings, and a stark contrast to the empty streets of recent months. 'Quite frankly I'm ready to just lock people up,"" Atlanta Police Chief Erika Shields said at a news conference. Demonstrations there turned violent Friday, and police were arresting protesters Saturday on blocked-off downtown streets. 'Yes, you caught us off balance once. It's not going to happen twice.' This week's unrest recalled the riots in Los Angeles nearly 30 years ago after the acquittal of the white police officers who beat Rodney King, a black motorist who had led them on a high-speed chase. The protests of Floyd's killing have gripped many more cities, but the losses in Minneapolis have yet to approach the staggering totals Los Angeles saw during five days of rioting in 1992, when more than 60 people died, 2,000-plus were injured and thousands arrested, with property damage topping $1 billion. Many protesters spoke of frustration that Floyd's death was one more in a litany. It came in the wake of the killing in Georgia of Ahmaud Arbery, a black man who was shot dead after being pursued by two white men while running in their neighborhood, and in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic that has thrown millions out of work, killed more than 100,000 people in the U.S. and disproportionately affected black people. The officer who held his knee to Floyd's neck as he begged for air was arrested Friday and charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. But many protesters are demanding the arrests of the three other officers involved. Trump stoked the anger on Twitter, saying that if protesters had breached the White House fence, they would 'have been greeted with the most vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons, I have ever seen.' Leaders in many affected cities have voiced outrage over Floyd's killing and expressed sympathy for protesters' concerns. But as the unrest intensified, they spoke of a desperate need to protect their cities and said they would call in reinforcements, despite concerns that could lead to more heavy-handed tactics. Governors in Georgia, Kentucky, Ohio and Texas also activated the National Guard after protests there turned violent. Police in St. Louis were investigating the death of a protester who climbed between two trailers of a Fed Ex truck and was killed when it drove away. And a person was killed in the area of protests in downtown Detroit just before midnight after someone fired shots into an SUV, officers said. Police had initially said someone fired into the crowd from an SUV. ___ Numerous AP journalists contributed from across the U.S.",0.0

He drew an implicit contrast with President Donald Trump, who has suggested authorities could respond with violence to the protests that followed George Floyd's death. 'The original sin of this country still stains our nation today,' Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, said in remarks broadcast from his home in Wilmington, Delaware. ""It's time for us to take a hard look at uncomfortable truths.' Biden announced his bid for the presidency last year arguing he's uniquely positioned to unite a deeply divided country. He pointed to Trump's response to a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, as unworthy of America's people and values. As the country endures another spasm of racial unrest, the central premise of Biden's campaign is being tested. Biden is responding by positioning himself as an empathetic counter to Trump, who often struggles to convey emotion or connect on a personal level during moments of crisis. Biden said he spoke with Floyd's family and demanded justice for his death while calling for 'real police reform that holds all cops up to the high standards that so many of them actually meet.' The president later said that he, too, had spoken with Floyd's family and called them 'terrific people.' Trump initially condemned police actions in Floyd's death but later agitated the unrest by tweeting that protesters could be met with violent police resistance. He threatened to take action to bring Minneapolis 'under control,' called violent protesters outraged by the killing 'thugs' and revived a civil-rights-era phrase fraught with racist overtones. 'When the looting starts, the shooting starts,' Trump wrote in a tweet that was flagged by Twitter as violating rules against 'glorifying violence.' The White House said the president 'did not glorify violence. He clearly condemned it.' By Friday afternoon, Trump sought to acknowledge the shocking circumstances of Floyd's death while commending law enforcement. 'He was in tremendous pain, obviously, and couldn't breathe,' the president said of Floyd. 'It was a very, very sad thing for me to see it. We also know that most policemen, you see the great job they do."" Biden, without mentioning Trump by name, made clear he would approach the presidency differently. 'This is no time for incendiary tweets. This is no time to encourage violence,' Biden said. 'This is a national crisis, and we need real leadership right now. Leadership that will bring everyone to the table so we can take measures to root out systemic racism.' Later appearing on PBS, Biden pointed more openly at Trump: 'I think this president has stoked racism.' Rep. Val Demings, a Florida Democrat considered a potential Biden running mate, criticized Trump's response. 'America is on fire,' she said in an interview Friday. 'And this president is standing there with gasoline. He is dangerous. He's destructive, he's dangerous and he can't even rise to this occasion.' Amid the outrage, Biden tried to make the rest of the country feel what it was like to be African American in modern U.S. society. 'Every day, African Americans go about their lives with constant anxiety and trauma, wondering who will be next,' he said, adding, 'the anger and the frustration and the exhaustion "" it's undeniable.' Biden must go beyond establishing himself as a calming alternative to the president and demonstrate that he will take action that spurs the unity he's promised. It's a feat he may have to accomplish in a hurry if he wants to inspire African Americans to turn out for him in November. The task is especially critical after Biden suggested last week that African American voters who were still undecided between him and Trump 'ain't black,' a comment that some black leaders said were interpreted as taking their votes for granted. Biden quickly said he regretted the comment. NAACP President Derrick Johnson said he believes the nation is in chaos because of a lack of leadership in the White House. But he said change will only come by putting people in positions of power who will be willing to boldly address the needs of affected communities. 'I think the real question is, what are people going to do about it and how are those who are in positions of authority, and those who are seeking positions of authority, how are they going to lay out a plan moving forward?' Johnson said. 'It's about what is the collective will of this society to address the systemic deficits that we all know so well but lack the political will to address.' Moments of acute racial tension have afforded platforms for leadership from presidential candidates in the past. Robert F. Kennedy was seeking the White House in April 1968 and arriving in Indianapolis when he learned that Martin Luther King Jr. had been shot and killed. Kennedy stood on a flatbed truck and spoke about the country having to move past the terrible moments of racial strife "" comments later credited with preventing unrest. Kennedy was assassinated two months later. Black Lives Matter co-founder Alicia Garza said Biden needs to use this moment to connect further with black people and create a more robust black agenda that specifically tackles the need for policing reform and more. 'Black people cannot wait for an agenda that speaks to how it is that our lives will change under a new administration,' Garza said. 'We currently have a president who is inciting violence against black communities and yet, on the other hand, we have somebody who wants to lead this country that needs to go further in their plans, proposals and their vision for how to make sure that we deal with the state of emergency that black communities are facing.' 'It is not enough to engage in politics as usual,' Garza added, 'and expect results, as usual.' ___ Stafford reported from Detroit.

National Guard was called in as pockets of violence and vandalism erupted during a second straight night of protests over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis and President Donald Trump's response to it. Hundreds of people converged on the White House and marched along the National Mall, chanting 'Black Lives Matter,' 'I can't breathe' and 'No justice, no peace.' Protesters threw water bottles, traffic cones, scooters, even tear gas cans at police lines. They set fire to a car and a trash bin and smashed windows, including at Bay Atlantic University. 'What are you doing? That's a school,' one man yelled. An American flag hanging at the Export-Import Bank was taken down, burned and replaced with a Black Lives Matter banner. The D.C. demonstration was one of several around the country responding to the death of Floyd, a black man who died in police custody. Trump appeared to cheer on the tougher tactics being used by law enforcement to disperse protesters Saturday night. He commended National Guard troops deployed in Minneapolis, declaring 'No games!' and he also said police in New York City 'must be allowed to do their job!' 'Let New York's Finest be New York's Finest,' Trump said on Twitter after returning to the White House from Florida, where he watched the launch of a SpaceX rocket. He did not talk to reporters upon his return and it was not clear if he could hear the protest over the sound of his helicopter. But for at least part of the flight, televisions on Air Force One were turned to Fox News and its coverage of the protests. Earlier in the day, he had belittled the protesters and pledged to 'stop mob violence.' 'I stand before you as a friend and ally to every American seeking justice and peace, and I stand before you in firm opposition to anyone exploiting this tragedy to loot, rob, attack and menace,' the president said after watching the launch of a SpaceX rocket. 'Healing, not hatred, justice, not chaos, are the missions at hand.' Police were in tactical gear. The D.C. National Guard was activated at the direction of the secretary of the Army and at the request of the Park Police to help maintain order near the White House, Commanding Gen. William J. Walker said in a post on the Guard's Facebook page. 'We're sick of it. The cops are out of control,' protester Olga Hall said. 'They're wild. There's just been too many dead boys,' she said. Some vocal protesters directed their comments at a black police officer. 'Do you support this violence?' they asked him. 'How are you going to protect your kids?' The officer got emotional to the point he had to be relieved. An activist wearing a Black Lives Matter T-shirt put himself between police and the protesters and yelled, 'Stop. This is what they want.' Speaking over a megaphone earlier in the evening, Cameron McCall said, 'We don't need violence. All we need are our voices.' While some protesters stayed near the White House, others marched through the streets chanting, 'No justice and no peace.' and 'Say his name: George Floyd.' The mood was angry and several speakers implored marchers to remain peaceful. The march paused between the the Washington Monument and the National Museum of African American History and Culture. Demonstrators sat down in the street for a moment of silence lasting for the eight minutes or more that the Minneapolis police officer reportedly knelt on Floyd's neck. At the Lincoln Memorial, one organizer spoke over a megaphone. 'Look to the left and to the right and thank that person. We can't hug anybody because of COVID, but I love you anyway.' Many of the protesters wore masks, but did not socially distance themselves. Another group circled through the Capitol Hill neighborhood for at least an hour in cars, honking. A helicopter hovered overhead. In a series of tweets earlier Saturday, Trump doubted protesters' allegiance to Floyd's memory, saying they were 'professionally managed.' He offered no evidence to back his assertion, and the president even seemed to invite supporters to make their presence felt: 'Tonight, I understand, is MAGA NIGHT AT THE WHITE HOUSE???' Trump later rejected the suggestion that he was stoking a potential conflict between protesters and his supporters. 'I was just asking. But I have no idea if they are going to be here,"" he said. 'MAGA is Make America Great Again. By the way, they love African American people. They love black people.' At Saturday's demonstration, there was no evidence of a counter-move by Trump supporters. Trump said he had 'watched every move' from inside the executive mansion during Friday's protest and 'couldn't have felt more safe' as the Secret Service let the protesters carry on, 'but whenever someone ... got too frisky or out of line, they would quickly come down on then, hard "" didn't know what hit them.' The president also criticized the mayors of Washington and Minneapolis. Trump said Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey 'is probably a very good person, but he's a radical, left mayor.' He then described how he watched as a police station in the city was overrun. 'For that police station to be abandoned and taken over, I've never seen anything so horrible and stupid in my life,"" Trump said when speaking briefly to reporters at the White House. He said Minnesota officials have to get tougher with rioters, and that by doing so they would be honoring the memory of Floyd. The Secret Service said in a statement Saturday that six protesters were arrested in Washington and 'multiple' officers were injured. There were no details on the charges or nature of the injuries. A spokesman for U.S. Park Police said their officers made no arrests, but several suffered minor injuries and one was taken to a hospital after being struck in the helmet by a projectile. Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf on Saturday called the protesters 'criminals' who committed 'acts of violence while hiding behind their First Amendment right of lawful protest.' Late Saturday and early Sunday, protesters vented their rage by breaking into tony shops of Georgetown, on the western edge of the District, and in downtown Washington, breaking windows and glass doors of many stores and looting some of them. In his tweeting, Trump claimed that many Secret Service agents were 'just waiting for action' and ready to unleash 'the most vicious dogs, and the most ominous weapons, I have ever seen."" His reference to 'vicious dogs' potentially being sicced on protesters revisits images from the civil rights movement when marchers faced snarling police dogs and high-pressure fire hoses. In a news conference Saturday afternoon, Muriel Bowser, mayor of the nation's capital, called Trump's remarks 'gross' and said the reference to attack dogs conjures up with the worst memories of the nation's fight against segregation. 'I call upon our city and our nation to exercise restraint, great restraint, even as the president tries to divide us,' she said. 'I feel like these comments are an attack on humanity, an attack on black America, and they make my city less safe.' In contrast with the president's tweets, the Secret Service said it 'respects the right to assemble and we ask that individuals do so peacefully for the safety of all.' ___ AP video journalist Nathan Ellgren contributed to this report.",0.0

Trump's repeated condemnation of the killing and outreach to the man's family was a marked change in tone from his earlier comments that also invoked a civil-rights-era phrase fraught with racist overtones. 'When the looting starts, the shooting starts,' Trump had written in a tweet that was quickly flagged by Twitter as violating rules against 'glorifying violence.' Trump later said his comments had been misconstrued. 'Frankly it means when there's looting, people get shot and they die,' he said. Trump's explanation did little to satisfy hundreds of protesters who gathered outside the White House into early Saturday, shouting 'No justice, no peace' as well as an obscene chant directed at the president. Trump's whiplash comments came after protesters torched a Minneapolis police station on Thursday night, following three days of searing demonstrations over the death of George Floyd, who was captured on video pleading for air as a white police officer knelt on his neck for over eight minutes. And they underscored Trump's complicated relationship with race as he tries to maintain a law-and-order mantle while looking to appeal to black voters during an election year. They also highlighted his refusal to avoid controversy or cede the spotlight even as the battered nation tries to make sense of another killing and reels over the mounting COVID-19 death toll. Trump, in his tweets, borrowed a phrase once used by former Miami Police Chief Walter Headley in a 1967 speech outlining his department's efforts to 'combat young hoodlums who have taken advantage of the civil rights campaign.' In the speech, Headley said his department had been successful 'because I've let the word filter down that when the looting starts, the shooting starts."" 'We don't mind being accused of police brutality,' he said in the same speech, according to news reports from the time. Trump, after hours of backlash, said Friday evening that he was unaware of the origins of the phrase. 'But I've heard it for a long time, as most people have. And frankly it means when there's looting, people get shot and they die,' he said. Trump also revealed that he had been in touch with Floyd's family as he continued to denounce the circumstances of the man's killing, which he called 'a terrible insult to police and to policemen.' 'I just expressed my sorrow,' Trump told reporters. 'He was in tremendous pain, obviously, and couldn't breathe. And it was very obvious to anybody that watched it."" Still, Trump called on protesters to keep their demonstrations peaceful. 'The family of George is entitled to justice, and the people of Minnesota are entitled to live in safety,"" he said. 'Law and order will prevail."" Criticism of the Trump's tweet had been swift, with his presumptive Democratic presidential rival Joe Biden saying it was 'no time for incendiary tweets, no time to incite violence.' 'It's not helpful,"" said Minnesota's Democratic Gov. Tim Walz. 'Anything we do to add fuel to that fire is really, really challenging.' Rep. Emmanuel Cleaver, D-Mo., said that, as the country passed the grim milestone of more than 100,000 COVID-19 deaths, Trump had missed a chance to help the public cope with 'two viruses: One is the coronavirus and the other is the virus of racial animus.' Trump has been accused of stoking racial tensions and exploiting divisions for personal gain since long before he ran for president, beginning with the full-page ads he ran in 1989 calling for the death penalty for the Central Park Five, five young men of color who were wrongly convicted of assaulting a white jogger. Trump "" who rarely holds his tongue "" has been silent in the face of a long list of high-profile killings by police of black men, including Eric Garner, who was placed in a chokehold and whose dying words, 'I can't breathe,' became a rallying cry for the Black Lives Matter movement. (Trump has instead invoked those words on several occasions to mock political rivals, even bringing his hands to his neck for dramatic effect.) He spent years railing against NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick and other players for kneeling during the National Anthem to protest racial injustice and police brutality. And in one speech he appeared to advocate rougher treatment of people in custody, speaking dismissively of the police practice of shielding the heads of handcuffed suspects as they are being placed in patrol cars. At the same time, Trump and his campaign have tried to make inroads with black Americans, particularly after Biden suggested last week that black voters who support Trump 'ain't black.' A bedrock of the Democratic base, black Americans are unlikely to embrace Trump en masse, but his campaign believes even a marginal shift could make a difference "" and send a message to white voters uneasy about the president's charged rhetoric. Meanwhile, the unrest complicates the Trump campaign's plans for Minnesota, one of the key swing states he hopes to win in November. Twitter's decision to flag Trump's tweet "" the second time it has acted this week "" came a day after he signed an executive order challenging the social media giant's protections against lawsuits as he accuses it of stifling conservative voices. The warning label prevented the tweet from being shared or liked, though it could still be viewed by users. The White House, trying to skirt the blockage, reposted the message on its own official Twitter account Friday morning. Twitter quickly flagged that tweet, too, accusing the White House of promoting violence. Supporters of the president balked at the move. Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale accused the media, Biden and other Democrats of 'purposefully misrepresenting what the President had said, and showing once again that they are incapable of resisting their base impulse of dividing Americans, solely for the purpose of political gain, ratings, and cable news profit.'",0.0

He drew an implicit contrast with President Donald Trump, who has suggested authorities could respond with violence to the protests that followed George Floyd's death. 'The original sin of this country still stains our nation today,' Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, said in remarks broadcast from his home in Wilmington, Delaware. ""It's time for us to take a hard look at uncomfortable truths.' Biden announced his bid for the presidency last year arguing he's uniquely positioned to unite a deeply divided country. He pointed to Trump's response to a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, as unworthy of America's people and values. As the country endures another spasm of racial unrest, the central premise of Biden's campaign is being tested. Biden is responding by positioning himself as an empathetic counter to Trump, who often struggles to convey emotion or connect on a personal level during moments of crisis. Biden said he spoke with Floyd's family and demanded justice for his death while calling for 'real police reform that holds all cops up to the high standards that so many of them actually meet.' The president later said that he, too, had spoken with Floyd's family and called them 'terrific people.' Trump initially condemned police actions in Floyd's death but later agitated the unrest by tweeting that protesters could be met with violent police resistance. He threatened to take action to bring Minneapolis 'under control,' called violent protesters outraged by the killing 'thugs' and revived a civil-rights-era phrase fraught with racist overtones. 'When the looting starts, the shooting starts,' Trump wrote in a tweet that was flagged by Twitter as violating rules against 'glorifying violence.' The White House said the president 'did not glorify violence. He clearly condemned it.' By Friday afternoon, Trump sought to acknowledge the shocking circumstances of Floyd's death while commending law enforcement. 'He was in tremendous pain, obviously, and couldn't breathe,' the president said of Floyd. 'It was a very, very sad thing for me to see it. We also know that most policemen, you see the great job they do."" Biden, without mentioning Trump by name, made clear he would approach the presidency differently. 'This is no time for incendiary tweets. This is no time to encourage violence,' Biden said. 'This is a national crisis, and we need real leadership right now. Leadership that will bring everyone to the table so we can take measures to root out systemic racism.' Later appearing on PBS, Biden pointed more openly at Trump: 'I think this president has stoked racism.' Rep. Val Demings, a Florida Democrat considered a potential Biden running mate, criticized Trump's response. 'America is on fire,' she said in an interview Friday. 'And this president is standing there with gasoline. He is dangerous. He's destructive, he's dangerous and he can't even rise to this occasion.' Amid the outrage, Biden tried to make the rest of the country feel what it was like to be African American in modern U.S. society. 'Every day, African Americans go about their lives with constant anxiety and trauma, wondering who will be next,' he said, adding, 'the anger and the frustration and the exhaustion "" it's undeniable.' Biden must go beyond establishing himself as a calming alternative to the president and demonstrate that he will take action that spurs the unity he's promised. It's a feat he may have to accomplish in a hurry if he wants to inspire African Americans to turn out for him in November. The task is especially critical after Biden suggested last week that African American voters who were still undecided between him and Trump 'ain't black,' a comment that some black leaders said were interpreted as taking their votes for granted. Biden quickly said he regretted the comment. NAACP President Derrick Johnson said he believes the nation is in chaos because of a lack of leadership in the White House. But he said change will only come by putting people in positions of power who will be willing to boldly address the needs of affected communities. 'I think the real question is, what are people going to do about it and how are those who are in positions of authority, and those who are seeking positions of authority, how are they going to lay out a plan moving forward?' Johnson said. 'It's about what is the collective will of this society to address the systemic deficits that we all know so well but lack the political will to address.' Moments of acute racial tension have afforded platforms for leadership from presidential candidates in the past. Robert F. Kennedy was seeking the White House in April 1968 and arriving in Indianapolis when he learned that Martin Luther King Jr. had been shot and killed. Kennedy stood on a flatbed truck and spoke about the country having to move past the terrible moments of racial strife "" comments later credited with preventing unrest. Kennedy was assassinated two months later. Black Lives Matter co-founder Alicia Garza said Biden needs to use this moment to connect further with black people and create a more robust black agenda that specifically tackles the need for policing reform and more. 'Black people cannot wait for an agenda that speaks to how it is that our lives will change under a new administration,' Garza said. 'We currently have a president who is inciting violence against black communities and yet, on the other hand, we have somebody who wants to lead this country that needs to go further in their plans, proposals and their vision for how to make sure that we deal with the state of emergency that black communities are facing.' 'It is not enough to engage in politics as usual,' Garza added, 'and expect results, as usual.' ___ Stafford reported from Detroit.

National Guard was called in as pockets of violence and vandalism erupted during a second straight night of protests over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis and President Donald Trump's response to it. Hundreds of people converged on the White House and marched along the National Mall, chanting 'Black Lives Matter,' 'I can't breathe' and 'No justice, no peace.' Protesters threw water bottles, traffic cones, scooters, even tear gas cans at police lines. They set fire to a car and a trash bin and smashed windows, including at Bay Atlantic University. 'What are you doing? That's a school,' one man yelled. An American flag hanging at the Export-Import Bank was taken down, burned and replaced with a Black Lives Matter banner. The D.C. demonstration was one of several around the country responding to the death of Floyd, a black man who died in police custody. Trump appeared to cheer on the tougher tactics being used by law enforcement to disperse protesters Saturday night. He commended National Guard troops deployed in Minneapolis, declaring 'No games!' and he also said police in New York City 'must be allowed to do their job!' 'Let New York's Finest be New York's Finest,' Trump said on Twitter after returning to the White House from Florida, where he watched the launch of a SpaceX rocket. He did not talk to reporters upon his return and it was not clear if he could hear the protest over the sound of his helicopter. But for at least part of the flight, televisions on Air Force One were turned to Fox News and its coverage of the protests. Earlier in the day, he had belittled the protesters and pledged to 'stop mob violence.' 'I stand before you as a friend and ally to every American seeking justice and peace, and I stand before you in firm opposition to anyone exploiting this tragedy to loot, rob, attack and menace,' the president said after watching the launch of a SpaceX rocket. 'Healing, not hatred, justice, not chaos, are the missions at hand.' Police were in tactical gear. The D.C. National Guard was activated at the direction of the secretary of the Army and at the request of the Park Police to help maintain order near the White House, Commanding Gen. William J. Walker said in a post on the Guard's Facebook page. 'We're sick of it. The cops are out of control,' protester Olga Hall said. 'They're wild. There's just been too many dead boys,' she said. Some vocal protesters directed their comments at a black police officer. 'Do you support this violence?' they asked him. 'How are you going to protect your kids?' The officer got emotional to the point he had to be relieved. An activist wearing a Black Lives Matter T-shirt put himself between police and the protesters and yelled, 'Stop. This is what they want.' Speaking over a megaphone earlier in the evening, Cameron McCall said, 'We don't need violence. All we need are our voices.' While some protesters stayed near the White House, others marched through the streets chanting, 'No justice and no peace.' and 'Say his name: George Floyd.' The mood was angry and several speakers implored marchers to remain peaceful. The march paused between the the Washington Monument and the National Museum of African American History and Culture. Demonstrators sat down in the street for a moment of silence lasting for the eight minutes or more that the Minneapolis police officer reportedly knelt on Floyd's neck. At the Lincoln Memorial, one organizer spoke over a megaphone. 'Look to the left and to the right and thank that person. We can't hug anybody because of COVID, but I love you anyway.' Many of the protesters wore masks, but did not socially distance themselves. Another group circled through the Capitol Hill neighborhood for at least an hour in cars, honking. A helicopter hovered overhead. In a series of tweets earlier Saturday, Trump doubted protesters' allegiance to Floyd's memory, saying they were 'professionally managed.' He offered no evidence to back his assertion, and the president even seemed to invite supporters to make their presence felt: 'Tonight, I understand, is MAGA NIGHT AT THE WHITE HOUSE???' Trump later rejected the suggestion that he was stoking a potential conflict between protesters and his supporters. 'I was just asking. But I have no idea if they are going to be here,"" he said. 'MAGA is Make America Great Again. By the way, they love African American people. They love black people.' At Saturday's demonstration, there was no evidence of a counter-move by Trump supporters. Trump said he had 'watched every move' from inside the executive mansion during Friday's protest and 'couldn't have felt more safe' as the Secret Service let the protesters carry on, 'but whenever someone ... got too frisky or out of line, they would quickly come down on then, hard "" didn't know what hit them.' The president also criticized the mayors of Washington and Minneapolis. Trump said Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey 'is probably a very good person, but he's a radical, left mayor.' He then described how he watched as a police station in the city was overrun. 'For that police station to be abandoned and taken over, I've never seen anything so horrible and stupid in my life,"" Trump said when speaking briefly to reporters at the White House. He said Minnesota officials have to get tougher with rioters, and that by doing so they would be honoring the memory of Floyd. The Secret Service said in a statement Saturday that six protesters were arrested in Washington and 'multiple' officers were injured. There were no details on the charges or nature of the injuries. A spokesman for U.S. Park Police said their officers made no arrests, but several suffered minor injuries and one was taken to a hospital after being struck in the helmet by a projectile. Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf on Saturday called the protesters 'criminals' who committed 'acts of violence while hiding behind their First Amendment right of lawful protest.' Late Saturday and early Sunday, protesters vented their rage by breaking into tony shops of Georgetown, on the western edge of the District, and in downtown Washington, breaking windows and glass doors of many stores and looting some of them. In his tweeting, Trump claimed that many Secret Service agents were 'just waiting for action' and ready to unleash 'the most vicious dogs, and the most ominous weapons, I have ever seen."" His reference to 'vicious dogs' potentially being sicced on protesters revisits images from the civil rights movement when marchers faced snarling police dogs and high-pressure fire hoses. In a news conference Saturday afternoon, Muriel Bowser, mayor of the nation's capital, called Trump's remarks 'gross' and said the reference to attack dogs conjures up with the worst memories of the nation's fight against segregation. 'I call upon our city and our nation to exercise restraint, great restraint, even as the president tries to divide us,' she said. 'I feel like these comments are an attack on humanity, an attack on black America, and they make my city less safe.' In contrast with the president's tweets, the Secret Service said it 'respects the right to assemble and we ask that individuals do so peacefully for the safety of all.' ___ AP video journalist Nathan Ellgren contributed to this report.",0.0
1620733324,2020-05-30 02:26:06,National Guard summoned to aid cities amid police clashes,https://www.newportri.com/ZZ/news/20200530/national-guard-summoned-to-aid-cities-amid-police-clashes?rssfeed=true,en,True,,662951,Newport Life,http://www.newportlifemagazine.com/,"MINNEAPOLIS (AP) "" Tense protests over the death of George Floyd and other police killings of black people grew Saturday from New York to Tulsa to Los Angeles, with police cars set ablaze and reports of injuries mounting on all sides as the country convulsed through another night of unrest after months of coronavirus lockdowns. The protests, which began in Minneapolis following Floyd's death Monday after a police officer pressed a knee on his neck until he stopped breathing, have left parts of the city a grid of broken windows, burned-out buildings and ransacked stores. The unrest has since become a national phenomenon as protesters decry years of deaths at police hands. Tens of thousands of people were in the streets across the country, many of them not wearing masks or observing social distancing, raising concerns among health experts about the potential for spreading the coronavirus pandemic at a time when much of the country is in the process of reopening society and the economy. After a tumultuous Friday, racially diverse crowds held mostly peaceful demonstrations in dozens of cities, though many later descended into violence as had happened the previous night. Few corners of America were untouched, from protesters setting fires inside Reno's city hall, to police launching tear gas at rock-throwing demonstrators in Fargo, North Dakota, to shattered windows at police headquarters in Richmond, Virginia. "" In Indianapolis, police were investigating 'multiple shootings' downtown, including one that left a person dead, amid the protests. Police gave few details but said no officers were involved. "" In Washington, the National Guard was deployed outside the White House, where chanting crowds taunted law enforcement officers. Dressed in camouflage and holding shields, the troops stood in a tight line a few yards from the crowd, preventing them from pushing forward. President Donald Trump, who spent much of Saturday in Florida for the SpaceX rocket launch, landed on the lawn in the presidential helicopter at dusk and went inside without speaking to journalists. "" In Philadelphia, at least 13 officers were injured when peaceful protests turned violent and at least four police vehicles were set on fire. Other fires were set throughout downtown. "" In Salt Lake City, protesters defied a curfew and National Guard troops were deployed by Utah's governor. Demonstrators flipped a police car and lit it on fire, and another vehicle was later set ablaze. Police said six people were arrested and a police officer was injured after being struck in the head with a baseball bat. "" In Los Angeles, protesters chanted 'Black Lives Matter,' some within inches of the face shields of officers. Police used batons to move the crowd back and fired rubber bullets. A graffiti-covered police car burned in the street. "" And in New York City, dangerous confrontations flared repeatedly as officers made arrests and cleared streets. A video showed two NYPD cruisers lurching into a crowd of demonstrators who were pushing a barricade against one of them and pelting it with objects. Several people were knocked to the ground, and it was unclear if anyone was hurt. 'The mistakes that are happening are not mistakes. They're repeated violent terrorist offenses and people need to stop killing black people,"" Brooklyn protester Meryl Makielski said. Not all protests devolved into violence. In Juneau, Alaska, law enforcement officers joined elected officials and residents at a peaceful protest in front of a giant whale sculpture on the city's waterfront. 'We don't tolerate excessive use of force,' Juneau Police Chief Ed Mercer told the gathering. Back in Minneapolis, the city where the protests began, police, state troopers and National Guard members moved in soon after an 8 p.m. curfew took effect to break up protests, firing tear gas and rubber bullets to clear streets outside a police precinct and elsewhere. The show of force came after three days when police largely avoided engaging protesters, and after the state poured in more than 4,000 National Guard troops to Minneapolis and said the number would soon rise to nearly 11,000. 'The situation in Minneapolis is no longer in any way about the murder of George Floyd,' said Gov. Tim Walz, who also said local forces had been overmatched the previous day. 'It is about attacking civil society, instilling fear and disrupting our great cities.' Minneapolis' streets steadily grew calmer as the night went on, and Corrections Commissioner Paul Schnell said the tough response would remain as long as it takes to 'quell this situation.' Some residents were glad to see the upheaval dissipating. 'l live here. I haven't been able to sleep,"" said Iman Muhammad, whose neighborhood saw multiple fires set Friday night. Muhammad said she sympathized with peaceful protests over Floyd's death but disagreed with the violence: 'Wrong doesn't answer wrong."" Trump appeared to cheer on the tougher tactics Saturday night, commending the Guard deployment in Minneapolis, declaring 'No games!' and saying police in New York City 'must be allowed to do their job!' Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden condemned the violence as he continued to express common cause with those demonstrating after Floyd's death. 'The act of protesting should never be allowed to overshadow the reason we protest,' Biden said in a statement Saturday night. Overnight curfews were imposed in more than a dozen major cities nationwide, including Atlanta, Denver, Los Angeles, Minneapolis and Seattle. More than 1,300 people have been arrested in 16 cities since Thursday, including over 500 Friday in Los Angeles. The unrest comes at a time when most Americans have spent months inside over concerns surrounding the coronavirus, which the president has called an 'invisible enemy.' The events of the last 72 hours, seen live on national television, have shown the opposite: a sudden pivot to crowds, screaming protesters and burning buildings, and a stark contrast to the empty streets of recent months. 'Quite frankly I'm ready to just lock people up,"" Atlanta Police Chief Erika Shields said at a news conference. Demonstrations there turned violent Friday, and police were arresting protesters Saturday on blocked-off downtown streets. 'Yes, you caught us off balance once. It's not going to happen twice.' This week's unrest recalled the riots in Los Angeles nearly 30 years ago after the acquittal of the white police officers who beat Rodney King, a black motorist who had led them on a high-speed chase. The protests of Floyd's killing have gripped many more cities, but the losses in Minneapolis have yet to approach the staggering totals Los Angeles saw during five days of rioting in 1992, when more than 60 people died, 2,000-plus were injured and thousands arrested, with property damage topping $1 billion. Many protesters spoke of frustration that Floyd's death was one more in a litany. It came in the wake of the killing in Georgia of Ahmaud Arbery, a black man who was shot dead after being pursued by two white men while running in their neighborhood, and in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic that has thrown millions out of work, killed more than 100,000 people in the U.S. and disproportionately affected black people. The officer who held his knee to Floyd's neck as he begged for air was arrested Friday and charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. But many protesters are demanding the arrests of the three other officers involved. Trump stoked the anger on Twitter, saying that if protesters had breached the White House fence, they would 'have been greeted with the most vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons, I have ever seen.' Leaders in many affected cities have voiced outrage over Floyd's killing and expressed sympathy for protesters' concerns. But as the unrest intensified, they spoke of a desperate need to protect their cities and said they would call in reinforcements, despite concerns that could lead to more heavy-handed tactics. Governors in Georgia, Kentucky, Ohio and Texas also activated the National Guard after protests there turned violent. Police in St. Louis were investigating the death of a protester who climbed between two trailers of a Fed Ex truck and was killed when it drove away. And a person was killed in the area of protests in downtown Detroit just before midnight after someone fired shots into an SUV, officers said. Police had initially said someone fired into the crowd from an SUV. ___ Numerous AP journalists contributed from across the U.S.",0.0

'Progress and change can ebb and flow,' said Jeremiah Ellison, who won a City Council seat after participating in past protests against police killings of African Americans in Minnesota. The four nights of unrest this week "" including the torching of a police station that officers abandoned "" 'proved to me that we've regressed to the point of 2015,' Ellison said, referring to the year that also saw protests after the death of Jamar Clark, a black man killed by police. Minneapolis "" a city of nearly 430,000 that is 60% white, 19% black and 9% Hispanic "" has a long history of economic and educational disparities that have marginalized black residents for decades, despite its reputation for progressive values. It is one of the most segregated cities in the country for its size, and schools suffer from stubborn achievement gaps. The city appointed its first black chief of police nearly three years ago, after slow progress toward making the department more inclusive. Earlier this year, a statewide task force made up of activists, people representing victims of police brutality, and law enforcement leaders released recommendations for policing reforms. That task force was formed in the wake of several high-profile fatal shootings of black men by police in the Minneapolis area. Those included Clark, who was killed during a struggle with two white Minneapolis officers, and Philando Castile, who was fatally shot by a Hispanic suburban police officer during a traffic stop in 2016. While Nekima Levy Armstrong, a civil rights lawyer and former president of the Minneapolis NAACP, acknowledges that progress, she said that many old habits are still entrenched. 'The system itself has not changed,"" Armstrong said. ""The culture within the Minneapolis Police Department has not changed.' The city's police department of more than 800 officers is still predominantly white, she said. The department did not respond to a request for up-to-date figures, but the Star Tribune reported in 2014 that the force, including cadets in field training, was 78.9% white, 9.2% black, 5.2% Asian, 4.1% Hispanic and 2.5% American Indian. Some leaders, including former Mayor R.T. Rybak and state Sen. Jeff Hayden, have blamed the city's police union in recent days for fostering a culture that protects brutal officers and resists efforts at reform. The union's president, Lt. Bob Kroll, did not return a call seeking comment. The eruption of anger in Minneapolis reflects frustration over these realities, despite some progress, said Teqen Z�a-Aida, a longtime activist in the city. But the images themselves also demanded a 'public response,' he said, though he pushed for protests to happen online given the risks of gatherings during the coronavirus pandemic. 'We saw his eyes ... we saw a lynching. George Floyd is Emmett Till, 2020,' he said, referring to the black 14-year-old who was abducted, beaten and killed in 1955 after he was accused of whistling at a white woman in Mississippi, a lynching that helped spur the civil rights movement. Bystander video and photos of the arrest showed Floyd on the ground, while Officer Derek Chauvin kneels on his neck, ignoring his pleas for help. Two other officers appear to help hold him down, and a fourth attempts to keep space around the scene. 'My stomach hurts, my neck hurts, everything hurts ... I can't breathe,' said Floyd, who eventually becomes motionless. Police initially said they arrested Floyd because he matched the description of a man suspected of passing a counterfeit $20 bill at a grocery store and that he resisted arrest. Police were trying to put Floyd in a squad car when he stiffened up and fell to the ground, saying he was claustrophobic, according to the criminal complaint detailing charges against Chauvin. In addition to igniting the turmoil in Minneapolis, Floyd's death has garnered national attention, and it drew comparisons to the case of Eric Garner, a black man who died in 2014 in New York after he was placed in a chokehold by police and also said he could not breathe. The delay in Chauvin's arrest may have also helped to drive the protests, which turned markedly more violent than those that followed the deaths of either Clark or Castile. Authorities arrested Chauvin and charged him Friday with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. His attorney had no comment when reached by the AP. The other three officers involved have not been charged, but the investigation is continuing. All four were fired Tuesday shortly after the video began circulating. Some activists and community leaders said they expected the protests to continue to push for the arrests of and charges for the three other officers. Floyd's death 'just touched people in a way that they didn't expect,' said Armstrong. 'We must get to the underlying solutions or we will be right back here in a fairly short time,' said Keith Ellison, the state's first African American attorney general, whose son is the Minneapolis city councilman. 'We've got to literally shift policing.' Ramsey County Undersheriff Bill Finney, who in 1992 became the first African American police chief in Minnesota when he was appointed to the job in neighboring St. Paul, said even when the relationship between police and the black community improves, all sides must guard against complacency. 'You have to constantly make deposits into the community bank of goodwill,' Finney said. 'You want to get to a place where the community stops considering you as 'the police' and starts seeing you as their police.' ___ Morrison and Nasir are members of the AP's Race and Ethnicity team.

George Floyd is Emmett Till, 2020,' he said, referring to the black 14-year-old who was abducted, beaten and killed in 1955 after he was accused of whistling at a white woman in Mississippi, a lynching that helped spur the civil rights movement. Bystander video and photos of the arrest showed Floyd on the ground, while Officer Derek Chauvin kneels on his neck, ignoring his pleas for help. Two other officers appear to help hold him down, and a fourth attempts to keep space around the scene. 'My stomach hurts, my neck hurts, everything hurts ... I can't breathe,' said Floyd, who eventually becomes motionless. Police initially said they arrested Floyd because he matched the description of a man suspected of passing a counterfeit $20 bill at a grocery store and that he resisted arrest. Police were trying to put Floyd in a squad car when he stiffened up and fell to the ground, saying he was claustrophobic, according to the criminal complaint detailing charges against Chauvin. In addition to igniting the turmoil in Minneapolis, Floyd's death has garnered national attention, and it drew comparisons to the case of Eric Garner, a black man who died in 2014 in New York after he was placed in a chokehold by police and also said he could not breathe. The delay in Chauvin's arrest may have also helped to drive the protests, which turned markedly more violent than those that followed the deaths of either Clark or Castile. Authorities arrested Chauvin and charged him Friday with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. His attorney had no comment when reached by the AP. The other three officers involved have not been charged, but the investigation is continuing. All four were fired Tuesday shortly after the video began circulating. Some activists and community leaders said they expected the protests to continue to push for the arrests of and charges for the three other officers. Floyd's death 'just touched people in a way that they didn't expect,' said Armstrong. 'We must get to the underlying solutions or we will be right back here in a fairly short time,' said Keith Ellison, the state's first African American attorney general, whose son is the Minneapolis city councilman. 'We've got to literally shift policing.' Ramsey County Undersheriff Bill Finney, who in 1992 became the first African American police chief in Minnesota when he was appointed to the job in neighboring St. Paul, said even when the relationship between police and the black community improves, all sides must guard against complacency. 'You have to constantly make deposits into the community bank of goodwill,' Finney said. 'You want to get to a place where the community stops considering you as 'the police' and starts seeing you as their police.' ___ Morrison and Nasir are members of the AP's Race and Ethnicity team.

Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Chief Randal Taylor confirmed the shootings during a late night news conference, but didn't offer any more details. Police later tweeted that no officers were involved. Protests became dangerous for a second straight night in Indianapolis as buildings were damaged, officers deployed tear gas and at least one business was briefly on fire. ___ Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden condemned the violence in a statement, as he continued to express common cause with those demonstrating after Floyd's death. 'The act of protesting should never be allowed to overshadow the reason we protest,' Biden said in a statement Saturday night. 'It should not drive people away from the just cause that protest is meant to advance.' ___ MINNEAPOLIS "" Officials in Minneapolis say they've succeeded for now in stopping the violent protests that ravaged parts of the city for several days after the death of George Floyd. Police, state troopers and National Guard members moved in to break up protests after an 8 p.m. curfew took effect, firing tear gas and rubber bullets to clear streets outside a police precinct and elsewhere. The show of force came after three days where police mostly declined to engage with protesters. It also came after the state poured in more than 4,000 National Guard members and said the number would soon rise to nearly 11,000. As Minneapolis streets appeared largely quiet, Corrections Commissioner Paul Schnell said the heavy response would remain as long as it takes to 'quell this situation.' Floyd, a handcuffed black man, died after a Minneapolis police officer kneeled on his neck for several minutes. ___ RICHMOND, Va. "" The Richmond, Virginia, police headquarters was the target of protesters for the second night in a row as officers formed a barricade around the building late Saturday night. A dumpster was set afire near the police headquarters, which had its front windows broken out Friday night. The Richmond Times-Dispatch reported that the police fired tear gas to move crowds away from the building. Several blocks away near Virginia Commonwealth University hundreds of protesters blocked streets chanting 'George Floyd,' referring to the black man who died Monday after an arresting officer in Minneapolis pushed his knee into Floyd's neck while he was on the ground handcuffed. Media reports showed video of protesters hurling what appeared to be water bottles at a police car, which moved through the crowd and sped away. A police cruiser was burned in the violence on Friday night, along with a city bus. ___ LOS ANGELES -- The mayor of Los Angeles says the National Guard will be deployed overnight to help local law enforcement quell violence in the nation's second-largest city. Mayor Eric Garcetti says he asked California Gov. Gavin Newsom on Saturday to send 500 to 700 members of the Guard. Crowds of demonstrators have torched police cars, vandalized and burglarized stores and clashed with lines of officers. Hundreds of people have been arrested since Friday night. ___ SALT LAKE CITY "" Protests are continuing in Salt Lake City despite a curfew issued by the mayor and National Guard troops deployed by Utah's governor. Police officials say they are prepared to give people time to leave, but they plan to arrest people who refused to comply. What started as a peaceful demonstration Saturday against the death of George Floyd turned destructive. A group of people flipped over a police car and lit it on fire. A second car was later set on fire. Police officials say six people have been arrested and that a police officer was injured after being struck in the head with a baseball bat. ___ RENO, Nevada -- City officials in Reno instituted an immediate mandatory curfew Saturday night after protesters broke windows at City Hall and set fires. Police fired tear gas into the building, the Rene Gazette Journal reported, and a SWAT team arrived to help disperse the crowd. The fires were extinguished. In announcing the curfew in a statement, city officials asked residents to avoid the downtown area, where a 'heavy police presence' would be in force overnight. ___ RALEIGH, N.C. "" More than 1,000 people marched in downtown Raleigh on Saturday night, breaking windows as police in riot gear released tear gas and pepper spray to disburse the crowds. WRAL-TV showed video of throngs of people in front of the Wake County Courthouse, some walking with signs, others on bikes and skateboards to protest the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis by a police officer on Monday. Protesters gathered in late afternoon marching peacefully north from the courthouse chanting 'No Justice, No Peace.' But tension grew after nightfall as some people threw rocks at windows and spray painted anti-police slogans on walls. Fayetteville Street was the focus of most of the vandalism with multiple buildings along the street having windows broken out. ___ MIAMI "" A student at Florida International University said the protest was largely peaceful with the crowd of about 500 'singing, we were doing poetry' and urging each other not to 'break windows' or hurt businesses. But when they arrived at the police station, another group of protesters also converged there and things escalated within minutes. 'There was a sniper on the roof with the police chief standing next to him and they started throwing smoke bombs to the crowd,"" 27-year-old Liseth Hatta said. 'Most of them were kids. They couldn't' have been older than 21. Everyone ran away screaming;' They tried to flee and rushed to the train station to head home, but police closed down the entrance. 'A lot of people tried to get back on the train to leave and they weren't letting us,' Hatta said. 'They basically trapped us in.' ___ ATLANTA "" An Atlanta police officer was struck by someone riding an ATV in downtown Atlanta during protests that continued despite a curfew, and police said they were still trying to determine whether the crash was deliberate. Police spokesman Carlos Campos said it happened about 10:30 p.m.; the mayor had set a 9 p.m. curfew. The officer suffered significant injuries and was in stable condition, Campos said. The ATV drive suffered minor injuries and was taken into custody, Campos said. ___ LOS ANGELES "" Police have arrested nearly 1,400 people in 17 U.S. cities as protests continue over the death of George Floyd. Floyd died Monday in Minnesota after a police officer put his knee on Floyd's neck for more than eight minutes. The officer was arrested Friday and charged with third-degree murder. But the arrest has done little to quell protests across the country. Most have been peaceful. But a few have erupted in violence. An Associated Press tally of arrests found at least 1,383 people have been arrested since Thursday. The actual number is likely higher as protests continue Saturday night. ___ WASHINGTON "" The National Guard has been called out in Washington, D.C., as pockets of violence erupted during a second straight night of protests over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis and President Donald Trump's reaction to it. Hundreds of protesters converged on the White House during the day Saturday and marched on the National Mall, chanting 'Black Lives Matter,' 'I can't breathe' and 'No justice, no peace.' Police used pepper spray to try to disperse the crowd but the standoff continued. Protesters dragged away barricades and some broke up concrete to use as projectiles. At one point, a trash bin was set on fire. National Guard troops took up position around the White House on Saturday night.___ WASHINGTON "" President Donald Trump appears to be cheering on the tougher tactics being used by law enforcement around the country to confront sometimes violent demonstrators joining in protests over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. On Saturday, the president commended National Guard troops deployed in Minneapolis, declaring 'No games!' He also said police in New York City 'must be allowed to do their job!' In a tweet, Trump said: 'Let New York's Finest be New York's Finest.' He was commenting on Twitter from the White House while crowds of protesters gathered outside. ___ NASHVILLE, Tennessee "" The mayor of Nashville, Tennessee, has declared a state of civil emergency after protesters set a fire inside the Metro Courthouse in the state's capital city. Thousands had rallied near the Capitol building Saturday afternoon to peacefully protest police brutality and racism. But things turned violent after darkness fell, with protesters breaking windows in government buildings and causing other property damage. The Tennessean newspaper says demonstrators also pulled down a statue outside the Capitol of Edward Carmack, a controversial former lawmaker and newspaper publisher who espoused racist views. Police deployed tear gas and began warning demonstrators that the protest was unlawful. Gov. Bill Lee issued an order Saturday night for the National Guard to mobilize 'in response to protests that have now taken a violent, unlawful turn in Nashville.' ___ MINNEAPOLIS "" Police in Minneapolis are confronting protesters out after curfew on the fifth day of protests over the death of George Floyd. A group of marchers was moving north toward downtown on a city street when officers fired tear gas Saturday night. The group immediately retreated. Soon after, officers fired tear gas and moved in to push away throngs of protesters who were milling around the city police's 5th Precinct. The tougher tactics came after city and state leaders were criticized for not more strongly confronting violent and damaging protests. Minneapolis has been the epicenter of protests since the death Monday of Floyd after a police officer pressed his knee on Floyd's neck for some eight minutes. The protests have spread to cities across the United States. ___ CHICAGO "" Chicago's mayor has announced an overnight curfew in the city running from 9 p.m. Saturday until 6 a.m. Sunday, and she says police will crack down on any violence. Mayor Lori Lightfoot says that peaceful protesting over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis has 'devolved into criminal conduct.' She says police will be aggressive with arrests for anyone caught damaging property. In the mayor's words: 'We can have zero tolerance for people who came prepared for a fight and tried to initiate and provoke our police department.' ___ MIAMI "" An initially peaceful protest in Miami over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis has turned violent, with some demonstrators setting fire to police cars. Witnesses to the clash Saturday say officers responded with tear gas and fireworks to disperse the crowd. The mayor has declared a 10 p.m. curfew. At one point, Interstate 95 was shut down as protesters stood on the busy highway. Police also used bicycles to push back an increasingly rowdy crowd throwing rocks. Elsewhere in Florida, protesters in Tampa smashed store windows and set a gas station ablaze Saturday night after a peaceful demonstration during the day. Some broke into AT&T and Gold N Diamond stores. ___ Curfews are in effect or imminent in more than a dozen U.S. cities facing rising unrest following the death of George Floyd. The start times Saturday evening range from 6 p.m. in parts of South Carolina to 10 p.m. around Ohio. People are being told to get off the streets beginning at 8 p.m. or 9 p.m. in Atlanta, Denver, Los Angeles and Seattle. A curfew is in effect for a second night in and around Minneapolis, where Floyd died earlier this week after a police officer pressed his knee on Floyd's neck for more than eight minutes during an arrest. Thousands ignored the Friday night curfew and peaceful protests gave way to violence late into the night. ___ PHILADELPHIA "" Authorities in Philadelphia say a peaceful demonstration protesting the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis later turned violence, and at least 13 police officers have been injured amid incidents of arson and store break-ins in the city's doqwntown. Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw says at least four police vehicles were set ablaze and other fires were set throughout downtown Saturday afternoon. Protesters smashed windows and stole merchandise from stores as police tried to worked to corral the crowd, which Outlaw estimates numbered about 3,000. Protesters also sprayed graffiti on a statue of former Philadelphia Mayor Frank Rizzo, tried to topple it and set a fire at its base. Rizzo was Philadelphia's mayor from 1972 to 1980 and was praised by supporters as tough on crime but accused by critics of discriminating against minorities. Authorities in Philadelphia have ordered a citywide curfew has been implemented from 8 p.m. Saturday to 7 a.m. Sunday. ___ SALT LAKE CITY "" Utah Gov. Gary Herbert has activated the Utah National Guard after protesters angry over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis turned violent during a demonstration at which some participants carried rifles in Salt Lake City. Herbert says in a tweet that the Guard will help control 'the escalating situation' in the downtown area following the unrest Saturday afternoon. The protest started out peacefully, but degenerated into violence. A group of people flipped over a police car and lit it on fire. Some demonstrators smashed eggs and wrote graffiti on the walls of the Salt Lake City police station. Others marched through downtown to the state Capitol. Some people in the protest openly carried rifles, which is legal in Utah. ___ LOS ANGELES -- Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti has imposed a downtown curfew for Saturday night after some protests over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis turned violent. With protesters were back out Saturday, Garcetti said everyone must be off down town streets by 8 p.m. and stay away until 5:30 a.m. Several police cars were torched Saturday afternoon as some protesters ignored authorities' call for peaceful demonstrations. That followed a night of violence during which people smashed windows, robbed stores and set fires. Los Angeles police reported arresting 533 people during the night. ___ SEATTLE "" The Washington State Patrol has closed Interstate 5 in both directions through downtown Seattle after a protest over the death of George Floyd spilled onto the freeway. Thousands of people gathered in the downtown area Saturday for a largely peaceful demonstration, but some protesters turned rowdier as the afternoon worn on. Police used pepper spray on the demonstrators and deployed flash bang devices. Police said arrests were made but an exact figure wasn't available. State patrol Chief John Batiste said in a statement that 'the freeway is not a safe or appropriate place for demonstration.' ___ ATLANTA "" A crowd has gathered in Atlanta to protest the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis and some people have started throwing objects at officers guarding the Georgia governor's mansion. Hundreds of people stood on a residential sidewalk Saturday evening across the street from the mansion in the city's affluent Buckhead neighborhood. Cars and motorcyclists continued to sporadically drive by in front of the demonstrators. Authorities responded by taking at least one person into custody. Gov. Brian Kemp was not inside the home Saturday evening. Earlier in the day, Atlanta's mayor announced a curfew will be in effect in the city from 9 p.m. Saturday to sunrise Sunday. That order followed a night of violence that erupted in the city during demonstrations over Floyd's death. ___ MINNEAPOLIS "" Several Minneapolis City Council members are asking Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz to appoint the state's attorney general as a special prosecutor in the death of George Floyd. Six of the council's 13 members say they support a call from Floyd's family for Attorney General Keith Ellison to handle the prosecution of the police officer who held his knee on Floyd's neck Monday. The council members say they don't think Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman has the public trust necessary for the job. Freeman on Friday charged now-fired officer Derek Chauvin with third-degree murder in Floyd's death. Chauvin is white; Floyd was black. The council members say Freeman waited too long in bringing charge. They say Ellison, who is black, is best qualified to handle the case. They also cite a working group he helped lead on deaths involving police. ___ WASHINGTON "" Several hundred people shouting 'Black Lives Matter' and 'I can't breathe' have converged on the White House for a second straight day to protest the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis and President Donald Trump's response. Trump earlier on Saturday belittled the protesters and he pledged to 'stop mob violence.' Speaking in Florida after watching the launch of a SpaceX rocket, the president said: 'I stand before you as a friend and ally to every American seeking justice and peace, and I stand before you in firm opposition to anyone exploiting this tragedy to loot, rob, attack and menace. Healing, not hatred, justice, not chaos are the missions at hand.' Three lines of barricades separate protesters from a loose line of uniformed police officers at Lafayette Park, across from the White House. At one point, the protesters left the park, chanting as they marched up a nearby street. A block from the White House, they held a moment of silence and brief sit-in. ___ ATLANTA -- Atlanta's mayor has announced a curfew will be in effect from 9 p.m. Saturday to sunrise Sunday following violence that erupted in the city during demonstrations over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms announced the curfew during a news conference Saturday evening. She called it a 'very unusual and extreme step' after the violence that rocked Atlanta during Friday night. Several other cities across the nation have order curfews following unrest surrounding demonstrations protesting Floyd's death. Georgia's governor declared a state of emergency early Saturday to activate the state National Guard as violence flared in Atlanta. In Friday's protests, some demonstrators smashed police cars and spray-painted the iconic logo sign at CNN headquarters downtown. Police say at least three officers were hurt and there were multiple arrests as protesters shot at officers with BB guns and threw bricks, bottles and knives. Atlanta officials said crews were temporarily unable to reach a fire at a restaurant because of crowds of protesters. ___ NEW YORK "" Protesters angry over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis have returned to the streets of New York for a third straight day as Mayor Bill de Blasio pleads for calm after a demonstration in Brooklyn the previous night descended into chaos that left people bloodied and vehicles burned. On Saturday, a large crowd marched through Harlem, chanted outside a police precinct and then blocked traffic on the highway along Manhattan's East River. Demonstrations of several thousand at Union Square and outside Brooklyn's Prospect Park appeared mostly peaceful. Late in the day, protesters in Brooklyn confronted police, who shoved some of the demonstrators and used an irritating chemical spray. De Blasio expressed solidarity with demonstrators upset over police brutality, but promised an independent review of the Friday night confrontation in which both protesters and police officers engaged in violence. The mayor said he was upset by videos of the clashes in which 'protesters were handled very violently' by police and by reports that a state senator and member of the state Assembly were among the people sprayed with irritating chemicals by officers. ___ CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla "" President Donald Trump says he will not tolerate mob violence during demonstrations over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. The president made the comment as he spoke in Florida after watching the successful launch of a SpaceX rocket Saturday. He turned his attention to the unrest in American cities following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis before he congratulated NASA and others involved in the space mission.

Police, state troopers and National Guard members moved in to break up protests after an 8 p.m. curfew took effect, firing tear gas and rubber bullets to clear streets outside a police precinct and elsewhere. The show of force came after three days where police mostly declined to engage with protesters. It also came after the state poured in more than 4,000 National Guard members and said the number would soon rise to nearly 11,000. As Minneapolis streets appeared largely quiet, Corrections Commissioner Paul Schnell said the heavy response would remain as long as it takes to 'quell this situation.' Floyd, a handcuffed black man, died after a Minneapolis police officer kneeled on his neck for several minutes. ___ RICHMOND, Va. "" The Richmond, Virginia, police headquarters was the target of protesters for the second night in a row as officers formed a barricade around the building late Saturday night. A dumpster was set afire near the police headquarters, which had its front windows broken out Friday night. The Richmond Times-Dispatch reported that the police fired tear gas to move crowds away from the building. Several blocks away near Virginia Commonwealth University hundreds of protesters blocked streets chanting 'George Floyd,' referring to the black man who died Monday after an arresting officer in Minneapolis pushed his knee into Floyd's neck while he was on the ground handcuffed. Media reports showed video of protesters hurling what appeared to be water bottles at a police car, which moved through the crowd and sped away. A police cruiser was burned in the violence on Friday night, along with a city bus. ___ LOS ANGELES -- The mayor of Los Angeles says the National Guard will be deployed overnight to help local law enforcement quell violence in the nation's second-largest city. Mayor Eric Garcetti says he asked California Gov. Gavin Newsom on Saturday to send 500 to 700 members of the Guard. Crowds of demonstrators have torched police cars, vandalized and burglarized stores and clashed with lines of officers. Hundreds of people have been arrested since Friday night. ___ SALT LAKE CITY "" Protests are continuing in Salt Lake City despite a curfew issued by the mayor and National Guard troops deployed by Utah's governor. Police officials say they are prepared to give people time to leave, but they plan to arrest people who refused to comply.

A second car was later set on fire. Police officials say six people have been arrested and that a police officer was injured after being struck in the head with a baseball bat. ___ RENO, Nevada -- City officials in Reno instituted an immediate mandatory curfew Saturday night after protesters broke windows at City Hall and set fires. Police fired tear gas into the building, the Rene Gazette Journal reported, and a SWAT team arrived to help disperse the crowd. The fires were extinguished. In announcing the curfew in a statement, city officials asked residents to avoid the downtown area, where a 'heavy police presence' would be in force overnight. ___ RALEIGH, N.C. "" More than 1,000 people marched in downtown Raleigh on Saturday night, breaking windows as police in riot gear released tear gas and pepper spray to disburse the crowds. WRAL-TV showed video of throngs of people in front of the Wake County Courthouse, some walking with signs, others on bikes and skateboards to protest the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis by a police officer on Monday. Protesters gathered in late afternoon marching peacefully north from the courthouse chanting 'No Justice, No Peace.' But tension grew after nightfall as some people threw rocks at windows and spray painted anti-police slogans on walls. Fayetteville Street was the focus of most of the vandalism with multiple buildings along the street having windows broken out. ___ MIAMI "" A student at Florida International University said the protest was largely peaceful with the crowd of about 500 'singing, we were doing poetry' and urging each other not to 'break windows' or hurt businesses. But when they arrived at the police station, another group of protesters also converged there and things escalated within minutes. 'There was a sniper on the roof with the police chief standing next to him and they started throwing smoke bombs to the crowd,"" 27-year-old Liseth Hatta said. 'Most of them were kids. They couldn't' have been older than 21. Everyone ran away screaming;' They tried to flee and rushed to the train station to head home, but police closed down the entrance.

'They basically trapped us in.' ___ ATLANTA "" An Atlanta police officer was struck by someone riding an ATV in downtown Atlanta during protests that continued despite a curfew, and police said they were still trying to determine whether the crash was deliberate. Police spokesman Carlos Campos said it happened about 10:30 p.m.; the mayor had set a 9 p.m. curfew. The officer suffered significant injuries and was in stable condition, Campos said. The ATV drive suffered minor injuries and was taken into custody, Campos said. ___ LOS ANGELES "" Police have arrested nearly 1,400 people in 17 U.S. cities as protests continue over the death of George Floyd. Floyd died Monday in Minnesota after a police officer put his knee on Floyd's neck for more than eight minutes. The officer was arrested Friday and charged with third-degree murder. But the arrest has done little to quell protests across the country. Most have been peaceful. But a few have erupted in violence. An Associated Press tally of arrests found at least 1,383 people have been arrested since Thursday. The actual number is likely higher as protests continue Saturday night. ___ WASHINGTON "" The National Guard has been called out in Washington, D.C., as pockets of violence erupted during a second straight night of protests over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis and President Donald Trump's reaction to it. Hundreds of protesters converged on the White House during the day Saturday and marched on the National Mall, chanting 'Black Lives Matter,' 'I can't breathe' and 'No justice, no peace.'

On Saturday, the president commended National Guard troops deployed in Minneapolis, declaring 'No games!' He also said police in New York City 'must be allowed to do their job!' In a tweet, Trump said: 'Let New York's Finest be New York's Finest.' He was commenting on Twitter from the White House while crowds of protesters gathered outside. ___ NASHVILLE, Tennessee "" The mayor of Nashville, Tennessee, has declared a state of civil emergency after protesters set a fire inside the Metro Courthouse in the state's capital city. Thousands had rallied near the Capitol building Saturday afternoon to peacefully protest police brutality and racism. But things turned violent after darkness fell, with protesters breaking windows in government buildings and causing other property damage. The Tennessean newspaper says demonstrators also pulled down a statue outside the Capitol of Edward Carmack, a controversial former lawmaker and newspaper publisher who espoused racist views. Police deployed tear gas and began warning demonstrators that the protest was unlawful. Gov. Bill Lee issued an order Saturday night for the National Guard to mobilize 'in response to protests that have now taken a violent, unlawful turn in Nashville.' ___ MINNEAPOLIS "" Police in Minneapolis are confronting protesters out after curfew on the fifth day of protests over the death of George Floyd. A group of marchers was moving north toward downtown on a city street when officers fired tear gas Saturday night. The group immediately retreated. Soon after, officers fired tear gas and moved in to push away throngs of protesters who were milling around the city police's 5th Precinct. The tougher tactics came after city and state leaders were criticized for not more strongly confronting violent and damaging protests. Minneapolis has been the epicenter of protests since the death Monday of Floyd after a police officer pressed his knee on Floyd's neck for some eight minutes. The protests have spread to cities across the United States. ___ CHICAGO "" Chicago's mayor has announced an overnight curfew in the city running from 9 p.m. Saturday until 6 a.m. Sunday, and she says police will crack down on any violence.

In the mayor's words: 'We can have zero tolerance for people who came prepared for a fight and tried to initiate and provoke our police department.' ___ MIAMI "" An initially peaceful protest in Miami over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis has turned violent, with some demonstrators setting fire to police cars. Witnesses to the clash Saturday say officers responded with tear gas and fireworks to disperse the crowd. The mayor has declared a 10 p.m. curfew. At one point, Interstate 95 was shut down as protesters stood on the busy highway. Police also used bicycles to push back an increasingly rowdy crowd throwing rocks.

Some broke into AT&T and Gold N Diamond stores. ___ Curfews are in effect or imminent in more than a dozen U.S. cities facing rising unrest following the death of George Floyd. The start times Saturday evening range from 6 p.m. in parts of South Carolina to 10 p.m. around Ohio. People are being told to get off the streets beginning at 8 p.m. or 9 p.m. in Atlanta, Denver, Los Angeles and Seattle. A curfew is in effect for a second night in and around Minneapolis, where Floyd died earlier this week after a police officer pressed his knee on Floyd's neck for more than eight minutes during an arrest. Thousands ignored the Friday night curfew and peaceful protests gave way to violence late into the night. ___ PHILADELPHIA "" Authorities in Philadelphia say a peaceful demonstration protesting the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis later turned violence, and at least 13 police officers have been injured amid incidents of arson and store break-ins in the city's doqwntown. Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw says at least four police vehicles were set ablaze and other fires were set throughout downtown Saturday afternoon. Protesters smashed windows and stole merchandise from stores as police tried to worked to corral the crowd, which Outlaw estimates numbered about 3,000. Protesters also sprayed graffiti on a statue of former Philadelphia Mayor Frank Rizzo, tried to topple it and set a fire at its base. Rizzo was Philadelphia's mayor from 1972 to 1980 and was praised by supporters as tough on crime but accused by critics of discriminating against minorities. Authorities in Philadelphia have ordered a citywide curfew has been implemented from 8 p.m. Saturday to 7 a.m. Sunday. ___ SALT LAKE CITY "" Utah Gov. Gary Herbert has activated the Utah National Guard after protesters angry over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis turned violent during a demonstration at which some participants carried rifles in Salt Lake City. Herbert says in a tweet that the Guard will help control 'the escalating situation' in the downtown area following the unrest Saturday afternoon. The protest started out peacefully, but degenerated into violence. A group of people flipped over a police car and lit it on fire. Some demonstrators smashed eggs and wrote graffiti on the walls of the Salt Lake City police station. Others marched through downtown to the state Capitol. Some people in the protest openly carried rifles, which is legal in Utah. ___ LOS ANGELES -- Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti has imposed a downtown curfew for Saturday night after some protests over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis turned violent. With protesters were back out Saturday, Garcetti said everyone must be off down town streets by 8 p.m. and stay away until 5:30 a.m. Several police cars were torched Saturday afternoon as some protesters ignored authorities' call for peaceful demonstrations. That followed a night of violence during which people smashed windows, robbed stores and set fires. Los Angeles police reported arresting 533 people during the night. ___ SEATTLE "" The Washington State Patrol has closed Interstate 5 in both directions through downtown Seattle after a protest over the death of George Floyd spilled onto the freeway. Thousands of people gathered in the downtown area Saturday for a largely peaceful demonstration, but some protesters turned rowdier as the afternoon worn on. Police used pepper spray on the demonstrators and deployed flash bang devices. Police said arrests were made but an exact figure wasn't available. State patrol Chief John Batiste said in a statement that 'the freeway is not a safe or appropriate place for demonstration.' ___ ATLANTA "" A crowd has gathered in Atlanta to protest the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis and some people have started throwing objects at officers guarding the Georgia governor's mansion. Hundreds of people stood on a residential sidewalk Saturday evening across the street from the mansion in the city's affluent Buckhead neighborhood. Cars and motorcyclists continued to sporadically drive by in front of the demonstrators. Authorities responded by taking at least one person into custody. Gov. Brian Kemp was not inside the home Saturday evening. Earlier in the day, Atlanta's mayor announced a curfew will be in effect in the city from 9 p.m. Saturday to sunrise Sunday. That order followed a night of violence that erupted in the city during demonstrations over Floyd's death. ___ MINNEAPOLIS "" Several Minneapolis City Council members are asking Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz to appoint the state's attorney general as a special prosecutor in the death of George Floyd. Six of the council's 13 members say they support a call from Floyd's family for Attorney General Keith Ellison to handle the prosecution of the police officer who held his knee on Floyd's neck Monday. The council members say they don't think Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman has the public trust necessary for the job. Freeman on Friday charged now-fired officer Derek Chauvin with third-degree murder in Floyd's death. Chauvin is white; Floyd was black. The council members say Freeman waited too long in bringing charge. They say Ellison, who is black, is best qualified to handle the case. They also cite a working group he helped lead on deaths involving police. ___ WASHINGTON "" Several hundred people shouting 'Black Lives Matter' and 'I can't breathe' have converged on the White House for a second straight day to protest the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis and President Donald Trump's response. Trump earlier on Saturday belittled the protesters and he pledged to 'stop mob violence.' Speaking in Florida after watching the launch of a SpaceX rocket, the president said: 'I stand before you as a friend and ally to every American seeking justice and peace, and I stand before you in firm opposition to anyone exploiting this tragedy to loot, rob, attack and menace. Healing, not hatred, justice, not chaos are the missions at hand.' Three lines of barricades separate protesters from a loose line of uniformed police officers at Lafayette Park, across from the White House. At one point, the protesters left the park, chanting as they marched up a nearby street. A block from the White House, they held a moment of silence and brief sit-in. ___ ATLANTA -- Atlanta's mayor has announced a curfew will be in effect from 9 p.m. Saturday to sunrise Sunday following violence that erupted in the city during demonstrations over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms announced the curfew during a news conference Saturday evening. She called it a 'very unusual and extreme step' after the violence that rocked Atlanta during Friday night. Several other cities across the nation have order curfews following unrest surrounding demonstrations protesting Floyd's death. Georgia's governor declared a state of emergency early Saturday to activate the state National Guard as violence flared in Atlanta. In Friday's protests, some demonstrators smashed police cars and spray-painted the iconic logo sign at CNN headquarters downtown. Police say at least three officers were hurt and there were multiple arrests as protesters shot at officers with BB guns and threw bricks, bottles and knives. Atlanta officials said crews were temporarily unable to reach a fire at a restaurant because of crowds of protesters. ___ NEW YORK "" Protesters angry over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis have returned to the streets of New York for a third straight day as Mayor Bill de Blasio pleads for calm after a demonstration in Brooklyn the previous night descended into chaos that left people bloodied and vehicles burned. On Saturday, a large crowd marched through Harlem, chanted outside a police precinct and then blocked traffic on the highway along Manhattan's East River. Demonstrations of several thousand at Union Square and outside Brooklyn's Prospect Park appeared mostly peaceful. Late in the day, protesters in Brooklyn confronted police, who shoved some of the demonstrators and used an irritating chemical spray. De Blasio expressed solidarity with demonstrators upset over police brutality, but promised an independent review of the Friday night confrontation in which both protesters and police officers engaged in violence. The mayor said he was upset by videos of the clashes in which 'protesters were handled very violently' by police and by reports that a state senator and member of the state Assembly were among the people sprayed with irritating chemicals by officers. ___ CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla "" President Donald Trump says he will not tolerate mob violence during demonstrations over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. The president made the comment as he spoke in Florida after watching the successful launch of a SpaceX rocket Saturday. He turned his attention to the unrest in American cities following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis before he congratulated NASA and others involved in the space mission. Trump says the rule of law is the crown jewel of the country and that 'my administration will stop mob violence and we'll stop it cold.' Trump says that 'I stand before you as a friend and ally to every American seeking justice and peace, and I stand before you in firm opposition to anyone exploiting this tragedy to loot, rob, attack and menace. Healing, not hatred. Justice not chaos are the missions at hand.'",0.0

Freeman on Friday charged now-fired officer Derek Chauvin with third-degree murder in Floyd's death. Chauvin is white; Floyd was black. The council members say Freeman waited too long in bringing charge. They say Ellison, who is black, is best qualified to handle the case. They also cite a working group he helped lead on deaths involving police. ___ WASHINGTON "" Several hundred people shouting 'Black Lives Matter' and 'I can't breathe' have converged on the White House for a second straight day to protest the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis and President Donald Trump's response. Trump earlier on Saturday belittled the protesters and he pledged to 'stop mob violence.' Speaking in Florida after watching the launch of a SpaceX rocket, the president said: 'I stand before you as a friend and ally to every American seeking justice and peace, and I stand before you in firm opposition to anyone exploiting this tragedy to loot, rob, attack and menace. Healing, not hatred, justice, not chaos are the missions at hand.' Three lines of barricades separate protesters from a loose line of uniformed police officers at Lafayette Park, across from the White House. At one point, the protesters left the park, chanting as they marched up a nearby street. A block from the White House, they held a moment of silence and brief sit-in. ___ ATLANTA -- Atlanta's mayor has announced a curfew will be in effect from 9 p.m. Saturday to sunrise Sunday following violence that erupted in the city during demonstrations over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms announced the curfew during a news conference Saturday evening. She called it a 'very unusual and extreme step' after the violence that rocked Atlanta during Friday night. Several other cities across the nation have order curfews following unrest surrounding demonstrations protesting Floyd's death. Georgia's governor declared a state of emergency early Saturday to activate the state National Guard as violence flared in Atlanta. In Friday's protests, some demonstrators smashed police cars and spray-painted the iconic logo sign at CNN headquarters downtown. Police say at least three officers were hurt and there were multiple arrests as protesters shot at officers with BB guns and threw bricks, bottles and knives. Atlanta officials said crews were temporarily unable to reach a fire at a restaurant because of crowds of protesters. ___ NEW YORK "" Protesters angry over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis have returned to the streets of New York for a third straight day as Mayor Bill de Blasio pleads for calm after a demonstration in Brooklyn the previous night descended into chaos that left people bloodied and vehicles burned. On Saturday, a large crowd marched through Harlem, chanted outside a police precinct and then blocked traffic on the highway along Manhattan's East River. Demonstrations of several thousand at Union Square and outside Brooklyn's Prospect Park appeared mostly peaceful. Late in the day, protesters in Brooklyn confronted police, who shoved some of the demonstrators and used an irritating chemical spray. De Blasio expressed solidarity with demonstrators upset over police brutality, but promised an independent review of the Friday night confrontation in which both protesters and police officers engaged in violence. The mayor said he was upset by videos of the clashes in which 'protesters were handled very violently' by police and by reports that a state senator and member of the state Assembly were among the people sprayed with irritating chemicals by officers. ___ CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla "" President Donald Trump says he will not tolerate mob violence during demonstrations over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. The president made the comment as he spoke in Florida after watching the successful launch of a SpaceX rocket Saturday. He turned his attention to the unrest in American cities following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis before he congratulated NASA and others involved in the space mission. Trump says the rule of law is the crown jewel of the country and that 'my administration will stop mob violence and we'll stop it cold.' Trump says that 'I stand before you as a friend and ally to every American seeking justice and peace, and I stand before you in firm opposition to anyone exploiting this tragedy to loot, rob, attack and menace. Healing, not hatred. Justice not chaos are the missions at hand.'",0.0

(WPRI) — Thousands attended a mainly peaceful protest in Providence Saturday afternoon, calling for justice for George Floyd, a black man killed by police in Minnesota on Monday. The rally, organized by Black Lives Matter Rhode Island, started at Burnside Park in Kennedy Plaza and moved to the steps of the State House where “No Justice, No Peace” was later spray-painted in black on the white marble. “Everyone is fed up,” said Paula Quigley, who attended the rally. “Not just black people. These are human beings.” Nationwide outrage has been fueled by a viral video showing former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin pinning Floyd down with his knee at Floyd’s neck until Floyd was unconscious. Floyd later died. Chauvin has since been arrested and charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Three other officers in the video have not been charged. “It’s got to stop,” said Brother Gary Dantzler, one of the organizers of Saturday’s event in Providence. “I’m sick to my stomach. We step back into time, we aren’t moving forward now.” In some places, protests have turned violent. In Boston, 10 people were arrested following a clash with police Friday night. Two officers were shot in Oakland, California. One of them later died. Providence’s rally was mostly peaceful. “I’m glad we are not looting and burning anything down,” Dantzler said. “I’m upset. I’m angry. But we are going to do it different here in Rhode Island. You know leadership is so important. When they see us, I want them to understand this was a peaceful rally because it’s a reflection of who we are as people.” Earlier this week, Eyewitness News talked to local community leaders about Floyd’s death and resulting protests, locally and across the country.

The shooting drew broad condemnations and revived complaints alleging excessive force by Israeli security forces. On social media, some compared the shooting to police violence in the U.S. Relatives identified the deceased man as Iyad Halak, 32. They said he suffered from autism and was heading to the school for students with special needs where he studied each day when he was shot. 'They killed him in cold blood,' Halak's mother, Rana, told Israel's Channel 12 TV. In a statement, Israeli police said they spotted a suspect 'with a suspicious object that looked like a pistol.' When he failed to obey orders to stop, officers opened fire, the statement said. Police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld later said no weapon was found. Channel 12 said members of Israel's paramilitary border police force fired at Halak's legs and chased him into a dead-end alley. It said a senior officer ordered a halt in fire as they entered the alley, but that a second officer did not listen and fired six or seven bullets from an M-16 rifle, killing Halak. The report said both officers were taken into custody and interrogated for several hours. AP video from the scene showed three bullet holes in a white wall at the end of the alleyway. Halak's father, Kheiri, said police raided the family's home after the shooting. 'They found nothing,' he said, claiming that police had cursed his daughter when she became upset at them. Lone Palestinian attackers with no clear links to armed groups have carried out a series of stabbings, shootings and car-ramming attacks in recent years. Palestinians and Israeli human rights groups have long accused Israeli security forces of using excessive force in some cases, either by killing individuals who could have been arrested or using lethal force when their lives were not in danger. 'We must resist the expected cover-up and make sure that the police will sit in jail,' Ayman Odeh, the leader of the main Arab party in parliament, wrote on Twitter. 'Justice will be done only when the Halak family, their friends and the rest of the Palestinian people know freedom and independence.' On social media, some pro-Palestinian activists compared the shooting to this week's killing of George Floyd, a handcuffed black Minnesota man who pleaded for air as a white police officer pressed a knee on his neck. His death has set off violent protests across the U.S. Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid, whose daughter is autistic, said Halak's death was 'heartbreaking.' 'The death of a young person with special needs is heartbreaking and all of Israel bows their heads. This is not our way,' he tweeted. In west Jerusalem, about 150 protesters, some pounding drums, gathered to demonstrate against police violence. 'A violent policeman must stay inside,' they chanted in Hebrew. At a smaller protest in Tel Aviv, one poster read 'Palestinian lives matter."" The shooting came a day after Israeli soldiers killed a Palestinian in the occupied West Bank who they said had tried to ram them with his vehicle. No Israelis were wounded in either incident. Saturday's shooting occurred in east Jerusalem, which Israel captured in the 1967 war along with the Israeli-occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip. The Palestinians want all three territories for their future state. Tensions have risen in recent weeks as Israel has pressed ahead with plans to annex large parts of the West Bank in line with President Donald Trump's Middle East plan, which strongly favors Israel and was rejected by the Palestinians. Netanyahu has said he plans on moving ahead with the plan in July. The Palestinian Authority, which governs autonomous enclaves in the West Bank, said last week that it was no longer bound by past agreements with Israel and the United States and was cutting off all ties, including longstanding security coordination, to protest the annexation plan. The Trump plan would allow the Palestinians to establish a capital on the outskirts of the city, beyond Israel's separation barrier. It would grant them limited statehood in a cluster of enclaves surrounded by Israel, but only if they meet a long list of stringent conditions. The annexation plan has also drawn widespread condemnations from Israeli allies in Europe and across the Arab world.",0.0

He worked with the city's booming business community and the City Council. He reached out to minority neighborhoods and advocated for affordable housing. He implemented stricter disciplinary measures against police who violated the city's body camera policy. When George Floyd, a handcuffed black man, died Monday after a white police officer pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes and ignored his 'I can't breathe' pleas, Frey quickly expressed outrage and called for charges against the officer. Four officers were fired the next day, and on Friday, Officer Derek Chauvin was charged in Floyd's death. But Frey's leadership is being questioned after police failed to quell several nights of rioting, fires and ransacking of local businesses that followed Floyd's death. Frey, who pleaded for calm, also approved the decision to abandon the city's 3rd Precinct station on Thursday night, surrendering it to protesters who set fire to the building. The night the station burned, Frey appeared at an early-morning news conference after hours of criticism on social media for a police response that didn't confront the violence despite the activation of the National Guard. As he began talking, one reporter snapped, 'What's the plan here?' Frey struggled to answer, and the next morning, Gov. Tim Walz "" like Frey, a Democrat "" criticized the 'abject failure' of the city's response and said the state had taken control. President Donald Trump took to Twitter to call Frey a 'very weak Radical Left Mayor' and threatened to get involved. By early Saturday morning, it was Walz who found himself struggling with the enormity of the challenge, conceding that he didn't have enough people to cope with the protests and moving to mobilize another 1,000 Guard members. Walz also took pains to praise Frey, who appeared alongside him after another night of unrest. Some wonder whether Frey's approach to the crisis might damage his chances for reelection next year. The 38-year-old former lawyer, community organizer and one-term City Council member took office in 2018 after defeating Betsy Hodges, whose time as mayor was marred by two high-profile police shootings. The 2015 shooting of 24-year-old black resident Jamar Clark after a scuffle with two white police officers set off weeks of protests; neither officer was charged. The 2017 shooting of unarmed Australia native Justine Ruszczyk Damond, who had called 911 to report a possible sexual assault behind her house, provoked an international outcry. The black officer in that case was convicted of third-degree murder and is serving a 12 1/2-year term. Frey campaigned partly on a promise to add police officers. But a City Council committee this spring voted against applying for a federal grant to hire 10 new officers for traffic enforcement, with one member saying he worried it would exacerbate racial disparities in vehicle stops. Community activist Mel Reeves, who said he has led rallies to protest Floyd's killing, refused to discuss the mayor's response except to say that Frey had been 'put in a difficult position.' He said the black community doesn't trust police and prosecutors to do the right thing. 'The mayor is new, and he said all the right things,"" Reeves said. 'This is not about the mayor; it's about the police department.' The day after the 3rd Precinct fire, University of Minnesota political science professor Larry Jacobs said Frey was 'out of his depth' and ""clearly unable to understand what he has to do to restore order while also creating the kind of healing that has to happen in Minneapolis.' He said abandoning the police station 'sent a powerful message' that the city was not in control. 'There needs to be another message: 'Here is the line and order will be maintained,'' said Jacobs. ""You've got businesses that are just shocked without words to see property going up in flames, often with no police intervention at all. You have the black community (that has) heard his words but does not believe them. 'He worked really hard at those relationships and they appear to be in tatters. And I think a lot of residents are unnerved by the violence and the chaos.' Jonathan Weinhagen, president and CEO of the Minneapolis Regional Chamber, said the mayor still has his support, and that many businesses damaged by the violent protests, including those owned by minorities and immigrants, want to rebuild. 'There is a lot of fear right now. If your store has been hit, you feel violated,' said Weinhagen, adding that some businesses already were suffering because of the coronavirus restrictions. 'They were just beginning to see some light and this hit.' But he believes the mayor is 'leading with his values"" and getting a lot of things right, including requesting the Guard assistance and implementing a curfew Friday and Saturday nights. Jacobs, the political scientist, said Frey has been energetic, upbeat and dynamic, effectively leading the fast-growing city. But his inexperience with crisis management has shown. 'Until about a week ago, he looked to be on glide path to reelection, and within a week, his mayorship looks like it's crumbled,"" Jacobs said. ___ Webber reported from Fenton, Michigan.",0.0

The Palestinian Authority, which governs autonomous enclaves in the West Bank, said last week that it was no longer bound by past agreements with Israel and the United States and was cutting off all ties, including longstanding security coordination, to protest the annexation plan. The Trump plan would allow the Palestinians to establish a capital on the outskirts of the city, beyond Israel's separation barrier. It would grant them limited statehood in a cluster of enclaves surrounded by Israel, but only if they meet a long list of stringent conditions. The annexation plan has also drawn widespread condemnations from Israeli allies in Europe and across the Arab world.",0.0

He worked with the city's booming business community and the City Council. He reached out to minority neighborhoods and advocated for affordable housing. He implemented stricter disciplinary measures against police who violated the city's body camera policy. When George Floyd, a handcuffed black man, died Monday after a white police officer pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes and ignored his 'I can't breathe' pleas, Frey quickly expressed outrage and called for charges against the officer. Four officers were fired the next day, and on Friday, Officer Derek Chauvin was charged in Floyd's death. But Frey's leadership is being questioned after police failed to quell several nights of rioting, fires and ransacking of local businesses that followed Floyd's death. Frey, who pleaded for calm, also approved the decision to abandon the city's 3rd Precinct station on Thursday night, surrendering it to protesters who set fire to the building. The night the station burned, Frey appeared at an early-morning news conference after hours of criticism on social media for a police response that didn't confront the violence despite the activation of the National Guard. As he began talking, one reporter snapped, 'What's the plan here?' Frey struggled to answer, and the next morning, Gov. Tim Walz "" like Frey, a Democrat "" criticized the 'abject failure' of the city's response and said the state had taken control. President Donald Trump took to Twitter to call Frey a 'very weak Radical Left Mayor' and threatened to get involved. By early Saturday morning, it was Walz who found himself struggling with the enormity of the challenge, conceding that he didn't have enough people to cope with the protests and moving to mobilize another 1,000 Guard members. Walz also took pains to praise Frey, who appeared alongside him after another night of unrest. Some wonder whether Frey's approach to the crisis might damage his chances for reelection next year. The 38-year-old former lawyer, community organizer and one-term City Council member took office in 2018 after defeating Betsy Hodges, whose time as mayor was marred by two high-profile police shootings. The 2015 shooting of 24-year-old black resident Jamar Clark after a scuffle with two white police officers set off weeks of protests; neither officer was charged. The 2017 shooting of unarmed Australia native Justine Ruszczyk Damond, who had called 911 to report a possible sexual assault behind her house, provoked an international outcry. The black officer in that case was convicted of third-degree murder and is serving a 12 1/2-year term. Frey campaigned partly on a promise to add police officers. But a City Council committee this spring voted against applying for a federal grant to hire 10 new officers for traffic enforcement, with one member saying he worried it would exacerbate racial disparities in vehicle stops. Community activist Mel Reeves, who said he has led rallies to protest Floyd's killing, refused to discuss the mayor's response except to say that Frey had been 'put in a difficult position.' He said the black community doesn't trust police and prosecutors to do the right thing. 'The mayor is new, and he said all the right things,"" Reeves said. 'This is not about the mayor; it's about the police department.' The day after the 3rd Precinct fire, University of Minnesota political science professor Larry Jacobs said Frey was 'out of his depth' and ""clearly unable to understand what he has to do to restore order while also creating the kind of healing that has to happen in Minneapolis.' He said abandoning the police station 'sent a powerful message' that the city was not in control. 'There needs to be another message: 'Here is the line and order will be maintained,'' said Jacobs. ""You've got businesses that are just shocked without words to see property going up in flames, often with no police intervention at all. You have the black community (that has) heard his words but does not believe them. 'He worked really hard at those relationships and they appear to be in tatters. And I think a lot of residents are unnerved by the violence and the chaos.' Jonathan Weinhagen, president and CEO of the Minneapolis Regional Chamber, said the mayor still has his support, and that many businesses damaged by the violent protests, including those owned by minorities and immigrants, want to rebuild. 'There is a lot of fear right now. If your store has been hit, you feel violated,' said Weinhagen, adding that some businesses already were suffering because of the coronavirus restrictions. 'They were just beginning to see some light and this hit.' But he believes the mayor is 'leading with his values"" and getting a lot of things right, including requesting the Guard assistance and implementing a curfew Friday and Saturday nights. Jacobs, the political scientist, said Frey has been energetic, upbeat and dynamic, effectively leading the fast-growing city. But his inexperience with crisis management has shown. 'Until about a week ago, he looked to be on glide path to reelection, and within a week, his mayorship looks like it's crumbled,"" Jacobs said. ___ Webber reported from Fenton, Michigan.",0.0
1621142081,2020-05-30 14:35:07,Israeli forces kill unarmed autistic Palestinian man,https://www.newportri.com/ZZ/news/20200530/israeli-forces-kill-unarmed-autistic-palestinian-man?rssfeed=true,en,True,,662951,Newport Life,http://www.newportlifemagazine.com/,"JERUSALEM (AP) "" Israeli police shot dead an unarmed autistic Palestinian man in Jerusalem's Old City on Saturday after saying they suspected he was carrying a weapon. The shooting drew broad condemnations and revived complaints alleging excessive force by Israeli security forces. On social media, some compared the shooting to police violence in the U.S. Relatives identified the deceased man as Iyad Halak, 32. They said he suffered from autism and was heading to the school for students with special needs where he studied each day when he was shot. 'They killed him in cold blood,' Halak's mother, Rana, told Israel's Channel 12 TV. In a statement, Israeli police said they spotted a suspect 'with a suspicious object that looked like a pistol.' When he failed to obey orders to stop, officers opened fire, the statement said. Police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld later said no weapon was found. Channel 12 said members of Israel's paramilitary border police force fired at Halak's legs and chased him into a dead-end alley. It said a senior officer ordered a halt in fire as they entered the alley, but that a second officer did not listen and fired six or seven bullets from an M-16 rifle, killing Halak. The report said both officers were taken into custody and interrogated for several hours. AP video from the scene showed three bullet holes in a white wall at the end of the alleyway. Halak's father, Kheiri, said police raided the family's home after the shooting. 'They found nothing,' he said, claiming that police had cursed his daughter when she became upset at them. Lone Palestinian attackers with no clear links to armed groups have carried out a series of stabbings, shootings and car-ramming attacks in recent years. Palestinians and Israeli human rights groups have long accused Israeli security forces of using excessive force in some cases, either by killing individuals who could have been arrested or using lethal force when their lives were not in danger. 'We must resist the expected cover-up and make sure that the police will sit in jail,' Ayman Odeh, the leader of the main Arab party in parliament, wrote on Twitter. 'Justice will be done only when the Halak family, their friends and the rest of the Palestinian people know freedom and independence.' On social media, some pro-Palestinian activists compared the shooting to this week's killing of George Floyd, a handcuffed black Minnesota man who pleaded for air as a white police officer pressed a knee on his neck. His death has set off violent protests across the U.S. Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid, whose daughter is autistic, said Halak's death was 'heartbreaking.' 'The death of a young person with special needs is heartbreaking and all of Israel bows their heads. This is not our way,' he tweeted. In west Jerusalem, about 150 protesters, some pounding drums, gathered to demonstrate against police violence. 'A violent policeman must stay inside,' they chanted in Hebrew. At a smaller protest in Tel Aviv, one poster read 'Palestinian lives matter."" The shooting came a day after Israeli soldiers killed a Palestinian in the occupied West Bank who they said had tried to ram them with his vehicle. No Israelis were wounded in either incident. Saturday's shooting occurred in east Jerusalem, which Israel captured in the 1967 war along with the Israeli-occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip. The Palestinians want all three territories for their future state. Tensions have risen in recent weeks as Israel has pressed ahead with plans to annex large parts of the West Bank in line with President Donald Trump's Middle East plan, which strongly favors Israel and was rejected by the Palestinians. Netanyahu has said he plans on moving ahead with the plan in July.

But the state and federal officials have offered differing assessments of who the outsiders are. They've blamed left-wing extremists, far-right white nationalists and even suggested the involvement of drug cartels. These leaders have offered little evidence to back up those claims, and the chaos of the protests makes verifying identities and motives exceedingly difficult. Police officers across the country were gearing up Saturday for another night of potentially violent clashes in major cities. Some states had even called in the National Guard to aid overwhelmed police. The finger pointing on both sides of the political spectrum is likely to deepen the political divide in the U.S., allowing politicians to advance the theory that aligns with their political view and distract from the underlying frustrations that triggered the protests. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz on Saturday told reporters he'd heard unconfirmed reports that white supremacists were coming from elsewhere to stoke the violence and that even drug cartels 'are trying to take advantage of the chaos.' John Harrington, the state's commissioner of public safety, later said they had received intel reports on white supremacists.

A Justice Department spokesperson said the attorney general's assertion was based on information provided from state and local law enforcement agencies, but did not detail what that information entailed. Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf was even more vague, declining to point to any particular ideology in his assessment.

Carter expressed the opinion of many black activists in the Twin Cities who have expressed disbelief that local residents would destroy their own neighborhoods, burning down essential services and damaging small businesses.

1621235662,2020-05-30 20:37:59,Officials blame differing groups of 'outsiders' for violence,https://www.providencejournal.com/ZZ/news/20200530/officials-blame-differing-groups-of-outsiders-for-violence?rssfeed=true,en,True,,68874,providencejournal.com,http://www.providencejournal.com/#spider,"WASHINGTON (AP) "" As protests over the death of George Floyd grow in cities across the U.S., government officials have been warning of the 'outsiders' -- groups of organized rioters they say are flooding into major cities not to call for justice but to cause destruction. But the state and federal officials have offered differing assessments of who the outsiders are. They've blamed left-wing extremists, far-right white nationalists and even suggested the involvement of drug cartels. These leaders have offered little evidence to back up those claims, and the chaos of the protests makes verifying identities and motives exceedingly difficult. Police officers across the country were gearing up Saturday for another night of potentially violent clashes in major cities. Some states had even called in the National Guard to aid overwhelmed police. The finger pointing on both sides of the political spectrum is likely to deepen the political divide in the U.S., allowing politicians to advance the theory that aligns with their political view and distract from the underlying frustrations that triggered the protests. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz on Saturday told reporters he'd heard unconfirmed reports that white supremacists were coming from elsewhere to stoke the violence and that even drug cartels 'are trying to take advantage of the chaos.' John Harrington, the state's commissioner of public safety, later said they had received intel reports on white supremacists. 'But I cannot say that we have confirmed observations of local law enforcement to say that we've seen cells of white supremacists in the area,' he said Saturday. But federal officials later pointed 'far left extremist groups."" President Donald Trump alleged the violence was 'being led by Antifa and other radical groups.' Antifa, short for anti-fascists, is an umbrella term for far-left-leaning militant groups that resist neo-Nazis and white supremacists at demonstrations. Attorney General William Barr later seemed to echo Trump's assertion, saying the violent incidents in Minneapolis were driven by groups using ""Antifa-like tactics."" Barr vowed that federal prosecutors across the country would use federal riots statutes to charge protesters who cross state lines to participate in violent rioting. A Justice Department spokesperson said the attorney general's assertion was based on information provided from state and local law enforcement agencies, but did not detail what that information entailed. Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf was even more vague, declining to point to any particular ideology in his assessment. His agency has heard that 'a number of different groups are involved in these whether it's Antifa or it's others, frankly,"" he said. The groups appeared to be organized and using tactics that wouldn't normally happen in peaceful protest, he said, though he didn't elaborate. While the motives behind the violence was unclear, there was firmer evidence that some of the protesters were coming to the demonstrations from outside the urban centers that have been the epicenter of the demonstrations. In New York City, federal officials were bringing charges against several suspects, including one of two sisters from upstate New York accused of throwing a Molotov cocktail through the back window of a police van in Brooklyn, a law enforcement official said. The initially peaceful demonstrations in New York City over Floyd's death spiraled into chaos as night fell Friday. Protester confronted police officers, destroying police vehicles and setting fires. In Detroit, 37 of the 60 people who were arrested in overnight protests did not live in the city "" and many came from nearby suburbs, police Chief James Craig said Saturday. Although Detroit is about 80% black, many of those arrested were white. 'We support the right to free speech. We support peaceful protests,' Craig told reporters. 'If you want to disrupt, stay home and disrupt in your own community.' St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter said Saturday he'd been told all of those arrested in his city Friday were from outside the state. 'What we are seeing right now is a group of people who are not from here,' he said.

1621293341,2020-05-30 22:40:12,Protests over police killings rage on in dozens of US cities,https://www.newportri.com/ZZ/news/20200530/protests-over-police-killings-rage-on-in-dozens-of-us-cities?rssfeed=true,en,True,,662951,Newport Life,http://www.newportlifemagazine.com/,"MINNEAPOLIS (AP) "" Tense protests over the death of George Floyd and other police killings of black people grew Saturday from New York to Tulsa to Los Angeles, with police cars set ablaze and reports of injuries mounting on all sides as the country convulsed through another night of unrest after months of coronavirus lockdowns. The protests, which began in Minneapolis following Floyd's death Monday after a police officer pressed a knee on his neck until he stopped breathing, have left parts of the city a grid of broken windows, burned-out buildings and ransacked stores. The unrest has since become a national phenomenon as protesters decry years of deaths at police hands. Tens of thousands of people were in the streets across the country, many of them not wearing masks or observing social distancing, raising concerns among health experts about the potential for spreading the coronavirus pandemic at a time when much of the country is in the process of reopening society and the economy. After a tumultuous Friday, racially diverse crowds held mostly peaceful demonstrations in dozens of cities, though many later descended into violence as had happened the previous night. Few corners of America were untouched, from protesters setting fires inside Reno's city hall, to police launching tear gas at rock-throwing demonstrators in Fargo, North Dakota, to shattered windows at police headquarters in Richmond, Virginia. "" In Indianapolis, police were investigating 'multiple shootings' downtown, including one that left a person dead, amid the protests. Police gave few details but said no officers were involved. "" In Washington, the National Guard was deployed outside the White House, where chanting crowds taunted law enforcement officers. Dressed in camouflage and holding shields, the troops stood in a tight line a few yards from the crowd, preventing them from pushing forward. President Donald Trump, who spent much of Saturday in Florida for the SpaceX rocket launch, landed on the lawn in the presidential helicopter at dusk and went inside without speaking to journalists. "" In Philadelphia, at least 13 officers were injured when peaceful protests turned violent and at least four police vehicles were set on fire. Other fires were set throughout downtown. "" In Salt Lake City, protesters defied a curfew and National Guard troops were deployed by Utah's governor. Demonstrators flipped a police car and lit it on fire, and another vehicle was later set ablaze. Police said six people were arrested and a police officer was injured after being struck in the head with a baseball bat. "" In Los Angeles, protesters chanted 'Black Lives Matter,' some within inches of the face shields of officers. Police used batons to move the crowd back and fired rubber bullets. A graffiti-covered police car burned in the street. "" And in New York City, dangerous confrontations flared repeatedly as officers made arrests and cleared streets. A video showed two NYPD cruisers lurching into a crowd of demonstrators who were pushing a barricade against one of them and pelting it with objects. Several people were knocked to the ground, and it was unclear if anyone was hurt. 'The mistakes that are happening are not mistakes. They're repeated violent terrorist offenses and people need to stop killing black people,"" Brooklyn protester Meryl Makielski said. Not all protests devolved into violence. In Juneau, Alaska, law enforcement officers joined elected officials and residents at a peaceful protest in front of a giant whale sculpture on the city's waterfront. 'We don't tolerate excessive use of force,' Juneau Police Chief Ed Mercer told the gathering. Back in Minneapolis, the city where the protests began, police, state troopers and National Guard members moved in soon after an 8 p.m. curfew took effect to break up protests, firing tear gas and rubber bullets to clear streets outside a police precinct and elsewhere. The show of force came after three days when police largely avoided engaging protesters, and after the state poured in more than 4,000 National Guard troops to Minneapolis and said the number would soon rise to nearly 11,000. 'The situation in Minneapolis is no longer in any way about the murder of George Floyd,' said Gov. Tim Walz, who also said local forces had been overmatched the previous day. 'It is about attacking civil society, instilling fear and disrupting our great cities.' Minneapolis' streets steadily grew calmer as the night went on, and Corrections Commissioner Paul Schnell said the tough response would remain as long as it takes to 'quell this situation.' Some residents were glad to see the upheaval dissipating. 'l live here. I haven't been able to sleep,"" said Iman Muhammad, whose neighborhood saw multiple fires set Friday night. Muhammad said she sympathized with peaceful protests over Floyd's death but disagreed with the violence: 'Wrong doesn't answer wrong."" Trump appeared to cheer on the tougher tactics Saturday night, commending the Guard deployment in Minneapolis, declaring 'No games!' and saying police in New York City 'must be allowed to do their job!' Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden condemned the violence as he continued to express common cause with those demonstrating after Floyd's death. 'The act of protesting should never be allowed to overshadow the reason we protest,' Biden said in a statement Saturday night. Overnight curfews were imposed in more than a dozen major cities nationwide, including Atlanta, Denver, Los Angeles, Minneapolis and Seattle. More than 1,300 people have been arrested in 16 cities since Thursday, including over 500 Friday in Los Angeles. The unrest comes at a time when most Americans have spent months inside over concerns surrounding the coronavirus, which the president has called an 'invisible enemy.' The events of the last 72 hours, seen live on national television, have shown the opposite: a sudden pivot to crowds, screaming protesters and burning buildings, and a stark contrast to the empty streets of recent months. 'Quite frankly I'm ready to just lock people up,"" Atlanta Police Chief Erika Shields said at a news conference. Demonstrations there turned violent Friday, and police were arresting protesters Saturday on blocked-off downtown streets. 'Yes, you caught us off balance once. It's not going to happen twice.' This week's unrest recalled the riots in Los Angeles nearly 30 years ago after the acquittal of the white police officers who beat Rodney King, a black motorist who had led them on a high-speed chase. The protests of Floyd's killing have gripped many more cities, but the losses in Minneapolis have yet to approach the staggering totals Los Angeles saw during five days of rioting in 1992, when more than 60 people died, 2,000-plus were injured and thousands arrested, with property damage topping $1 billion. Many protesters spoke of frustration that Floyd's death was one more in a litany. It came in the wake of the killing in Georgia of Ahmaud Arbery, a black man who was shot dead after being pursued by two white men while running in their neighborhood, and in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic that has thrown millions out of work, killed more than 100,000 people in the U.S. and disproportionately affected black people. The officer who held his knee to Floyd's neck as he begged for air was arrested Friday and charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. But many protesters are demanding the arrests of the three other officers involved. Trump stoked the anger on Twitter, saying that if protesters had breached the White House fence, they would 'have been greeted with the most vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons, I have ever seen.' Leaders in many affected cities have voiced outrage over Floyd's killing and expressed sympathy for protesters' concerns. But as the unrest intensified, they spoke of a desperate need to protect their cities and said they would call in reinforcements, despite concerns that could lead to more heavy-handed tactics. Governors in Georgia, Kentucky, Ohio and Texas also activated the National Guard after protests there turned violent. Police in St. Louis were investigating the death of a protester who climbed between two trailers of a Fed Ex truck and was killed when it drove away. And a person was killed in the area of protests in downtown Detroit just before midnight after someone fired shots into an SUV, officers said. Police had initially said someone fired into the crowd from an SUV. ___ Numerous AP journalists contributed from across the U.S.",0.0

1621298791,2020-05-30 15:49:51,"""We are tired' say hundreds in rally against killing of George Floyd",https://www.providencejournal.com/news/20200530/we-are-tired-say-hundreds-in-rally-against-killing-of-george-floyd?rssfeed=true,en,False,,68874,providencejournal.com,http://www.providencejournal.com/#spider,"PROVIDENCE — A chorus of nearly 1,000 voices shouted George Floyd’s name from the State House lawn on Saturday in memory of the black man who died while being restrained by white police officers in Minneapolis this week, and in protest of police violence against black people across the country. “I’m tired of watching young black, brown, beautiful people dying,” said Gary Dantzler, an activist with Black Lives Matter Rhode Island, the group that organized Saturday’s rally. “White supremacy, we gotta end it.” Protests broke out in cities across the country this week after a video — showing a white officer kneeling on Floyd’s neck until his body went limp — spread across the internet. The officer, Derek Chauvin, has been charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. Three other officers who were on scene at the time were fired from the Minneapolis Police Department but have yet to be charged. Protesters who gathered in Burnside Park on Saturday before marching to the State House said they felt angry and heartbroken over Floyd’s death and exhausted by the repeated killings of black people by police in America. The killings of Ahmaud Arbery, a 25-year-old unarmed black man who was shot while jogging in Glynn County, Georgia, and Breonna Taylor, a black woman who was shot while she was sleeping in her apartment in Louisville, Kentucky, have also sparked protests recently. “Year in and year out, nothing changes as far as the criminal justice system in this country,” said Shawn Holloway, 40, of Pawtucket, who held a “Black Lives Matter Rhode Island” sign over his head by the fountain in Burnside Park. “Black men and women are looked at as second-class citizens, and to this day we have to earn our right to be equal.” Protesters, most of whom wore face masks and carried signs, chanted, “No justice, no peace,” “black lives matter,” and “I can’t breathe” in reference to Floyd, who repeatedly told the officer kneeling on his neck that he couldn’t breathe. The phrase became a rallying cry for the Black Lives Matter movement after Eric Garner, a black man killed by police in New York in 2014, said “I can’t breathe” as white officers held him in a chokehold. “We are tired,” said Matt Williams, 33, of North Providence. “We are tired of being disrespected. We are tired of being looked over. We are ready for change.” The novel coronavirus pandemic and the social-distancing measures put in place to help mitigate transmission of the virus didn’t deter protesters from gathering on Saturday. “I want to stay safe because of coronavirus, but at the same time, this is bigger than coronavirus,” said Williams, who wore a black bandanna over his nose and mouth. “This is something that’s been going on forever. … I’m ready to stand for what I believe in and because of that, coronavirus or anything else, I’m going to be out here, front lines, standing for black people.” While protests in other cities have resulted in looting, rioting and violence in some cases, Saturday’s rally in Providence was peaceful. As she walked with other protesters from Burnside Park to the State House, Ridgshana Nonau, 21, of Providence, said that she is studying to become a detective so that she can represent the black community within the criminal justice system. “I’m putting myself out there so I can be one of the good ones that can bring peace and can change everything that’s happening,” she said. Watching the video of Floyd’s killing, she said, brought her to tears. “Literally, my heart just broke,” she said. “I cried and I was speechless. … I’m tired of it. This is not the first time. And I want it to be the last time.”",0.0
1621298790,2020-05-30 16:49:48,SpaceX rocket ship blasts into orbit with 2 Americans aboard,https://www.providencejournal.com/news/20200530/spacex-rocket-ship-blasts-into-orbit-with-2-americans-aboard?rssfeed=true,en,False,,68874,providencejournal.com,http://www.providencejournal.com/#spider,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. — A rocket ship built by Elon Musk's SpaceX company thundered away from Earth with two Americans on Saturday, ushering in a new era in commercial space travel and putting the United States back in the business of launching astronauts into orbit from U.S. soil for the first time in nearly a decade. NASA's Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken rode skyward aboard a white-and-black, bullet-shaped Dragon capsule on top of a Falcon 9 rocket, lifting off at 3:22 p.m. from the same launch pad used to send Apollo crews to the moon a half-century ago. Minutes later, they slipped safely into orbit. ""Let's light this candle,"" Hurley said just before ignition, borrowing the words used by Alan Shepard on America's first human spaceflight, in 1961. The two men are scheduled to arrive at the International Space Station, 250 miles above Earth, on Sunday to join the three crew members already there. After a stay of up to four months, they will come home with a Right Stuff-style splashdown at sea, something the world hasn't witnessed since the 1970s. The mission unfolded amid the gloom of the coronavirus outbreak, which has killed more than 100,000 Americans, and racial unrest across the U.S. over the death of George Floyd, a handcuffed black man, at the hands of Minneapolis police. NASA officials and others held out hope the flight would lift American spirits. ""Maybe there's an opportunity here for America to maybe pause and look up and see a bright, shining moment of hope at what the future looks like, that the United States of America can do extraordinary things even in difficult times,"" NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine said before launch. Doug Marshburn, of Deltona, Florida, shouted: ""USA! USA!"" as the 260-foot rocket climbed skyward. ""I'm very proud of the United States. We are back in the game. It's very satisfying,"" he said. With the on-time liftoff, SpaceX became the first private company to launch people into orbit, a feat achieved previously by only three governments: the U.S., Russia and China. The flight also ended a nine-year launch drought for NASA. Ever since it retired the space shuttle in 2011, NASA has relied on Russian spaceships launched from Kazakhstan to take U.S. astronauts to and from the space station. In the intervening years, NASA outsourced the job of designing and building its next generation of spaceships to SpaceX and Boeing, awarding them $7 billion in contracts in a public-private partnership aimed at driving down costs and spurring innovation. Boeing's spaceship, the Starliner capsule, is not expected to fly astronauts until early 2021. NASA hopes to rely in part on commercial partners as it pursues it next goals: sending astronauts back to the moon in the next few years, and on to Mars in the 2030s. Musk, the visionary who is also behind the Tesla electric car company, had no immediate comment on the successful liftoff. A launch attempt on Wednesday was called off with less than 17 minutes to go in the countdown because of lightning. On Saturday, stormy weather threatened another postponement for most of the day, but then the skies began to clear just in time. The astronauts set out for the launch pad in a gull-wing Tesla SUV after Behnken pantomimed a hug of his 6-year-old son, Theo, and said: ""Are you going to listen to Mommy and make her life easy?"" Hurley blew kisses to his 10-year-old son and his wife. Nine minutes after liftoff, the rocket's first-stage booster landed, as designed, on a barge a few hundred miles off the Florida coast, to be reused on another flight. ""Thanks for the great ride to space,"" Hurley told SpaceX ground control. His crewmate batted around a sparkly purplish toy, demonstrating that they had reached zero gravity. SpaceX controllers at Hawthorne, California, cheered and applauded wildly. Bridenstine declared: ""This is everything that America has to offer in its purest form."" ""It's been nine years since we've launched American astronauts on American rockets from American soil — and now it's done. We have done it. It's been way too long,"" he said. President Donald Trump, who came to Florida to watch along with Vice President Mike Pence, said: ""I'm so proud of the people at NASA, all the people that worked together, public and private. When you see a sight like that, it's incredible."" Attendance inside Kennedy Space Center was strictly limited because of the coronavirus, and the crowd amounted to only a few thousand. By NASA's count, more than3 million viewers tuned in online. Despite NASA's insistence that the public stay safe by staying home, spectators gathered along beaches and roads hours in advance. Among them was Neil Wight, a machinist from Buffalo, New York, who staked out a view of the launch pad from a park in Titusville. ""It's pretty historically significant in my book, and a lot of other people's books. With everything that's going on in this country right now, it's important that we do things extraordinary in life,"" Wight said. ""We've been bombarded with doom and gloom for the last six, eight weeks, whatever it is, and this is awesome. It brings a lot of people together."" Because of the coronavirus, the astronauts were kept in quasi-quarantine for more than two months. The SpaceX technicians who helped them get into their spacesuits wore masks and gloves that made them look like black-clad ninjas. And at the launch center, the SpaceX controllers wore masks and were seated far apart. In keeping with Musk's penchant for futuristic flash, the astronauts wore angular white uniforms with black trim. Instead of the usual multitude of dials, knobs and switches, the Dragon capsule has three large touchscreens. SpaceX has been launching cargo capsules to the space station since 2012. In preparation for Saturday's flight, SpaceX sent up a Dragon capsule with only a test dummy aboard last year, and it docked smoothly at the orbiting outpost on autopilot, then returned to Earth in a splashdown.",0.0

Twenty-five cars paraded through the ACI grounds, stopping outside the prison units and the Rhode Island Training School to express solidarity with the prisoners. TO OUR READERS: This content is being provided for free as a public service during the coronavirus outbreak. Sign up for our daily or breaking newsletters to stay informed. Please support local journalism by subscribing to The Providence Journal. “Knock it Off,” “COVID 23-plus hour lockdown is torture,” “Decarcerate Now,” “No COVID capital punishment,” and “Black Lives Matter” read the signs of those participating in the “noise demonstration” Saturday afternoon. They were both led and tailed by sedans driven by state Department of Corrections staff. The demands included immediately ending the policy of keeping inmates in their cells 23 hours a day, and publicly releasing the state’s plan to restore educational programming, visitation and socially distanced recreation time. A notice on the Corrections Department’s Facebook page on Friday announced that it is “working to establish video visitation, which we hope to have up and running soon. We hope this will allow for you to see and speak with your loved ones sooner rather than later. We look forward to continuing to work with public health experts to further expand visitation as soon as it is safe to do so.” Other demands included finding budget savings reducing the prison population; implementing geriatric parole for those older than 50; and increasing testing, even for asymptomatic inmates. They demanded, too, an end to “price gouging” for commissary goods and a $3 daily stipend for prisoners who are no longer able to work due to COVID-19 restrictions. “RIDOC has no higher priority than the safety of those who work and live here. When it comes to addressing the COVID-19 crisis, not only are everyone’s constitutional rights respected, but RIDOC’s positive results speak for themselves,” corrections spokesman J.R. Ventura said in an emailed statement. “As of today, our positive test count stands at 14 staff members and four sentenced inmates, making us one of the safest correctional institutions in the country. That is a fact that every Rhode Islander can be proud of. … Our safety planning and proactive approach thus far have yielded positive results, and we will continue to work hard to keep people safe.” The department plans to continue daily updates on Facebook to keep the public informed of its efforts and the coronavirus statistics, he said. Seven transient prisoners, who were not yet sentenced, also tested positive at the prison, according to the data. By comparison, a total of 47 inmates at the Donald W. Wyatt Detention Facility in Central Falls have tested positive, and 27 of those remain active cases. Fourteen staff members have also tested positive, with 12 cases remaining active. Groups participating in Saturday’s protest included Alliance to Mobilize Our Resistance, Sunrise Providence, Formerly Incarcerated Union of Rhode Island, Providence Democratic Socialists of America, Black & Pink Providence, Direct Action for Rights and Equality, and more than a dozen others. — kmulvane@providencejournal.com (401) 277-7417 On Twitter: @kmulvane",0.0

A day that began with mostly peaceful marches through Harlem and neighborhoods in the Bronx, Brooklyn and Queens descended into chaos as night fell. Demonstrators smashed windows, hurled objects at officers, torched and battered police vehicles and blocked roads with garbage and wreckage. A handful of stores in Manhattan had their windows broken and merchandise stolen. Officers sprayed crowds with chemicals, and video showed two police cruisers lurching into a crowd of demonstrators on a Brooklyn street, knocking several to the ground, after people attacked it with thrown objects, including something on fire. It was unclear whether anyone was hurt It was the third straight day of protests in the city over the killing of George Floyd by a police officer in Minnesota, a remarkable outburst after most New Yorkers spent the past two months stuck inside as the coronavirus devastated the city. A night earlier, several thousand people faced off with a force of officers on the streets around a Brooklyn sports arena. The NYPD said at least 120 people were arrested and at least 15 police vehicles destroyed New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, a Democrat, blamed the destruction on a small number of agitators who he said 'do not represent this city' and were purposely trying to incite violence against police. 'We appreciate and respect all peaceful protest, but now it is time for people to go home,' de Blasio told reporters outside the city's emergency management headquarters just after 11:30 p.m. 'What we're seeing is people coming in from outside, a lot of them are purporting to speak about the issues of communities of color, but a lot of them are not from communities of color,' de Blasio said on the local cable news station NY1. Elsewhere in the state, the mayor in Rochester declared a state of emergency and a 9 p.m. curfew after demonstrators destroyed police cars, setting one on fire, and officers responded with tear gas canisters. In Buffalo, numerous storefronts had their windows smashed. Albany police used tear gas and rode horses in efforts to quell demonstrators throwing objects. The protests in each city were all held in defiance of a statewide ban on gatherings imposed to stop the spread of the coronavirus. 'This is bigger than the pandemic,' said Brooklyn protester Meryl Makielski, referring to the outbreak that, until recently, was killing hundreds of New Yorkers each day. 'The mistakes that are happening are not mistakes. They're repeated violent terrorist offenses and people need to stop killing black people. Cops seem as though they've been trained to do so.' Earlier in the day, de Blasio had expressed solidarity with demonstrators upset about police brutality, but promised an independent review of demonstrations Friday night in which a mob set fire to a police van and battered police cruisers with clubs and officers beat people with batons. Gov. Andrew Cuomo said he had asked the state's attorney general, Letitia James, to lead an inquiry and make a public report. The mayor said he was upset by videos of confrontations 'where protesters were handled very violently' by police, including one that showed a woman being needlessly thrown to the ground. But he defended officers in the streets, saying they were being subjected 'to horrible, vile things.' Of the video of officers driving into a crowd Saturday, de Blasio said it would be investigated, but that the officers acted because they were being attacked. Violance early Saturday resulted in federal charges against three people suspected of building and throwing Molotov cocktails at police vehicles in two separate incidents in Brooklyn. The U.S. attorney's office in Brooklyn said Samantha Shader, 27, of Catskill, New York, admitted under questioning to throwing her device at a van occupied by four officers. It did not ignite and the officers were unharmed, police said. Shader's sister, Dorian, was also arrested and will face charges in state court, the Brooklyn district attorney's office said. Colinford Mattis, 32, and Urooj Rahman, 31, both of Brooklyn, are accused of targeting a police van. They were charged under a federal statute regarding the use of fire and explosives to cause damage to a police vehicle and each face 5 to 20 years in prison if convicted. Information on their lawyers was not immediately available. Police Commissioner Dermot Shea said more than 200 people were arrested and multiple officers were injured in Friday night's protests, including one who lost a tooth. Asked to comment on videos that showed officers shoving peaceful protesters to the ground and hitting people with batons, Shea said those acts would be investigated. But, he said, 'It is very hard to practice de-escalation when there is a brick being thrown at your head.' 'It is by the grace of God that we don't have dead officers today,' he said. In a peaceful gathering Saturday afternoon, the Rev. Al Sharpton addressed several hundred people in Staten Island at the spot where Eric Garner died after being placed in a chokehold by a police officer in 2014. He was accompanied by Garner's mother, Gwen Carr. Sharpton noted that Floyd, who died Monday in Minneapolis after an officer pressed his knee into his neck, had also fallen unconscious gasping for air. 'Right at this spot is where we heard Eric Garner say what six years later was said by George: 'I can't breathe.'' Cuomo noted that Floyd's death was just the latest in a long list of similar deaths, and he said he shared in the outrage over 'this fundamental injustice.' 'But violence is not the answer. It never is the answer,"" he said. 'The violence obscures the righteousness of the message and the mission.' ___ Associated Press writers Jennifer Peltz, Michael R.

Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Chief Randal Taylor confirmed the shootings during a late night news conference, but didn't offer any more details. Police later tweeted that no officers were involved. Protests became dangerous for a second straight night in Indianapolis as buildings were damaged, officers deployed tear gas and at least one business was briefly on fire. ___ Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden condemned the violence in a statement, as he continued to express common cause with those demonstrating after Floyd's death. 'The act of protesting should never be allowed to overshadow the reason we protest,' Biden said in a statement Saturday night. 'It should not drive people away from the just cause that protest is meant to advance.' ___ MINNEAPOLIS "" Officials in Minneapolis say they've succeeded for now in stopping the violent protests that ravaged parts of the city for several days after the death of George Floyd. Police, state troopers and National Guard members moved in to break up protests after an 8 p.m. curfew took effect, firing tear gas and rubber bullets to clear streets outside a police precinct and elsewhere. The show of force came after three days where police mostly declined to engage with protesters. It also came after the state poured in more than 4,000 National Guard members and said the number would soon rise to nearly 11,000. As Minneapolis streets appeared largely quiet, Corrections Commissioner Paul Schnell said the heavy response would remain as long as it takes to 'quell this situation.' Floyd, a handcuffed black man, died after a Minneapolis police officer kneeled on his neck for several minutes. ___ RICHMOND, Va. "" The Richmond, Virginia, police headquarters was the target of protesters for the second night in a row as officers formed a barricade around the building late Saturday night. A dumpster was set afire near the police headquarters, which had its front windows broken out Friday night. The Richmond Times-Dispatch reported that the police fired tear gas to move crowds away from the building. Several blocks away near Virginia Commonwealth University hundreds of protesters blocked streets chanting 'George Floyd,' referring to the black man who died Monday after an arresting officer in Minneapolis pushed his knee into Floyd's neck while he was on the ground handcuffed. Media reports showed video of protesters hurling what appeared to be water bottles at a police car, which moved through the crowd and sped away. A police cruiser was burned in the violence on Friday night, along with a city bus. ___ LOS ANGELES -- The mayor of Los Angeles says the National Guard will be deployed overnight to help local law enforcement quell violence in the nation's second-largest city. Mayor Eric Garcetti says he asked California Gov. Gavin Newsom on Saturday to send 500 to 700 members of the Guard. Crowds of demonstrators have torched police cars, vandalized and burglarized stores and clashed with lines of officers. Hundreds of people have been arrested since Friday night. ___ SALT LAKE CITY "" Protests are continuing in Salt Lake City despite a curfew issued by the mayor and National Guard troops deployed by Utah's governor. Police officials say they are prepared to give people time to leave, but they plan to arrest people who refused to comply. What started as a peaceful demonstration Saturday against the death of George Floyd turned destructive. A group of people flipped over a police car and lit it on fire. A second car was later set on fire. Police officials say six people have been arrested and that a police officer was injured after being struck in the head with a baseball bat. ___ RENO, Nevada -- City officials in Reno instituted an immediate mandatory curfew Saturday night after protesters broke windows at City Hall and set fires. Police fired tear gas into the building, the Rene Gazette Journal reported, and a SWAT team arrived to help disperse the crowd. The fires were extinguished. In announcing the curfew in a statement, city officials asked residents to avoid the downtown area, where a 'heavy police presence' would be in force overnight. ___ RALEIGH, N.C. "" More than 1,000 people marched in downtown Raleigh on Saturday night, breaking windows as police in riot gear released tear gas and pepper spray to disburse the crowds. WRAL-TV showed video of throngs of people in front of the Wake County Courthouse, some walking with signs, others on bikes and skateboards to protest the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis by a police officer on Monday. Protesters gathered in late afternoon marching peacefully north from the courthouse chanting 'No Justice, No Peace.' But tension grew after nightfall as some people threw rocks at windows and spray painted anti-police slogans on walls. Fayetteville Street was the focus of most of the vandalism with multiple buildings along the street having windows broken out. ___ MIAMI "" A student at Florida International University said the protest was largely peaceful with the crowd of about 500 'singing, we were doing poetry' and urging each other not to 'break windows' or hurt businesses. But when they arrived at the police station, another group of protesters also converged there and things escalated within minutes. 'There was a sniper on the roof with the police chief standing next to him and they started throwing smoke bombs to the crowd,"" 27-year-old Liseth Hatta said. 'Most of them were kids. They couldn't' have been older than 21. Everyone ran away screaming;' They tried to flee and rushed to the train station to head home, but police closed down the entrance. 'A lot of people tried to get back on the train to leave and they weren't letting us,' Hatta said. 'They basically trapped us in.' ___ ATLANTA "" An Atlanta police officer was struck by someone riding an ATV in downtown Atlanta during protests that continued despite a curfew, and police said they were still trying to determine whether the crash was deliberate. Police spokesman Carlos Campos said it happened about 10:30 p.m.; the mayor had set a 9 p.m. curfew. The officer suffered significant injuries and was in stable condition, Campos said. The ATV drive suffered minor injuries and was taken into custody, Campos said. ___ LOS ANGELES "" Police have arrested nearly 1,400 people in 17 U.S. cities as protests continue over the death of George Floyd. Floyd died Monday in Minnesota after a police officer put his knee on Floyd's neck for more than eight minutes. The officer was arrested Friday and charged with third-degree murder. But the arrest has done little to quell protests across the country. Most have been peaceful. But a few have erupted in violence. An Associated Press tally of arrests found at least 1,383 people have been arrested since Thursday. The actual number is likely higher as protests continue Saturday night. ___ WASHINGTON "" The National Guard has been called out in Washington, D.C., as pockets of violence erupted during a second straight night of protests over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis and President Donald Trump's reaction to it. Hundreds of protesters converged on the White House during the day Saturday and marched on the National Mall, chanting 'Black Lives Matter,' 'I can't breathe' and 'No justice, no peace.' Police used pepper spray to try to disperse the crowd but the standoff continued. Protesters dragged away barricades and some broke up concrete to use as projectiles. At one point, a trash bin was set on fire. National Guard troops took up position around the White House on Saturday night.___ WASHINGTON "" President Donald Trump appears to be cheering on the tougher tactics being used by law enforcement around the country to confront sometimes violent demonstrators joining in protests over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. On Saturday, the president commended National Guard troops deployed in Minneapolis, declaring 'No games!' He also said police in New York City 'must be allowed to do their job!' In a tweet, Trump said: 'Let New York's Finest be New York's Finest.' He was commenting on Twitter from the White House while crowds of protesters gathered outside. ___ NASHVILLE, Tennessee "" The mayor of Nashville, Tennessee, has declared a state of civil emergency after protesters set a fire inside the Metro Courthouse in the state's capital city. Thousands had rallied near the Capitol building Saturday afternoon to peacefully protest police brutality and racism. But things turned violent after darkness fell, with protesters breaking windows in government buildings and causing other property damage. The Tennessean newspaper says demonstrators also pulled down a statue outside the Capitol of Edward Carmack, a controversial former lawmaker and newspaper publisher who espoused racist views.

Bill Lee issued an order Saturday night for the National Guard to mobilize 'in response to protests that have now taken a violent, unlawful turn in Nashville.' ___ MINNEAPOLIS "" Police in Minneapolis are confronting protesters out after curfew on the fifth day of protests over the death of George Floyd. A group of marchers was moving north toward downtown on a city street when officers fired tear gas Saturday night. The group immediately retreated. Soon after, officers fired tear gas and moved in to push away throngs of protesters who were milling around the city police's 5th Precinct. The tougher tactics came after city and state leaders were criticized for not more strongly confronting violent and damaging protests. Minneapolis has been the epicenter of protests since the death Monday of Floyd after a police officer pressed his knee on Floyd's neck for some eight minutes. The protests have spread to cities across the United States. ___ CHICAGO "" Chicago's mayor has announced an overnight curfew in the city running from 9 p.m. Saturday until 6 a.m. Sunday, and she says police will crack down on any violence.

Thousands ignored the Friday night curfew and peaceful protests gave way to violence late into the night. ___ PHILADELPHIA "" Authorities in Philadelphia say a peaceful demonstration protesting the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis later turned violence, and at least 13 police officers have been injured amid incidents of arson and store break-ins in the city's doqwntown. Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw says at least four police vehicles were set ablaze and other fires were set throughout downtown Saturday afternoon. Protesters smashed windows and stole merchandise from stores as police tried to worked to corral the crowd, which Outlaw estimates numbered about 3,000. Protesters also sprayed graffiti on a statue of former Philadelphia Mayor Frank Rizzo, tried to topple it and set a fire at its base. Rizzo was Philadelphia's mayor from 1972 to 1980 and was praised by supporters as tough on crime but accused by critics of discriminating against minorities. Authorities in Philadelphia have ordered a citywide curfew has been implemented from 8 p.m. Saturday to 7 a.m. Sunday. ___ SALT LAKE CITY "" Utah Gov. Gary Herbert has activated the Utah National Guard after protesters angry over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis turned violent during a demonstration at which some participants carried rifles in Salt Lake City. Herbert says in a tweet that the Guard will help control 'the escalating situation' in the downtown area following the unrest Saturday afternoon. The protest started out peacefully, but degenerated into violence. A group of people flipped over a police car and lit it on fire.

Some people in the protest openly carried rifles, which is legal in Utah. ___ LOS ANGELES -- Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti has imposed a downtown curfew for Saturday night after some protests over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis turned violent. With protesters were back out Saturday, Garcetti said everyone must be off down town streets by 8 p.m. and stay away until 5:30 a.m. Several police cars were torched Saturday afternoon as some protesters ignored authorities' call for peaceful demonstrations. That followed a night of violence during which people smashed windows, robbed stores and set fires. Los Angeles police reported arresting 533 people during the night. ___ SEATTLE "" The Washington State Patrol has closed Interstate 5 in both directions through downtown Seattle after a protest over the death of George Floyd spilled onto the freeway. Thousands of people gathered in the downtown area Saturday for a largely peaceful demonstration, but some protesters turned rowdier as the afternoon worn on.

State patrol Chief John Batiste said in a statement that 'the freeway is not a safe or appropriate place for demonstration.' ___ ATLANTA "" A crowd has gathered in Atlanta to protest the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis and some people have started throwing objects at officers guarding the Georgia governor's mansion. Hundreds of people stood on a residential sidewalk Saturday evening across the street from the mansion in the city's affluent Buckhead neighborhood. Cars and motorcyclists continued to sporadically drive by in front of the demonstrators. Authorities responded by taking at least one person into custody. Gov. Brian Kemp was not inside the home Saturday evening. Earlier in the day, Atlanta's mayor announced a curfew will be in effect in the city from 9 p.m. Saturday to sunrise Sunday. That order followed a night of violence that erupted in the city during demonstrations over Floyd's death. ___ MINNEAPOLIS "" Several Minneapolis City Council members are asking Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz to appoint the state's attorney general as a special prosecutor in the death of George Floyd. Six of the council's 13 members say they support a call from Floyd's family for Attorney General Keith Ellison to handle the prosecution of the police officer who held his knee on Floyd's neck Monday. The council members say they don't think Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman has the public trust necessary for the job. Freeman on Friday charged now-fired officer Derek Chauvin with third-degree murder in Floyd's death. Chauvin is white; Floyd was black. The council members say Freeman waited too long in bringing charge. They say Ellison, who is black, is best qualified to handle the case. They also cite a working group he helped lead on deaths involving police. ___ WASHINGTON "" Several hundred people shouting 'Black Lives Matter' and 'I can't breathe' have converged on the White House for a second straight day to protest the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis and President Donald Trump's response. Trump earlier on Saturday belittled the protesters and he pledged to 'stop mob violence.' Speaking in Florida after watching the launch of a SpaceX rocket, the president said: 'I stand before you as a friend and ally to every American seeking justice and peace, and I stand before you in firm opposition to anyone exploiting this tragedy to loot, rob, attack and menace. Healing, not hatred, justice, not chaos are the missions at hand.' Three lines of barricades separate protesters from a loose line of uniformed police officers at Lafayette Park, across from the White House. At one point, the protesters left the park, chanting as they marched up a nearby street. A block from the White House, they held a moment of silence and brief sit-in. ___ ATLANTA -- Atlanta's mayor has announced a curfew will be in effect from 9 p.m. Saturday to sunrise Sunday following violence that erupted in the city during demonstrations over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms announced the curfew during a news conference Saturday evening. She called it a 'very unusual and extreme step' after the violence that rocked Atlanta during Friday night. Several other cities across the nation have order curfews following unrest surrounding demonstrations protesting Floyd's death. Georgia's governor declared a state of emergency early Saturday to activate the state National Guard as violence flared in Atlanta. In Friday's protests, some demonstrators smashed police cars and spray-painted the iconic logo sign at CNN headquarters downtown. Police say at least three officers were hurt and there were multiple arrests as protesters shot at officers with BB guns and threw bricks, bottles and knives. Atlanta officials said crews were temporarily unable to reach a fire at a restaurant because of crowds of protesters. ___ NEW YORK "" Protesters angry over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis have returned to the streets of New York for a third straight day as Mayor Bill de Blasio pleads for calm after a demonstration in Brooklyn the previous night descended into chaos that left people bloodied and vehicles burned. On Saturday, a large crowd marched through Harlem, chanted outside a police precinct and then blocked traffic on the highway along Manhattan's East River. Demonstrations of several thousand at Union Square and outside Brooklyn's Prospect Park appeared mostly peaceful. Late in the day, protesters in Brooklyn confronted police, who shoved some of the demonstrators and used an irritating chemical spray. De Blasio expressed solidarity with demonstrators upset over police brutality, but promised an independent review of the Friday night confrontation in which both protesters and police officers engaged in violence. The mayor said he was upset by videos of the clashes in which 'protesters were handled very violently' by police and by reports that a state senator and member of the state Assembly were among the people sprayed with irritating chemicals by officers. ___ CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla "" President Donald Trump says he will not tolerate mob violence during demonstrations over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis.

'It should not drive people away from the just cause that protest is meant to advance.' ___ MINNEAPOLIS "" Officials in Minneapolis say they've succeeded for now in stopping the violent protests that ravaged parts of the city for several days after the death of George Floyd. Police, state troopers and National Guard members moved in to break up protests after an 8 p.m. curfew took effect, firing tear gas and rubber bullets to clear streets outside a police precinct and elsewhere. The show of force came after three days where police mostly declined to engage with protesters. It also came after the state poured in more than 4,000 National Guard members and said the number would soon rise to nearly 11,000. As Minneapolis streets appeared largely quiet, Corrections Commissioner Paul Schnell said the heavy response would remain as long as it takes to 'quell this situation.' Floyd, a handcuffed black man, died after a Minneapolis police officer kneeled on his neck for several minutes. ___ RICHMOND, Va. "" The Richmond, Virginia, police headquarters was the target of protesters for the second night in a row as officers formed a barricade around the building late Saturday night. A dumpster was set afire near the police headquarters, which had its front windows broken out Friday night. The Richmond Times-Dispatch reported that the police fired tear gas to move crowds away from the building. Several blocks away near Virginia Commonwealth University hundreds of protesters blocked streets chanting 'George Floyd,' referring to the black man who died Monday after an arresting officer in Minneapolis pushed his knee into Floyd's neck while he was on the ground handcuffed.

A police cruiser was burned in the violence on Friday night, along with a city bus. ___ LOS ANGELES -- The mayor of Los Angeles says the National Guard will be deployed overnight to help local law enforcement quell violence in the nation's second-largest city. Mayor Eric Garcetti says he asked California Gov. Gavin Newsom on Saturday to send 500 to 700 members of the Guard. Crowds of demonstrators have torched police cars, vandalized and burglarized stores and clashed with lines of officers. Hundreds of people have been arrested since Friday night. ___ SALT LAKE CITY "" Protests are continuing in Salt Lake City despite a curfew issued by the mayor and National Guard troops deployed by Utah's governor. Police officials say they are prepared to give people time to leave, but they plan to arrest people who refused to comply.

In announcing the curfew in a statement, city officials asked residents to avoid the downtown area, where a 'heavy police presence' would be in force overnight. ___ RALEIGH, N.C. "" More than 1,000 people marched in downtown Raleigh on Saturday night, breaking windows as police in riot gear released tear gas and pepper spray to disburse the crowds. WRAL-TV showed video of throngs of people in front of the Wake County Courthouse, some walking with signs, others on bikes and skateboards to protest the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis by a police officer on Monday. Protesters gathered in late afternoon marching peacefully north from the courthouse chanting 'No Justice, No Peace.' But tension grew after nightfall as some people threw rocks at windows and spray painted anti-police slogans on walls. Fayetteville Street was the focus of most of the vandalism with multiple buildings along the street having windows broken out. ___ MIAMI "" A student at Florida International University said the protest was largely peaceful with the crowd of about 500 'singing, we were doing poetry' and urging each other not to 'break windows' or hurt businesses. But when they arrived at the police station, another group of protesters also converged there and things escalated within minutes. 'There was a sniper on the roof with the police chief standing next to him and they started throwing smoke bombs to the crowd,"" 27-year-old Liseth Hatta said. 'Most of them were kids. They couldn't' have been older than 21. Everyone ran away screaming;' They tried to flee and rushed to the train station to head home, but police closed down the entrance. 'A lot of people tried to get back on the train to leave and they weren't letting us,' Hatta said. 'They basically trapped us in.' ___ ATLANTA "" An Atlanta police officer was struck by someone riding an ATV in downtown Atlanta during protests that continued despite a curfew, and police said they were still trying to determine whether the crash was deliberate.

The actual number is likely higher as protests continue Saturday night. ___ WASHINGTON "" The National Guard has been called out in Washington, D.C., as pockets of violence erupted during a second straight night of protests over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis and President Donald Trump's reaction to it.

'There was a sniper on the roof with the police chief standing next to him and they started throwing smoke bombs to the crowd,"" 27-year-old Liseth Hatta said. 'Most of them were kids. They couldn't' have been older than 21. Everyone ran away screaming;' They tried to flee and rushed to the train station to head home, but police closed down the entrance. 'A lot of people tried to get back on the train to leave and they weren't letting us,' Hatta said. 'They basically trapped us in.' ___ ATLANTA "" An Atlanta police officer was struck by someone riding an ATV in downtown Atlanta during protests that continued despite a curfew, and police said they were still trying to determine whether the crash was deliberate. Police spokesman Carlos Campos said it happened about 10:30 p.m.; the mayor had set a 9 p.m. curfew. The officer suffered significant injuries and was in stable condition, Campos said. The ATV drive suffered minor injuries and was taken into custody, Campos said. ___ LOS ANGELES "" Police have arrested nearly 1,400 people in 17 U.S. cities as protests continue over the death of George Floyd. Floyd died Monday in Minnesota after a police officer put his knee on Floyd's neck for more than eight minutes. The officer was arrested Friday and charged with third-degree murder. But the arrest has done little to quell protests across the country. Most have been peaceful. But a few have erupted in violence. An Associated Press tally of arrests found at least 1,383 people have been arrested since Thursday. The actual number is likely higher as protests continue Saturday night. ___ WASHINGTON "" The National Guard has been called out in Washington, D.C., as pockets of violence erupted during a second straight night of protests over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis and President Donald Trump's reaction to it. Hundreds of protesters converged on the White House during the day Saturday and marched on the National Mall, chanting 'Black Lives Matter,' 'I can't breathe' and 'No justice, no peace.' Police used pepper spray to try to disperse the crowd but the standoff continued. Protesters dragged away barricades and some broke up concrete to use as projectiles. At one point, a trash bin was set on fire. National Guard troops took up position around the White House on Saturday night.___ WASHINGTON "" President Donald Trump appears to be cheering on the tougher tactics being used by law enforcement around the country to confront sometimes violent demonstrators joining in protests over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. On Saturday, the president commended National Guard troops deployed in Minneapolis, declaring 'No games!' He also said police in New York City 'must be allowed to do their job!' In a tweet, Trump said: 'Let New York's Finest be New York's Finest.' He was commenting on Twitter from the White House while crowds of protesters gathered outside. ___ NASHVILLE, Tennessee "" The mayor of Nashville, Tennessee, has declared a state of civil emergency after protesters set a fire inside the Metro Courthouse in the state's capital city. Thousands had rallied near the Capitol building Saturday afternoon to peacefully protest police brutality and racism. But things turned violent after darkness fell, with protesters breaking windows in government buildings and causing other property damage. The Tennessean newspaper says demonstrators also pulled down a statue outside the Capitol of Edward Carmack, a controversial former lawmaker and newspaper publisher who espoused racist views. Police deployed tear gas and began warning demonstrators that the protest was unlawful. Gov. Bill Lee issued an order Saturday night for the National Guard to mobilize 'in response to protests that have now taken a violent, unlawful turn in Nashville.' ___ MINNEAPOLIS "" Police in Minneapolis are confronting protesters out after curfew on the fifth day of protests over the death of George Floyd. A group of marchers was moving north toward downtown on a city street when officers fired tear gas Saturday night. The group immediately retreated. Soon after, officers fired tear gas and moved in to push away throngs of protesters who were milling around the city police's 5th Precinct. The tougher tactics came after city and state leaders were criticized for not more strongly confronting violent and damaging protests. Minneapolis has been the epicenter of protests since the death Monday of Floyd after a police officer pressed his knee on Floyd's neck for some eight minutes. The protests have spread to cities across the United States. ___ CHICAGO "" Chicago's mayor has announced an overnight curfew in the city running from 9 p.m. Saturday until 6 a.m. Sunday, and she says police will crack down on any violence. Mayor Lori Lightfoot says that peaceful protesting over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis has 'devolved into criminal conduct.' She says police will be aggressive with arrests for anyone caught damaging property. In the mayor's words: 'We can have zero tolerance for people who came prepared for a fight and tried to initiate and provoke our police department.' ___ MIAMI "" An initially peaceful protest in Miami over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis has turned violent, with some demonstrators setting fire to police cars. Witnesses to the clash Saturday say officers responded with tear gas and fireworks to disperse the crowd. The mayor has declared a 10 p.m. curfew. At one point, Interstate 95 was shut down as protesters stood on the busy highway. Police also used bicycles to push back an increasingly rowdy crowd throwing rocks. Elsewhere in Florida, protesters in Tampa smashed store windows and set a gas station ablaze Saturday night after a peaceful demonstration during the day. Some broke into AT&T and Gold N Diamond stores. ___ Curfews are in effect or imminent in more than a dozen U.S. cities facing rising unrest following the death of George Floyd. The start times Saturday evening range from 6 p.m. in parts of South Carolina to 10 p.m. around Ohio. People are being told to get off the streets beginning at 8 p.m. or 9 p.m. in Atlanta, Denver, Los Angeles and Seattle. A curfew is in effect for a second night in and around Minneapolis, where Floyd died earlier this week after a police officer pressed his knee on Floyd's neck for more than eight minutes during an arrest. Thousands ignored the Friday night curfew and peaceful protests gave way to violence late into the night. ___ PHILADELPHIA "" Authorities in Philadelphia say a peaceful demonstration protesting the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis later turned violence, and at least 13 police officers have been injured amid incidents of arson and store break-ins in the city's doqwntown. Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw says at least four police vehicles were set ablaze and other fires were set throughout downtown Saturday afternoon. Protesters smashed windows and stole merchandise from stores as police tried to worked to corral the crowd, which Outlaw estimates numbered about 3,000. Protesters also sprayed graffiti on a statue of former Philadelphia Mayor Frank Rizzo, tried to topple it and set a fire at its base. Rizzo was Philadelphia's mayor from 1972 to 1980 and was praised by supporters as tough on crime but accused by critics of discriminating against minorities. Authorities in Philadelphia have ordered a citywide curfew has been implemented from 8 p.m. Saturday to 7 a.m. Sunday. ___ SALT LAKE CITY "" Utah Gov. Gary Herbert has activated the Utah National Guard after protesters angry over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis turned violent during a demonstration at which some participants carried rifles in Salt Lake City. Herbert says in a tweet that the Guard will help control 'the escalating situation' in the downtown area following the unrest Saturday afternoon. The protest started out peacefully, but degenerated into violence. A group of people flipped over a police car and lit it on fire. Some demonstrators smashed eggs and wrote graffiti on the walls of the Salt Lake City police station. Others marched through downtown to the state Capitol. Some people in the protest openly carried rifles, which is legal in Utah. ___ LOS ANGELES -- Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti has imposed a downtown curfew for Saturday night after some protests over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis turned violent. With protesters were back out Saturday, Garcetti said everyone must be off down town streets by 8 p.m. and stay away until 5:30 a.m. Several police cars were torched Saturday afternoon as some protesters ignored authorities' call for peaceful demonstrations. That followed a night of violence during which people smashed windows, robbed stores and set fires. Los Angeles police reported arresting 533 people during the night. ___ SEATTLE "" The Washington State Patrol has closed Interstate 5 in both directions through downtown Seattle after a protest over the death of George Floyd spilled onto the freeway. Thousands of people gathered in the downtown area Saturday for a largely peaceful demonstration, but some protesters turned rowdier as the afternoon worn on. Police used pepper spray on the demonstrators and deployed flash bang devices. Police said arrests were made but an exact figure wasn't available. State patrol Chief John Batiste said in a statement that 'the freeway is not a safe or appropriate place for demonstration.' ___ ATLANTA "" A crowd has gathered in Atlanta to protest the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis and some people have started throwing objects at officers guarding the Georgia governor's mansion. Hundreds of people stood on a residential sidewalk Saturday evening across the street from the mansion in the city's affluent Buckhead neighborhood. Cars and motorcyclists continued to sporadically drive by in front of the demonstrators. Authorities responded by taking at least one person into custody. Gov. Brian Kemp was not inside the home Saturday evening. Earlier in the day, Atlanta's mayor announced a curfew will be in effect in the city from 9 p.m. Saturday to sunrise Sunday. That order followed a night of violence that erupted in the city during demonstrations over Floyd's death. ___ MINNEAPOLIS "" Several Minneapolis City Council members are asking Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz to appoint the state's attorney general as a special prosecutor in the death of George Floyd. Six of the council's 13 members say they support a call from Floyd's family for Attorney General Keith Ellison to handle the prosecution of the police officer who held his knee on Floyd's neck Monday. The council members say they don't think Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman has the public trust necessary for the job. Freeman on Friday charged now-fired officer Derek Chauvin with third-degree murder in Floyd's death. Chauvin is white; Floyd was black. The council members say Freeman waited too long in bringing charge. They say Ellison, who is black, is best qualified to handle the case. They also cite a working group he helped lead on deaths involving police. ___ WASHINGTON "" Several hundred people shouting 'Black Lives Matter' and 'I can't breathe' have converged on the White House for a second straight day to protest the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis and President Donald Trump's response. Trump earlier on Saturday belittled the protesters and he pledged to 'stop mob violence.' Speaking in Florida after watching the launch of a SpaceX rocket, the president said: 'I stand before you as a friend and ally to every American seeking justice and peace, and I stand before you in firm opposition to anyone exploiting this tragedy to loot, rob, attack and menace. Healing, not hatred, justice, not chaos are the missions at hand.' Three lines of barricades separate protesters from a loose line of uniformed police officers at Lafayette Park, across from the White House. At one point, the protesters left the park, chanting as they marched up a nearby street. A block from the White House, they held a moment of silence and brief sit-in. ___ ATLANTA -- Atlanta's mayor has announced a curfew will be in effect from 9 p.m. Saturday to sunrise Sunday following violence that erupted in the city during demonstrations over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms announced the curfew during a news conference Saturday evening. She called it a 'very unusual and extreme step' after the violence that rocked Atlanta during Friday night. Several other cities across the nation have order curfews following unrest surrounding demonstrations protesting Floyd's death. Georgia's governor declared a state of emergency early Saturday to activate the state National Guard as violence flared in Atlanta. In Friday's protests, some demonstrators smashed police cars and spray-painted the iconic logo sign at CNN headquarters downtown. Police say at least three officers were hurt and there were multiple arrests as protesters shot at officers with BB guns and threw bricks, bottles and knives. Atlanta officials said crews were temporarily unable to reach a fire at a restaurant because of crowds of protesters. ___ NEW YORK "" Protesters angry over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis have returned to the streets of New York for a third straight day as Mayor Bill de Blasio pleads for calm after a demonstration in Brooklyn the previous night descended into chaos that left people bloodied and vehicles burned. On Saturday, a large crowd marched through Harlem, chanted outside a police precinct and then blocked traffic on the highway along Manhattan's East River. Demonstrations of several thousand at Union Square and outside Brooklyn's Prospect Park appeared mostly peaceful. Late in the day, protesters in Brooklyn confronted police, who shoved some of the demonstrators and used an irritating chemical spray. De Blasio expressed solidarity with demonstrators upset over police brutality, but promised an independent review of the Friday night confrontation in which both protesters and police officers engaged in violence. The mayor said he was upset by videos of the clashes in which 'protesters were handled very violently' by police and by reports that a state senator and member of the state Assembly were among the people sprayed with irritating chemicals by officers. ___ CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla "" President Donald Trump says he will not tolerate mob violence during demonstrations over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis.

Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Chief Randal Taylor confirmed the shootings during a late night news conference, but didn't offer any more details. Police later tweeted that no officers were involved. Protests became dangerous for a second straight night in Indianapolis as buildings were damaged, officers deployed tear gas and at least one business was briefly on fire. ___ Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden condemned the violence in a statement, as he continued to express common cause with those demonstrating after Floyd's death. 'The act of protesting should never be allowed to overshadow the reason we protest,' Biden said in a statement Saturday night. 'It should not drive people away from the just cause that protest is meant to advance.' ___ MINNEAPOLIS "" Officials in Minneapolis say they've succeeded for now in stopping the violent protests that ravaged parts of the city for several days after the death of George Floyd. Police, state troopers and National Guard members moved in to break up protests after an 8 p.m. curfew took effect, firing tear gas and rubber bullets to clear streets outside a police precinct and elsewhere. The show of force came after three days where police mostly declined to engage with protesters. It also came after the state poured in more than 4,000 National Guard members and said the number would soon rise to nearly 11,000. As Minneapolis streets appeared largely quiet, Corrections Commissioner Paul Schnell said the heavy response would remain as long as it takes to 'quell this situation.' Floyd, a handcuffed black man, died after a Minneapolis police officer kneeled on his neck for several minutes. ___ RICHMOND, Va. "" The Richmond, Virginia, police headquarters was the target of protesters for the second night in a row as officers formed a barricade around the building late Saturday night. A dumpster was set afire near the police headquarters, which had its front windows broken out Friday night. The Richmond Times-Dispatch reported that the police fired tear gas to move crowds away from the building. Several blocks away near Virginia Commonwealth University hundreds of protesters blocked streets chanting 'George Floyd,' referring to the black man who died Monday after an arresting officer in Minneapolis pushed his knee into Floyd's neck while he was on the ground handcuffed.

A police cruiser was burned in the violence on Friday night, along with a city bus. ___ LOS ANGELES -- The mayor of Los Angeles says the National Guard will be deployed overnight to help local law enforcement quell violence in the nation's second-largest city.

Hundreds of people have been arrested since Friday night. ___ SALT LAKE CITY "" Protests are continuing in Salt Lake City despite a curfew issued by the mayor and National Guard troops deployed by Utah's governor. Police officials say they are prepared to give people time to leave, but they plan to arrest people who refused to comply.

A second car was later set on fire. Police officials say six people have been arrested and that a police officer was injured after being struck in the head with a baseball bat. ___ RENO, Nevada -- City officials in Reno instituted an immediate mandatory curfew Saturday night after protesters broke windows at City Hall and set fires. Police fired tear gas into the building, the Rene Gazette Journal reported, and a SWAT team arrived to help disperse the crowd. The fires were extinguished. In announcing the curfew in a statement, city officials asked residents to avoid the downtown area, where a 'heavy police presence' would be in force overnight. ___ RALEIGH, N.C. "" More than 1,000 people marched in downtown Raleigh on Saturday night, breaking windows as police in riot gear released tear gas and pepper spray to disburse the crowds. WRAL-TV showed video of throngs of people in front of the Wake County Courthouse, some walking with signs, others on bikes and skateboards to protest the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis by a police officer on Monday. Protesters gathered in late afternoon marching peacefully north from the courthouse chanting 'No Justice, No Peace.' But tension grew after nightfall as some people threw rocks at windows and spray painted anti-police slogans on walls. Fayetteville Street was the focus of most of the vandalism with multiple buildings along the street having windows broken out. ___ MIAMI "" A student at Florida International University said the protest was largely peaceful with the crowd of about 500 'singing, we were doing poetry' and urging each other not to 'break windows' or hurt businesses.

The protests, which began in Minneapolis following Floyd's death Monday after a police officer pressed a knee on his neck until he stopped breathing, have left parts of the city a grid of broken windows, burned-out buildings and ransacked stores. The unrest has since become a national phenomenon as protesters decry years of deaths at police hands. Tens of thousands of people were in the streets across the country, many of them not wearing masks or observing social distancing, raising concerns among health experts about the potential for spreading the coronavirus pandemic at a time when much of the country is in the process of reopening society and the economy. After a tumultuous Friday, racially diverse crowds held mostly peaceful demonstrations in dozens of cities, though many later descended into violence as had happened the previous night. Few corners of America were untouched, from protesters setting fires inside Reno's city hall, to police launching tear gas at rock-throwing demonstrators in Fargo, North Dakota, to shattered windows at police headquarters in Richmond, Virginia. "" In Indianapolis, police were investigating 'multiple shootings' downtown, including one that left a person dead, amid the protests. Police gave few details but said no officers were involved. "" In Washington, the National Guard was deployed outside the White House, where chanting crowds taunted law enforcement officers. Dressed in camouflage and holding shields, the troops stood in a tight line a few yards from the crowd, preventing them from pushing forward. President Donald Trump, who spent much of Saturday in Florida for the SpaceX rocket launch, landed on the lawn in the presidential helicopter at dusk and went inside without speaking to journalists. "" In Philadelphia, at least 13 officers were injured when peaceful protests turned violent and at least four police vehicles were set on fire. Other fires were set throughout downtown. "" In Salt Lake City, protesters defied a curfew and National Guard troops were deployed by Utah's governor. Demonstrators flipped a police car and lit it on fire, and another vehicle was later set ablaze. Police said six people were arrested and a police officer was injured after being struck in the head with a baseball bat. "" In Los Angeles, protesters chanted 'Black Lives Matter,' some within inches of the face shields of officers. Police used batons to move the crowd back and fired rubber bullets. A graffiti-covered police car burned in the street. "" And in New York City, dangerous confrontations flared repeatedly as officers made arrests and cleared streets. A video showed two NYPD cruisers lurching into a crowd of demonstrators who were pushing a barricade against one of them and pelting it with objects. Several people were knocked to the ground, and it was unclear if anyone was hurt. 'The mistakes that are happening are not mistakes. They're repeated violent terrorist offenses and people need to stop killing black people,"" Brooklyn protester Meryl Makielski said. Not all protests devolved into violence. In Juneau, Alaska, law enforcement officers joined elected officials and residents at a peaceful protest in front of a giant whale sculpture on the city's waterfront. 'We don't tolerate excessive use of force,' Juneau Police Chief Ed Mercer told the gathering. Back in Minneapolis, the city where the protests began, police, state troopers and National Guard members moved in soon after an 8 p.m. curfew took effect to break up protests, firing tear gas and rubber bullets to clear streets outside a police precinct and elsewhere. The show of force came after three days when police largely avoided engaging protesters, and after the state poured in more than 4,000 National Guard troops to Minneapolis and said the number would soon rise to nearly 11,000. 'The situation in Minneapolis is no longer in any way about the murder of George Floyd,' said Gov. Tim Walz, who also said local forces had been overmatched the previous day. 'It is about attacking civil society, instilling fear and disrupting our great cities.' Minneapolis' streets steadily grew calmer as the night went on, and Corrections Commissioner Paul Schnell said the tough response would remain as long as it takes to 'quell this situation.' Some residents were glad to see the upheaval dissipating. 'l live here. I haven't been able to sleep,"" said Iman Muhammad, whose neighborhood saw multiple fires set Friday night. Muhammad said she sympathized with peaceful protests over Floyd's death but disagreed with the violence: 'Wrong doesn't answer wrong."" Trump appeared to cheer on the tougher tactics Saturday night, commending the Guard deployment in Minneapolis, declaring 'No games!' and saying police in New York City 'must be allowed to do their job!' Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden condemned the violence as he continued to express common cause with those demonstrating after Floyd's death. 'The act of protesting should never be allowed to overshadow the reason we protest,' Biden said in a statement Saturday night. Overnight curfews were imposed in more than a dozen major cities nationwide, including Atlanta, Denver, Los Angeles, Minneapolis and Seattle. More than 1,300 people have been arrested in 16 cities since Thursday, including over 500 Friday in Los Angeles. The unrest comes at a time when most Americans have spent months inside over concerns surrounding the coronavirus, which the president has called an 'invisible enemy.' The events of the last 72 hours, seen live on national television, have shown the opposite: a sudden pivot to crowds, screaming protesters and burning buildings, and a stark contrast to the empty streets of recent months. 'Quite frankly I'm ready to just lock people up,"" Atlanta Police Chief Erika Shields said at a news conference. Demonstrations there turned violent Friday, and police were arresting protesters Saturday on blocked-off downtown streets. 'Yes, you caught us off balance once. It's not going to happen twice.' This week's unrest recalled the riots in Los Angeles nearly 30 years ago after the acquittal of the white police officers who beat Rodney King, a black motorist who had led them on a high-speed chase. The protests of Floyd's killing have gripped many more cities, but the losses in Minneapolis have yet to approach the staggering totals Los Angeles saw during five days of rioting in 1992, when more than 60 people died, 2,000-plus were injured and thousands arrested, with property damage topping $1 billion. Many protesters spoke of frustration that Floyd's death was one more in a litany. It came in the wake of the killing in Georgia of Ahmaud Arbery, a black man who was shot dead after being pursued by two white men while running in their neighborhood, and in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic that has thrown millions out of work, killed more than 100,000 people in the U.S. and disproportionately affected black people. The officer who held his knee to Floyd's neck as he begged for air was arrested Friday and charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. But many protesters are demanding the arrests of the three other officers involved. Trump stoked the anger on Twitter, saying that if protesters had breached the White House fence, they would 'have been greeted with the most vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons, I have ever seen.' Leaders in many affected cities have voiced outrage over Floyd's killing and expressed sympathy for protesters' concerns. But as the unrest intensified, they spoke of a desperate need to protect their cities and said they would call in reinforcements, despite concerns that could lead to more heavy-handed tactics. Governors in Georgia, Kentucky, Ohio and Texas also activated the National Guard after protests there turned violent. Police in St. Louis were investigating the death of a protester who climbed between two trailers of a Fed Ex truck and was killed when it drove away. And a person was killed in the area of protests in downtown Detroit just before midnight after someone fired shots into an SUV, officers said. Police had initially said someone fired into the crowd from an SUV. ___ Numerous AP journalists contributed from across the U.S.",0.0

Rosa Jimenez Cano said she planned to self-quarantine for 14 days, worrying she was perhaps 'irresponsible' when she attended Saturday night's protest in Miami, where she exposed herself to crowds of people. Protests over Floyd's death "" the latest in a series of killings of black men and women at the hands of police in America "" have shaken the country from Minneapolis to New York, from Atlanta to Los Angeles. Some turned into riots and clashes with police, leaving stores in flames and torched cars in the streets. Health experts fear that silent carriers of the virus could unwittingly infect others at protests where people are packed cheek to jowl, many without masks, many chanting, singing or shouting. The virus is dispersed by microscopic droplets in the air when people cough, sneeze, sing or talk. 'There's no question that, when you put hundreds or thousands of people together in close proximity, when we have got this virus all over the streets ... it's not healthy,"" Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan said Sunday on CNN's 'State of the Union.' ""Two weeks from now across America, we're going to find out whether or not this gives us a spike and drives the numbers back up again or not.' The U.S. has seen over 1.7 million infections and nearly 104,000 deaths in the pandemic, which has disproportionately affected racial minorities in a nation that does not have universal health care. Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser said Sunday she was very concerned that the protests in the nation's capital and elsewhere could provide fertile ground for a new series of outbreaks. Many of the protesters were wearing masks, but there were no attempts at social distancing. 'We've been working very hard in these last eight to 10 weeks to not have any mass gatherings,' she said. 'As a nation, we have to be concerned about a rebound.' Even the many protesters wearing masks are not guaranteed protection. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says cloth masks keep infected people from spreading the virus but are not designed to protect wearers from getting it. Mass protests in connection with Floyd's death were also being held in Europe. In London, thousands of people marched Sunday chanting 'No justice! No peace!' while carrying signs reading 'Justice for George Floyd' and 'Racism is a global issue.' Many demonstrators were not wearing masks and most in the crowd at Trafalgar Square were packed closely together. Britain has seen nearly 38,500 virus deaths, the second-highest in the world after the United States. In Berlin, hundreds of protesters picketed outside the U.S. Embassy on Saturday night under the motto: 'Justice for George Floyd.' Others marched near the U.S. embassy in Copenhagen, Denmark. Many Americans returned Sunday to in-person church services for the first time in weeks and tens of thousands of mosques reopened across the Middle East, but countries from India to Colombia still saw rising numbers of new infections. Nearly 6.1 million infections have been reported worldwide, with nearly 370,000 people dying, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. The true death toll is believed to be significantly higher, since many victims died of the virus without ever being tested. The situation worsened Sunday in India, where new daily cases topped 8,000 for the first time and 193 more deaths were reported. Despite that, India still is easing restrictions on shops and public transport in more states beginning Monday, although subways and schools will remain closed. In Saudi Arabia, mosques reopened Sunday for the first time in more than two months, but Islam's holiest site in Mecca remained closed. In Jerusalem, throngs of worshippers waited outside the Al-Aqsa Mosque before it reopened. Many wore surgical masks and waited for temperature checks as they entered. In Bogota, the capital of Colombia, authorities were locking down an area of nearly 1.5 million people as cases continued to rise. Mayor Claudia Lopez said no one in the working-class Kennedy area "" inaugurated by the late U.S. President John F.

City and state officials deployed thousands of National Guard soldiers, enacted strict curfews and shut down mass transit systems to slow protesters' movements, but that did little to stop parts of many cities from again erupting into mayhem. Protesters in Philadelphia hurled rocks and Molotov cocktails at police, officials said, while thieves in more than 20 California cities smashed their way into businesses and ran off with as much as they could carry "" boxes of sneakers, armloads of clothes, and cellphones, TVs and other electronics. In Minneapolis, a tanker truck driver drove into a massive crowd of demonstrators nearly a week after the death of George Floyd, a black man who pleaded for air as an officer pressed a knee into his neck. No protesters appeared to be injured, and the driver was arrested. Tensions spiked outside the White House, the scene of three days of demonstrations, where police fired tear gas and stun grenades into a crowd of more than 1,000 chanting protesters across the street in Lafayette Park. The crowd ran away and piled up road signs and plastic barriers to light a raging fire in a nearby street. Some pulled an American flag from a building and threw it into the blaze. A building in the park with bathrooms and a maintenance office went up in flames and people broke into banks and jewelry stores. As demonstrations persisted past curfew, Washington police said they were responding to multiple fires set around the capital. The entire Washington, D.C., National Guard "" roughly 1,700 soldiers "" was called in to help control the protests, according to two Defense Department officials who insisted on anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the matter. As the protests grew, President Donald Trump retweeted conservative commentator Buck Sexton who called for 'overwhelming force' against violent demonstrators. Secret Service agents had rushed Trump to a White House bunker on Friday night as hundreds of protesters gathered outside the executive mansion, some of them throwing rocks and tugging at police barricades. The president spent nearly an hour in the bunker designed for use in emergencies like terrorist attacks, according to a Republican close to the White House who was not authorized to publicly discuss private matters and spoke on condition of anonymity. The account was confirmed by an administration official who also spoke on condition of anonymity. Former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, visited the site of protests in his hometown of Wilmington, Delaware, and talked to some of the demonstrators. He also wrote a post on Medium expressing empathy for those despairing about the killing of George Floyd. At least 4,400 people have been arrested over days of protests, according to a tally compiled by The Associated Press. Arrests ranged from stealing and blocking highways to breaking curfew. In Salt Lake City, an activist leader condemned the destruction of property but said broken buildings shouldn't be mourned on the same level as black men like Floyd. 'Maybe this country will get the memo that we are sick of police murdering unarmed black men,' said Lex Scott, founder of Black Lives Matter Utah. 'Maybe the next time a white police officer decides to pull the trigger, he will picture cities burning.' Yet thousands still marched peacefully in Phoenix, Albuquerque and other cities, with some calling for an end to the fires, vandalism and theft, saying it weakened calls for justice and reform. 'They keep killing our people,' said Mahira Louis, 15, who marched with her mother and several hundred others in a peaceful protest through downtown Boston. 'I'm so sick and tired of it.' But as night fell that demonstration also descended into violence, with some protesters throwing rocks, bricks and glass bottles at officers and lighting a police vehicle on fire. In downtown Atlanta, authorities fired tear gas to disperse hundreds of demonstrators. Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said two officers had been fired and three placed on desk duty after video showed police surrounding a car Saturday, then pulling a woman out of the passenger seat and appearing to use a stun gun on a man who was driving. Police Chief Erika Shields called it 'really shocking to watch.' In downtown Los Angeles, a police SUV accelerated into several protesters in a street, knocking two people to the ground. The pair got up and ran onto the sidewalk. Nearby in Santa Monica, not far from a peaceful demonstration, a group broke into a Gap and a Vans sneaker store, where people walked out with boxes of shoes. Others shattered the windows of an REI outdoor supply store and snatched folding chairs, a bike and backpacks. A fire broke out at a restaurant across the street. About 30 miles (48 kilometers) south, as hundreds of protesters gathered in Long Beach, scores of thieves swarmed into nearby outlet stores. A steady stream emerged from a Forever 21 store carrying armloads of clothing. Some hauled it away in garbage bags, and a few stopped outside to change into stolen items. In Minneapolis, the officer who pressed his knee onto Floyd's neck has been charged with murder, but protesters are demanding the other three officers at the scene be prosecuted. All four were fired. 'We're not done,' said Darnella Wade, an organizer for Black Lives Matter in neighboring St. Paul, where thousands gathered peacefully in front of the state Capitol as state patrolmen and National Guard soldiers lined up in front of about a dozen military-style armored vehicles. ""They sent us the military, and we only asked them for arrests.' Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz brought in thousands of National Guard soldiers on Saturday to help quell violence that had damaged or destroyed hundreds of buildings in Minneapolis over days of protests. That appeared to help minimize unrest both Saturday and Sunday. Disgust over generations of racism in a country founded by slaveholders combined with a string of recent racially charged killings to stoke the anger. Adding to that was angst from months of lockdowns brought on by the coronavirus pandemic, which has disproportionately hurt communities of color, not only in terms of infections but in job losses and economic stress. The droves of people congregating for demonstrations threatened to trigger new outbreaks, a fact overshadowed by the boiling tensions. The scale of the coast-to-coast protests rivaled the historic demonstrations of the civil rights and Vietnam War eras. Curfews were imposed in major cities around the U.S., including Atlanta, Chicago, Denver, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Seattle. About 5,000 National Guard soldiers and airmen were activated in 15 states and Washington, D.C. In Indianapolis, two people were reported dead in bursts of downtown violence this weekend, adding to deaths reported in Detroit and Minneapolis in recent days. In tweets Sunday, Trump blamed anarchists and the media for fueling violence. Attorney General William Barr pointed a finger at 'far left extremist' groups. Police chiefs and politicians accused outsiders of coming in and causing the problems. At the Minneapolis intersection where Floyd was killed, people gathered with brooms and flowers, saying it was important to protect what they called a 'sacred space.' Among in Minneapolis was Michael Brown Sr., the father of Michael Brown, whose killing by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, set off unrest in 2014. 'I understand what this family is feeling. I understand what this community is feeling,' he said. ___ Morrison and Sullivan reported from Minneapolis.

The crowd ran away and piled up road signs and plastic barriers to light a raging fire in a nearby street. Some pulled an American flag from a building and threw it into the blaze. A building in the park with bathrooms and a maintenance office went up in flames and people broke into banks and jewelry stores. As demonstrations persisted past curfew, Washington police said they were responding to multiple fires set around the capital. The entire Washington, D.C., National Guard "" roughly 1,700 soldiers "" was called in to help control the protests, according to two Defense Department officials who insisted on anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the matter. As the protests grew, President Donald Trump retweeted conservative commentator Buck Sexton who called for 'overwhelming force' against violent demonstrators. Secret Service agents had rushed Trump to a White House bunker on Friday night as hundreds of protesters gathered outside the executive mansion, some of them throwing rocks and tugging at police barricades. The president spent nearly an hour in the bunker designed for use in emergencies like terrorist attacks, according to a Republican close to the White House who was not authorized to publicly discuss private matters and spoke on condition of anonymity. The account was confirmed by an administration official who also spoke on condition of anonymity. Former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, visited the site of protests in his hometown of Wilmington, Delaware, and talked to some of the demonstrators. He also wrote a post on Medium expressing empathy for those despairing about the killing of George Floyd. At least 4,400 people have been arrested over days of protests, according to a tally compiled by The Associated Press. Arrests ranged from stealing and blocking highways to breaking curfew. In Salt Lake City, an activist leader condemned the destruction of property but said broken buildings shouldn't be mourned on the same level as black men like Floyd. 'Maybe this country will get the memo that we are sick of police murdering unarmed black men,' said Lex Scott, founder of Black Lives Matter Utah. 'Maybe the next time a white police officer decides to pull the trigger, he will picture cities burning.' Yet thousands still marched peacefully in Phoenix, Albuquerque and other cities, with some calling for an end to the fires, vandalism and theft, saying it weakened calls for justice and reform. 'They keep killing our people,' said Mahira Louis, 15, who marched with her mother and several hundred others in a peaceful protest through downtown Boston. 'I'm so sick and tired of it.' But as night fell that demonstration also descended into violence, with some protesters throwing rocks, bricks and glass bottles at officers and lighting a police vehicle on fire. In downtown Atlanta, authorities fired tear gas to disperse hundreds of demonstrators. Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said two officers had been fired and three placed on desk duty after video showed police surrounding a car Saturday, then pulling a woman out of the passenger seat and appearing to use a stun gun on a man who was driving. Police Chief Erika Shields called it 'really shocking to watch.' In downtown Los Angeles, a police SUV accelerated into several protesters in a street, knocking two people to the ground. The pair got up and ran onto the sidewalk. Nearby in Santa Monica, not far from a peaceful demonstration, a group broke into a Gap and a Vans sneaker store, where people walked out with boxes of shoes. Others shattered the windows of an REI outdoor supply store and snatched folding chairs, a bike and backpacks. A fire broke out at a restaurant across the street. About 30 miles (48 kilometers) south, as hundreds of protesters gathered in Long Beach, scores of thieves swarmed into nearby outlet stores. A steady stream emerged from a Forever 21 store carrying armloads of clothing. Some hauled it away in garbage bags, and a few stopped outside to change into stolen items. In Minneapolis, the officer who pressed his knee onto Floyd's neck has been charged with murder, but protesters are demanding the other three officers at the scene be prosecuted. All four were fired. 'We're not done,' said Darnella Wade, an organizer for Black Lives Matter in neighboring St. Paul, where thousands gathered peacefully in front of the state Capitol as state patrolmen and National Guard soldiers lined up in front of about a dozen military-style armored vehicles.

City and state officials deployed thousands of National Guard soldiers, enacted strict curfews and shut down mass transit systems to slow protesters' movements, but that did little to stop parts of many cities from again erupting into mayhem. Protesters in Philadelphia hurled rocks and Molotov cocktails at police, officials said, while thieves in more than 20 California cities smashed their way into businesses and ran off with as much as they could carry "" boxes of sneakers, armloads of clothes, and cellphones, TVs and other electronics. In Minneapolis, a tanker truck driver drove into a massive crowd of demonstrators nearly a week after the death of George Floyd, a black man who pleaded for air as an officer pressed a knee into his neck. No protesters appeared to be injured, and the driver was arrested. Tensions spiked outside the White House, the scene of three days of demonstrations, where police fired tear gas and stun grenades into a crowd of more than 1,000 chanting protesters across the street in Lafayette Park.

'After consultation with the California Highway Patrol and Office of Emergency Services, the decision was made this evening to advise all state departments with offices in downtown city areas to close tomorrow, and to notify staff of the decision,' said Amy Palmer, a spokeswoman for the state Government Operations Agency. The directive was sent Sunday evening and it was left up to officials at individual agencies to determine which buildings should be closed. A state Department of Justice memo sent to employees said the attorney general's offices in Sacramento, Oakland, San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego would be closed, though employees who can work from home should do so. 'Staff assigned to these offices should not report to work for any reason. Staff who are able to telework should continue to do so despite the office closures,' the memo said. ___ PORTLAND, Ore. "" Police in Portland deployed tear gas to disperse a large crowd downtown late Sunday night after authorities said projectiles were thrown at officers. Earlier, police said protesters smashed windows at the federal courthouse, and authorities on loudspeakers declared the gathering a civil disturbance. Thousands of people marched throughout Oregon's largest city on Sunday, the third day of George Floyd protests in Portland. For much of the afternoon and evening protesters were largely peaceful, but there were reports of increased violence directed at police into the night. ___ SEOUL, South Korea "" North Korea's official Rodong Sinmun newspaper on Monday reported the demonstrations across the United States in reaction to the death of George Floyd, saying protesters 'harshly condemned' a white police officer's 'lawless and brutal murder' of a black citizen. The article, published with photos, said hundreds of protesters gathered in front of the White House chanting 'No justice, no peace.' It also said there were demonstrations in Minneapolis, New York, Denver, Chicago, Los Angeles and Memphis and that the protests were expected to grow further. ___ Several thousand people marched Monday in New Zealand's largest city, Auckland, to protest George Floyd's death and show solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement. The protesters marched from Aotea Square to the U.S. consulate, where they kneeled. They held banners with slogans such as 'I can't breathe' and 'The Real Virus is Racism.' Hundreds more joined protests and vigils elsewhere in the country, on a day that was a public holiday. The protests were peaceful. Protesters said they were also standing up against police violence and racism in New Zealand. ___ CHARLOTTE, N.C. "" More than 15 people were arrested during protests in Charlotte on Sunday night, the city's police department said. Police said four demonstrators were arrested for assaulting officers, including one for hitting an officer with a rock. Three others were arrested on illegal weapon charges, police said. ___ KANSAS CITY, Missouri "" Shortly after local officials praised what had been a peaceful protest in Kansas City, Missouri, police fired tear gas into the crowd after some demonstrators began lobbing water bottles, law enforcement officials said. A large crowd had gathered at County Club plaza and police had allowed it to slowly dissipate after the city's 8 p.m. curfew took effect. But police used stronger tactics against the smaller crowd that remained when rocks and water bottles started flying and two television station news vehicles were smashed and set on fire. Police declared the scene an 'unlawful assembly' and said the area was clear of activity by midnight. ___ OLYMPIA, Wash. "" Washington Gov. Jay Inslee late Sunday ordered a statewide activation of the National Guard following vandalism and stealing in stores and shopping malls in multiple cities. Inslee had previously authorized 400 troops for Seattle and 200 for Bellevue. On Saturday night people smashed downtown Seattle store fronts and stole items from many businesses, tossing mannequins into the street. On Sunday there were break-ins and thefts in stores and shopping malls in Bellevue, Spokane, Tukwila and Renton. Inslee's activation means more troops will be used to help control unrest. 'We must not let these illegal and dangerous actions detract from the anger so many feel at the deep injustice laid so ugly and bare by the death of George Floyd,' Inslee said in a statement. 'But we also will not turn away from our responsibility to protect the residents of our state.' ___ WASHINGTON "" Break-ins and stealing were rampant in downtown Washington and elsewhere in the city as protests over George Floyd's death turned violent for a third straight night. Protesters broke into a branch of Capital Bank, and empty jewelry boxes could be seen scattered on the sidewalk outside a Mervis Diamonds store. After protesters broke into a La Colombe coffee shop, someone in the crowd yelled, 'What are you looting a coffee shop for? You're messing up the whole message."" ___ NEW YORK "" The mayor of New York City's own daughter is one of the nearly 790 people who have been arrested in the city since protests over the death of George Floyd began last week. A law enforcement official who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter tells The Associated Press that 25-year-old Chiara de Blasio was arrested Saturday night. An arrest report obtained by The New York Post says she refused to leave a Manhattan street ordered cleared by officers because people were throwing things. Chiara de Blasio, who is black, was later given a court summons and released. Mayor Bill de Blasio, who is white, didn't mention the arrest in his Sunday press briefing. City Hall spokespeople didn't have an immediate comment. "" By Michael R. Sisak ___ AUSTIN, Texas "" Police fired rubber bullets and pepper spray late Sunday night at demonstrators who gathered outside the downtown police station in Austin. Live television cameras on Spectrum News showed officers firing several shots into the crowd and several people on the ground. Some people could be seen throwing water bottles at police. The officers were stationed above the crowd on the steps of the police station and a raised section of Interstate 35. Unlike Dallas, where police made dozens of arrests to enforce a downtown curfew, Austin doesn't have a curfew and demonstrators have been roaming downtown from the police station to the state Capitol several blocks away for nearly 10 hours. The crowd has ebbed and flowed from a few thousand to a few hundred. Demonstrators could not get on the Capitol grounds, which were protected by a large police presence. ___ DENVER "" Police fired tear gas and projectiles at demonstrators defying a Denver curfew Sunday night following a day of peaceful marching and chants of 'Don't shoot' alongside boarded-up businesses that had been vandalized the night before. Dozens of demonstrators, some throwing fireworks, taunted police and pushed dumpsters onto Colfax Avenue, a major artery, in the sporadic confrontations that occurred east of downtown. The demonstration over the death of George Floyd came after turbulent protests that led to the arrest of 83 people Saturday night. Denver Mayor Michael Hancock called the behavior of unruly protesters 'reckless, inexcusable and unacceptable.' ___ PHOENIX "" Protests held Sunday night in downtown Phoenix appeared to be peaceful, according to local media reports. An hour before a curfew went into effect, activist Armonee Jackson told protesters in the parking lot of an art gallery downtown that they should avoid any violence, The Arizona Republic reported. 'Listen to me: We are not ending in violence. I refuse to end in violence,' Jackson told the crowd. David Riutta told the newspaper that he came out to protest police brutality and wants to see a panel of civilians investigate officers' use-of-force cases. ___ WASHINGTON "" As demonstrations continued past an 11 p.m. curfew, D.C. police said they were responding to multiple fires that were 'intentionally set' around the city. One was at St. John's Episcopal Church, which is located across Lafayette Park from the White House. The church says every president beginning with James Madison, 'until the present,' has attended a service at the church, giving it the nickname, 'the church of presidents.' The first services at the church were held in 1816, according to its website. ___ WASHINGTON "" The entire Washington, D.C., National Guard "" roughly 1,700 soldiers "" is being called in to help with the response to protests outside the White House and elsewhere in the nation's capital, according to two Defense Department officials. Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser said Sunday she had requested 500 Guardsman to assist local law enforcement. Later on Sunday, as the protests escalated, Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy ordered the rest of the Guardsman "" about 1,200 soldiers "" to report. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the matter. The D.C. National Guard did not reply to a request from The Associated Press for comment. - By James LaPorta ___ WASHINGTON "" Protesters started fires near the White House as tensions with police mounted during a third straight night of demonstrations held in response to the death of George Floyd at police hands in Minnesota. An hour before the 11 p.m. curfew, police fired a major barrage of tear gas stun grenades into the crowd of more than 1,000 people, largely clearing Lafayette Park across the street from the White House and scattering protesters into the street. Protesters piled up road signs and plastic barriers and lit a raging fire in the middle of H Street. Some pulled an American flag from a nearby building and threw it into the blaze. Others added branches pulled from trees. A cinder block structure, on the north side of the park, that had bathrooms and a maintenance office, was engulfed in flames. As the curfew hit, police sealed the perimeter of the park. Shortly beforehand, police pushed a crowd of about 300 demonstrators several blocks with a series of charges with batons and riot shields. Enraged protesters screamed, 'Who do you serve? Who do you protect?' Police shot pepper powders point black at several protesters. Several miles north, a separate protest broke out in Northwest D.C., near the Maryland border. The Metropolitan Police Department says there were break-ins at a Target and a shopping center that houses Neiman Marcus, Saks Fifth Avenue Men's Store, T.J. Maxx, a movie theater and specialty stores. Police say several individuals have been detained. ___ At least 4,100 people have been arrested over days of protests across the country since George Floyd's death Monday, according to a tally compiled by The Associated Press. Arrests ranged from thefts to blocking highways and breaking curfew. The arrest figures as of 11 p.m. EST on Sunday included those from demonstrations in New York and Philadelphia on the East Coast, Chicago and Dallas in the Midwest and Southwest, and Los Angeles on the West Coast as protests take place all over the county. In Dallas, police began sweeping downtown streets with arrests to enforce a curfew that went into effect at 7 p.m. ___ CHARLOTTE, N.C. "" Michael Jordan is 'deeply saddened, truly pained and plain angry.' With protesters taking to the streets across the United States again Sunday, Jordan released a statement on George Floyd and the killings of black people at the hands of police. 'I am deeply saddened, truly pained and plain angry,' the former NBA star and current Charlotte Hornets owner said in the statement posted on the Jordan brand's social media accounts and the team's Twitter account. 'I see and feel everyone's pain, outrage and frustration. I stand with those who are calling out the ingrained racism and violence toward people of color in our country. We have had enough. 'I don't have the answers, but our collective voices show strength and the inability to be divided by others. We must listen to each other, show compassion and empathy and never turn our backs on senseless brutality. We need to continue peaceful expressions against injustice and demand accountability. Our unified voice needs to put pressure on our leaders to change our laws, or else we need to use our vote to create systemic change. Every one of us needs to be part of the solution, and we must work together to ensure justice for all. 'My heart goes out to the family of George Floyd and to the countless others whose lives have been brutally and senselessly taken through acts of racism and injustice.' ___ BOSTON "" A Sunday afternoon of mostly peaceful protests in Boston broke at nightfall when demonstrators clashed with officers, throwing rocks, breaking into several stores and lighting a police vehicle on fire. Boston police tweeted that at least 40 people had been arrested as of 3 a.m. Monday. Police said seven police officers had been hospitalized and 21 police cruisers were damaged. A National Guard unit was called in to help quell the unrest. Republican Gov. Charlie Baker called the violence 'criminal and cowardly' in a tweet. The nighttime destruction was a stark contrast to the several protests earlier Sunday that featured thousands of demonstrators marching peacefully. ___ ATLANTA "" Riot police firing volleys of tear gas dispersed hundreds of demonstrators as a curfew took hold Sunday night, scattering a crowd that had protested for hours in downtown Atlanta over the deaths of George Floyd in Minnesota and Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia. Hundreds of police, National Guard troops and other forces lined up in positions around downtown Centennial Park, a focal point of the weekend of protests. An overnight curfew took hold at 9 p.m. as some on the fringes of what was a largely peaceful afternoon protest were setting off fireworks and burning construction materials near the park. An Associated Press photographer saw police then begin firing many 40 millimeter canisters of tear gas toward the crowd. People were choking, gasping and some throwing up as they scattered, leaving only a few still in the streets. As police and National Guard troops took up positions with plastic shields on major streets, crowds melted away. WSB-TV showed footage about an hour later of officers taking people who lingered in the streets into custody, using plastic ties to handcuff them on street corners. ___ WASHINGTON "" Secret Service agents rushed President Donald Trump to an underground bunker Friday, as hundreds of protesters gathered outside the White House, some throwing rocks and tugging at police barricades just outside the executive mansion. That's according to a Republican close to the White House not authorized to publicly discuss private matters and confirmed by another official. The abrupt decision by the agents underscored the rattled mood inside the White House, where the chants from Lafayette Park could be heard all weekend and Secret Service agents and law enforcement officers struggled to contain the crowds. The Friday protests, triggered by the death of George Floyd, a black man who died after he was pinned at the neck by a white Minneapolis police officer, turned violent and appeared to catch officers by surprise. It sparked one of the highest alerts on the White House complex since the Sept. 11 attacks in 2001. In the days since, security at the White House has been reinforced by the National Guard and additional personnel from the Secret Service and the U.S. Park Police. On Sunday, the Justice Department also deployed members of the U.S. Marshals Service and agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration to supplement national guard troops outside the White House, according to a senior Justice Department official. The official could not discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. "" By Jonathan Lemire and Zeke Miller",0.0

On Sunday there were break-ins and thefts in stores and shopping malls in Bellevue, Spokane, Tukwila and Renton. Inslee's activation means more troops will be used to help control unrest. 'We must not let these illegal and dangerous actions detract from the anger so many feel at the deep injustice laid so ugly and bare by the death of George Floyd,' Inslee said in a statement. 'But we also will not turn away from our responsibility to protect the residents of our state.' ___ WASHINGTON "" Break-ins and stealing were rampant in downtown Washington and elsewhere in the city as protests over George Floyd's death turned violent for a third straight night. Protesters broke into a branch of Capital Bank, and empty jewelry boxes could be seen scattered on the sidewalk outside a Mervis Diamonds store. After protesters broke into a La Colombe coffee shop, someone in the crowd yelled, 'What are you looting a coffee shop for? You're messing up the whole message."" ___ NEW YORK "" The mayor of New York City's own daughter is one of the nearly 790 people who have been arrested in the city since protests over the death of George Floyd began last week. A law enforcement official who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter tells The Associated Press that 25-year-old Chiara de Blasio was arrested Saturday night. An arrest report obtained by The New York Post says she refused to leave a Manhattan street ordered cleared by officers because people were throwing things. Chiara de Blasio, who is black, was later given a court summons and released. Mayor Bill de Blasio, who is white, didn't mention the arrest in his Sunday press briefing. City Hall spokespeople didn't have an immediate comment. "" By Michael R. Sisak ___ AUSTIN, Texas "" Police fired rubber bullets and pepper spray late Sunday night at demonstrators who gathered outside the downtown police station in Austin. Live television cameras on Spectrum News showed officers firing several shots into the crowd and several people on the ground. Some people could be seen throwing water bottles at police. The officers were stationed above the crowd on the steps of the police station and a raised section of Interstate 35. Unlike Dallas, where police made dozens of arrests to enforce a downtown curfew, Austin doesn't have a curfew and demonstrators have been roaming downtown from the police station to the state Capitol several blocks away for nearly 10 hours. The crowd has ebbed and flowed from a few thousand to a few hundred. Demonstrators could not get on the Capitol grounds, which were protected by a large police presence. ___ DENVER "" Police fired tear gas and projectiles at demonstrators defying a Denver curfew Sunday night following a day of peaceful marching and chants of 'Don't shoot' alongside boarded-up businesses that had been vandalized the night before. Dozens of demonstrators, some throwing fireworks, taunted police and pushed dumpsters onto Colfax Avenue, a major artery, in the sporadic confrontations that occurred east of downtown. The demonstration over the death of George Floyd came after turbulent protests that led to the arrest of 83 people Saturday night. Denver Mayor Michael Hancock called the behavior of unruly protesters 'reckless, inexcusable and unacceptable.' ___ PHOENIX "" Protests held Sunday night in downtown Phoenix appeared to be peaceful, according to local media reports. An hour before a curfew went into effect, activist Armonee Jackson told protesters in the parking lot of an art gallery downtown that they should avoid any violence, The Arizona Republic reported. 'Listen to me: We are not ending in violence. I refuse to end in violence,' Jackson told the crowd. David Riutta told the newspaper that he came out to protest police brutality and wants to see a panel of civilians investigate officers' use-of-force cases. ___ WASHINGTON "" As demonstrations continued past an 11 p.m. curfew, D.C. police said they were responding to multiple fires that were 'intentionally set' around the city. One was at St. John's Episcopal Church, which is located across Lafayette Park from the White House. The church says every president beginning with James Madison, 'until the present,' has attended a service at the church, giving it the nickname, 'the church of presidents.' The first services at the church were held in 1816, according to its website. ___ WASHINGTON "" The entire Washington, D.C., National Guard "" roughly 1,700 soldiers "" is being called in to help with the response to protests outside the White House and elsewhere in the nation's capital, according to two Defense Department officials. Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser said Sunday she had requested 500 Guardsman to assist local law enforcement. Later on Sunday, as the protests escalated, Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy ordered the rest of the Guardsman "" about 1,200 soldiers "" to report. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the matter. The D.C. National Guard did not reply to a request from The Associated Press for comment. - By James LaPorta ___ WASHINGTON "" Protesters started fires near the White House as tensions with police mounted during a third straight night of demonstrations held in response to the death of George Floyd at police hands in Minnesota. An hour before the 11 p.m. curfew, police fired a major barrage of tear gas stun grenades into the crowd of more than 1,000 people, largely clearing Lafayette Park across the street from the White House and scattering protesters into the street. Protesters piled up road signs and plastic barriers and lit a raging fire in the middle of H Street. Some pulled an American flag from a nearby building and threw it into the blaze. Others added branches pulled from trees. A cinder block structure, on the north side of the park, that had bathrooms and a maintenance office, was engulfed in flames. As the curfew hit, police sealed the perimeter of the park. Shortly beforehand, police pushed a crowd of about 300 demonstrators several blocks with a series of charges with batons and riot shields. Enraged protesters screamed, 'Who do you serve? Who do you protect?' Police shot pepper powders point black at several protesters. Several miles north, a separate protest broke out in Northwest D.C., near the Maryland border. The Metropolitan Police Department says there were break-ins at a Target and a shopping center that houses Neiman Marcus, Saks Fifth Avenue Men's Store, T.J. Maxx, a movie theater and specialty stores. Police say several individuals have been detained. ___ At least 4,100 people have been arrested over days of protests across the country since George Floyd's death Monday, according to a tally compiled by The Associated Press. Arrests ranged from thefts to blocking highways and breaking curfew. The arrest figures as of 11 p.m. EST on Sunday included those from demonstrations in New York and Philadelphia on the East Coast, Chicago and Dallas in the Midwest and Southwest, and Los Angeles on the West Coast as protests take place all over the county. In Dallas, police began sweeping downtown streets with arrests to enforce a curfew that went into effect at 7 p.m. ___ CHARLOTTE, N.C. "" Michael Jordan is 'deeply saddened, truly pained and plain angry.' With protesters taking to the streets across the United States again Sunday, Jordan released a statement on George Floyd and the killings of black people at the hands of police. 'I am deeply saddened, truly pained and plain angry,' the former NBA star and current Charlotte Hornets owner said in the statement posted on the Jordan brand's social media accounts and the team's Twitter account. 'I see and feel everyone's pain, outrage and frustration. I stand with those who are calling out the ingrained racism and violence toward people of color in our country. We have had enough. 'I don't have the answers, but our collective voices show strength and the inability to be divided by others. We must listen to each other, show compassion and empathy and never turn our backs on senseless brutality. We need to continue peaceful expressions against injustice and demand accountability. Our unified voice needs to put pressure on our leaders to change our laws, or else we need to use our vote to create systemic change. Every one of us needs to be part of the solution, and we must work together to ensure justice for all. 'My heart goes out to the family of George Floyd and to the countless others whose lives have been brutally and senselessly taken through acts of racism and injustice.' ___ BOSTON "" A Sunday afternoon of mostly peaceful protests in Boston broke at nightfall when demonstrators clashed with officers, throwing rocks, breaking into several stores and lighting a police vehicle on fire. Boston police tweeted that at least 40 people had been arrested as of 3 a.m. Monday. Police said seven police officers had been hospitalized and 21 police cruisers were damaged. A National Guard unit was called in to help quell the unrest. Republican Gov. Charlie Baker called the violence 'criminal and cowardly' in a tweet. The nighttime destruction was a stark contrast to the several protests earlier Sunday that featured thousands of demonstrators marching peacefully. ___ ATLANTA "" Riot police firing volleys of tear gas dispersed hundreds of demonstrators as a curfew took hold Sunday night, scattering a crowd that had protested for hours in downtown Atlanta over the deaths of George Floyd in Minnesota and Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia. Hundreds of police, National Guard troops and other forces lined up in positions around downtown Centennial Park, a focal point of the weekend of protests. An overnight curfew took hold at 9 p.m. as some on the fringes of what was a largely peaceful afternoon protest were setting off fireworks and burning construction materials near the park. An Associated Press photographer saw police then begin firing many 40 millimeter canisters of tear gas toward the crowd. People were choking, gasping and some throwing up as they scattered, leaving only a few still in the streets. As police and National Guard troops took up positions with plastic shields on major streets, crowds melted away. WSB-TV showed footage about an hour later of officers taking people who lingered in the streets into custody, using plastic ties to handcuff them on street corners. ___ WASHINGTON "" Secret Service agents rushed President Donald Trump to an underground bunker Friday, as hundreds of protesters gathered outside the White House, some throwing rocks and tugging at police barricades just outside the executive mansion. That's according to a Republican close to the White House not authorized to publicly discuss private matters and confirmed by another official. The abrupt decision by the agents underscored the rattled mood inside the White House, where the chants from Lafayette Park could be heard all weekend and Secret Service agents and law enforcement officers struggled to contain the crowds. The Friday protests, triggered by the death of George Floyd, a black man who died after he was pinned at the neck by a white Minneapolis police officer, turned violent and appeared to catch officers by surprise. It sparked one of the highest alerts on the White House complex since the Sept. 11 attacks in 2001. In the days since, security at the White House has been reinforced by the National Guard and additional personnel from the Secret Service and the U.S. Park Police. On Sunday, the Justice Department also deployed members of the U.S. Marshals Service and agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration to supplement national guard troops outside the White House, according to a senior Justice Department official. The official could not discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. "" By Jonathan Lemire and Zeke Miller",0.0

National Guard did not reply to a request from The Associated Press for comment. - By James LaPorta ___ WASHINGTON "" Protesters started fires near the White House as tensions with police mounted during a third straight night of demonstrations held in response to the death of George Floyd at police hands in Minnesota. An hour before the 11 p.m. curfew, police fired a major barrage of tear gas stun grenades into the crowd of more than 1,000 people, largely clearing Lafayette Park across the street from the White House and scattering protesters into the street. Protesters piled up road signs and plastic barriers and lit a raging fire in the middle of H Street. Some pulled an American flag from a nearby building and threw it into the blaze. Others added branches pulled from trees. A cinder block structure, on the north side of the park, that had bathrooms and a maintenance office, was engulfed in flames. As the curfew hit, police sealed the perimeter of the park. Shortly beforehand, police pushed a crowd of about 300 demonstrators several blocks with a series of charges with batons and riot shields. Enraged protesters screamed, 'Who do you serve? Who do you protect?' Police shot pepper powders point black at several protesters. Several miles north, a separate protest broke out in Northwest D.C., near the Maryland border. The Metropolitan Police Department says there were break-ins at a Target and a shopping center that houses Neiman Marcus, Saks Fifth Avenue Men's Store, T.J. Maxx, a movie theater and specialty stores. Police say several individuals have been detained. ___ At least 4,100 people have been arrested over days of protests across the country since George Floyd's death Monday, according to a tally compiled by The Associated Press. Arrests ranged from thefts to blocking highways and breaking curfew. The arrest figures as of 11 p.m. EST on Sunday included those from demonstrations in New York and Philadelphia on the East Coast, Chicago and Dallas in the Midwest and Southwest, and Los Angeles on the West Coast as protests take place all over the county. In Dallas, police began sweeping downtown streets with arrests to enforce a curfew that went into effect at 7 p.m. ___ CHARLOTTE, N.C. "" Michael Jordan is 'deeply saddened, truly pained and plain angry.' With protesters taking to the streets across the United States again Sunday, Jordan released a statement on George Floyd and the killings of black people at the hands of police. 'I am deeply saddened, truly pained and plain angry,' the former NBA star and current Charlotte Hornets owner said in the statement posted on the Jordan brand's social media accounts and the team's Twitter account. 'I see and feel everyone's pain, outrage and frustration. I stand with those who are calling out the ingrained racism and violence toward people of color in our country. We have had enough. 'I don't have the answers, but our collective voices show strength and the inability to be divided by others. We must listen to each other, show compassion and empathy and never turn our backs on senseless brutality. We need to continue peaceful expressions against injustice and demand accountability. Our unified voice needs to put pressure on our leaders to change our laws, or else we need to use our vote to create systemic change. Every one of us needs to be part of the solution, and we must work together to ensure justice for all. 'My heart goes out to the family of George Floyd and to the countless others whose lives have been brutally and senselessly taken through acts of racism and injustice.' ___ BOSTON "" A Sunday afternoon of mostly peaceful protests in Boston broke at nightfall when demonstrators clashed with officers, throwing rocks, breaking into several stores and lighting a police vehicle on fire. Boston police tweeted that at least 40 people had been arrested as of 3 a.m. Monday. Police said seven police officers had been hospitalized and 21 police cruisers were damaged. A National Guard unit was called in to help quell the unrest. Republican Gov. Charlie Baker called the violence 'criminal and cowardly' in a tweet. The nighttime destruction was a stark contrast to the several protests earlier Sunday that featured thousands of demonstrators marching peacefully. ___ ATLANTA "" Riot police firing volleys of tear gas dispersed hundreds of demonstrators as a curfew took hold Sunday night, scattering a crowd that had protested for hours in downtown Atlanta over the deaths of George Floyd in Minnesota and Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia. Hundreds of police, National Guard troops and other forces lined up in positions around downtown Centennial Park, a focal point of the weekend of protests. An overnight curfew took hold at 9 p.m. as some on the fringes of what was a largely peaceful afternoon protest were setting off fireworks and burning construction materials near the park. An Associated Press photographer saw police then begin firing many 40 millimeter canisters of tear gas toward the crowd. People were choking, gasping and some throwing up as they scattered, leaving only a few still in the streets. As police and National Guard troops took up positions with plastic shields on major streets, crowds melted away. WSB-TV showed footage about an hour later of officers taking people who lingered in the streets into custody, using plastic ties to handcuff them on street corners. ___ WASHINGTON "" Secret Service agents rushed President Donald Trump to an underground bunker Friday, as hundreds of protesters gathered outside the White House, some throwing rocks and tugging at police barricades just outside the executive mansion. That's according to a Republican close to the White House not authorized to publicly discuss private matters and confirmed by another official. The abrupt decision by the agents underscored the rattled mood inside the White House, where the chants from Lafayette Park could be heard all weekend and Secret Service agents and law enforcement officers struggled to contain the crowds. The Friday protests, triggered by the death of George Floyd, a black man who died after he was pinned at the neck by a white Minneapolis police officer, turned violent and appeared to catch officers by surprise. It sparked one of the highest alerts on the White House complex since the Sept. 11 attacks in 2001. In the days since, security at the White House has been reinforced by the National Guard and additional personnel from the Secret Service and the U.S. Park Police. On Sunday, the Justice Department also deployed members of the U.S. Marshals Service and agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration to supplement national guard troops outside the White House, according to a senior Justice Department official. The official could not discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. "" By Jonathan Lemire and Zeke Miller",0.0

As they marched, they chanted the names of Black men and women who were killed by police officers around the country. And when they marched to the State House, the crowd gained another thousand followers, holding signs and chanting, “Black lives matter!” and “No justice, no peace!” as stopped motorists honked their support. PROVIDENCE — More than a thousand people of all ages and races rallied Saturday in Burnside Park carrying handmade signs demanding justice for George Floyd, the Black man who died Monday after a white Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck — and the end of police brutality. Advertisement They weren’t there to “burn down Rhode Island,” as one of the rally organizers put it, referring to the violence and riots in other cities. But they’ve had enough: of police brutality, of racism, of white supremacy. And they were not alone. For some, that realization was the best part of the rally. Justin Alves, who is Black and lives in Cranston, stood in front of the State House with his wife, 16-year-old daughter, and 11-year-old son, holding signs reading “Enough is Enough,” “I Can’t Breathe,” and “Black Lives Matter.” “We have a nation divided now, but seeing the amount of people that came out, from every race, it’s not going to happen here, at least not in the state of Rhode Island,” he said. “I see the city sticking together, and I love what I see today.” Nadim Robinson, who is Black and lives in Providence, told the crowd about being abused by the police when he was a teenager in Maryland. He urged protesters to hold onto the energy from the rally. Advertisement “This is amazing,” Robinson said of the gathering. “I’ve been a part of protests before, but I’ve never seen anything like this. The racial mixture is amazing. We’re here and we’re not violent.” Representative David N. Cicilline held a sign that read “Enough is Enough” and listed the names of Black men who’ve been killed, including Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, and Eric Garner. “I thought it was important today to join my community, to be here to express the pain that I think everyone is feeling in witnessing the murder of George Floyd,” he said. “To say that we as a community will not tolerate violence against members of the African-American community. We have a responsibility to speak out.” Cicilline, a former Providence mayor who is now chairman of the Democratic Policy and Communications Committee, criticized President Trump’s tweet “when the looting starts, the shooting starts” in response to the protests in Minneapolis. “We expect a leader to bring us together, to speak to our higher angels, to talk about our shared values,” he said. “Instead he exploits it as a way to rile up what he sees as his political base, rather than healing the country.” Providence resident Leslie Pho, who is Asian, brought two friends: Elena Gressier, a white woman from Providence, and Andrea Maduro, who is Latina and from Pawtucket. “As an Asian person, I feel like it’s important to use my voice like this,” Pho said, holding her sign “Racism is the real pandemic.” “Not to be here would be an injustice. These are all my neighbors and my friends.” Advertisement Gressier, who held a “Black Lives Matter” sign, said it was her first protest. “I think with my white privilege I should be here, and my heart is broken over what’s going on,” she said. “I feel like this is history and it’s important to be here.” Nearly all wore face masks, though it was difficult to social distance and take precautions against the coronavirus in a rally. Jan Cawley, an infectious diseases nurse in Connecticut who has cared for patients with COVID-19, understands better than most about the virus. But after watching the video of Floyd dying, Cawley was horrified and wanted to be part of the rally. “There are things that are worth it,” Cawley said. “Getting a haircut: no. Protesting: yes.” Her sign made fun of “Karens,"" the term for white women who call the police unfairly on Black people. Cawley’s sign said: “Karens Against Systemic Racism. Hey officer, I want to see your manager.” For the most part, the Providence police and the Rhode Island State Police gave the rally space, standing away from protesters and stopping traffic as they marched. Earlier in the week, Providence Police Chief Hugh T. Clements Jr. and Public Safety Commissioner Steven M. Pare issued a statement condemning the actions of the Minneapolis police officers and offering their condolences to Floyd’s family and friends. Clements said he reached out to the leader of Black Lives Matter Rhode Island and discussed how to work with the rally. Advertisement The fury over Floyd’s death was having an impact on all of the officers, he said. “This incident, and the others, hurts all in our profession,” Clements said. As he spoke at the corner of Francis Street, facing the State House lawn, two young men on dirt bikes paused and stared at him and Pare, and other officers standing nearby. One of the men held up his hand, as if to wave at the police. Then, he cocked his fingers like a pistol and “shot"" himself in the head.

Protesters in Denmark also converged on the U.S. Embassy on Sunday. Participants carried placards with messages such as 'Stop Killing Black People.' The U.S. Embassy in Berlin was the scene of protests on Saturday under the motto: 'Justice for George Floyd.' Several hundred more people took to the streets Sunday in the capital's Kreuzberg area, carrying signs with slogans like 'Silence is Violence,' 'Hold Cops Accountable,' and 'Who Do You Call When Police Murder?' No incidents were reported. Germany's top-selling Bild newspaper on Sunday carried the sensational headline 'This killer-cop set America ablaze' with an arrow pointing to a photo of now-fired police officer Derek Chauvin, who has been charged with third-degree murder in Floyd's death, with his knee on Floyd's neck.

'There are exasperated black movements that no longer preach nonviolent resistance,' Gaggi wrote, noting the Minnesota governor's warning that 'anarchist and white supremacy groups are trying to fuel the chaos.'' In countries with authoritarian governments, state-controlled media have been highlighting the chaos and violence of the U.S. demonstrations, in part to undermine American officials' criticism of their own nations. In China, the protests are being viewed through the prism of U.S. government criticism of China's crackdown on anti-government protests in Hong Kong. Hu Xijin, the editor of the state-owned Global Times newspaper, tweeted that U.S. officials can now see protests out their own windows: 'I want to ask Speaker Pelosi and Secretary Pompeo: Should Beijing support protests in the U.S., like you glorified rioters in Hong Kong?' Hua Chunying, a Chinese Foreign ministry spokeswoman, pointed out America's racial unrest by tweeting 'I can't breathe,' which Floyd said before his death.

One TV anchor discussed 'a horrible scene from New York, where police attacked protesters.' Another state TV message accused U.S. police agencies in Washington of 'setting fire to cars and attacking protesters,' without offering any evidence. Russia accused the United States of 'systemic problems in the human rights sphere.'' It denounced Floyd's death as the latest in a series of police violence cases against African Americans.

The officer, Derek Chauvin, has been charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. Three other officers who were on scene at the time were fired from the Minneapolis Police Department but have yet to be charged. Protesters who gathered in Burnside Park on Saturday before marching to the State House said they felt angry and heartbroken over Floyd’s death and exhausted by the repeated killings of black people by police in America. The killings of Ahmaud Arbery, a 25-year-old unarmed black man who was shot while jogging in Glynn County, Georgia, and Breonna Taylor, a black woman who was shot while she was sleeping in her apartment in Louisville, Kentucky, have also sparked protests recently. “Year in and year out, nothing changes as far as the criminal justice system in this country,” said Shawn Holloway, 40, of Pawtucket, who held a “Black Lives Matter Rhode Island” sign over his head by the fountain in Burnside Park. “Black men and women are looked at as second-class citizens, and to this day we have to earn our right to be equal.” Protesters, most of whom wore face masks and carried signs, chanted, “No justice, no peace,” “Black lives matter,” and “I can’t breathe” in reference to Floyd, who repeatedly told the officer kneeling on his neck that he couldn’t breathe. The phrase became a rallying cry for the Black Lives Matter movement after Eric Garner, a black man killed by police in New York in 2014, said “I can’t breathe” as white officers held him in a chokehold. “We are tired,” said Matt Williams, 33, of North Providence. “We are tired of being disrespected. We are tired of being looked over. We are ready for change.” The novel coronavirus pandemic and the social-distancing measures put in place to help mitigate transmission of the virus didn’t deter protesters from gathering on Saturday. “I want to stay safe because of coronavirus, but at the same time, this is bigger than coronavirus,” said Williams, who wore a black bandanna over his nose and mouth. “This is something that’s been going on forever. ... I’m ready to stand for what I believe in and because of that, coronavirus or anything else, I’m going to be out here, front lines, standing for black people.” While protests in other cities have resulted in looting, rioting and violence in some cases, Saturday’s rally in Providence was peaceful. As she walked with other protesters from Burnside Park to the State House, Ridgshana Nonau, 21, of Providence, said that she is studying to become a detective so she can represent the black community within the criminal justice system. “I’m putting myself out there so I can be one of the good ones that can bring peace and can change everything that’s happening,” she said. Watching the video of Floyd’s killing, she said, brought her to tears. “Literally, my heart just broke,” she said. “I cried and I was speechless. ... I’m tired of it. This is not the first time.

(AP Photo/Ringo H.W. Chiu) The Latest on the death in Minneapolis of George Floyd, a handcuffed black man who pleaded for air as a white police officer pressed a knee on his neck: LOS ANGELES — Armed National Guard soldiers patrolled the streets of Los Angeles early Sunday as the city began cleaning up after a night of violence that saw demonstrators clash repeatedly with officers, torch police vehicles and pillage businesses. A rare citywide curfew expired as dawn revealed broken shop windows, demolished security gates and graffiti along entire blocks. Mayor Eric Garcetti said Saturday he asked Gov. Gavin Newsom for 500 to 700 members of the Guard to assist the 10,000 Los Angeles Police Department officers. Garcetti said the Guard members who arrived early Sunday were summoned “to support our local response to maintain peace and safety on the streets of our city.” LONDON — Thousands gathered in London’s Trafalgar Square to express their outrage over George Floyd’s death in Minnesota. Demonstrators clapped and waved placards as they offered support to U.S. demonstrators. The crowd gathered despite government rules barring crowds because of the COVID-19 pandemic. ATLANTA — Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp is expanding a state of emergency to authorize the deployment of up to 3,000 National Guard troops to protests in cities across the state. Kemp said he was prepared to send Guard soldiers to Athens, Savannah and any other Georgia cities where demonstrations were planned Sunday. “Hopefully we don’t have to,” the Republican governor told WSB-TV late Saturday. Kemp had already approved up to 1,500 Guardsmen to help enforce a 9 p.m. Saturday curfew in Atlanta. Atlanta police said in a statement late Saturday they had made more than 50 arrests as protesters threw rocks at officers and broke windows in the downtown area. The curfew was imposed after demonstrations Friday night turned violent with people setting fires and smashing windows at businesses and restaurants. “The protesters need to know we’re going to support their efforts in a peaceful, nonviolent protest,” Kemp said. “The agitators need to know that we’ll be there … to take them to jail if they’re destroying lives and property.” LA MESA, Calif. — The quaint downtown of suburban La Mesa near San Diego has suffered major damage with Chase and Union banks next door to each other burned to the ground. Windows were smashed at many businesses, including a Goodwill store, a Sotheby’s real estate office and a popular bar. San Diego police officers, aided by other law enforcement agencies, walked shoulder to shoulder through the streets after 2 a.m. Sunday, telling hundreds of protesters and observers that they would be arrested for unlawful assembly if they didn’t disperse.

Mike Parson activated the Missouri National Guard late Saturday. Earlier in the day, Ferguson Police Chief Jason Armstrong spoke to a group of about 500 peaceful protesters about how Michael Brown Jr.’s death was a “wake-up call to law enforcement.” The 18-year-old Brown, who was black, was shot and killed by a white Ferguson police officer in 2014, sparking a wave of protests throughout the country. RICHMOND, Va. — Photos on social media show several fires throughout downtown Richmond overnight as protests in the Virginia capital continued. The Richmond Times-Dispatch reports that the headquarters of the nearby United Daughters of the Confederacy burned early Sunday and was marked with graffiti. Several Confederate statues along the city’s Monument Avenue were defaced with graffiti. The newspaper reports that an apartment building on a downtown street also caught fire, but protesters initially wouldn’t let fire crews through until police cleared the area with tear gas. Protesters targeted police headquarters for the second night in a row as officers formed a barricade around the building. A dumpster was set afire near the police headquarters, which had its front windows broken out Friday night. The Richmond Times-Dispatch reported that the police fired tear gas to move crowds away from the building. Several blocks away near Virginia Commonwealth University hundreds of protesters blocked streets chanting “George Floyd,” referring to the black man who died Monday after an arresting officer in Minneapolis pushed his knee into Floyd’s neck while he was on the ground handcuffed.

PHOENIX — Protesters marched the streets of downtown Phoenix and Tucson Saturday after the cities’ leaders implored them to refrain from violence. The marches appeared to be largely peaceful, according to local media reports. On Saturday night, however, Phoenix police had to defend the department’s headquarters. Shortly after 10 p.m., Phoenix police said a large group of protesters downtown had become an unlawful assembly, the Arizona Republic reported. The police said they needed to disperse immediately. The protesters were seen kneeling with their hands up in the streets outside Phoenix police and municipal buildings, the Republic reported. They chanted, “Hands up, don’t shoot” and “Black lives matter.” San Francisco Mayor London Breed has declared a citywide curfew for Sunday night as violent protests rage throughout the city in the aftermath of George Floyd’s death.

A rare citywide curfew expired as dawn revealed broken shop windows, demolished security gates and graffiti along entire blocks. Mayor Eric Garcetti said Saturday he asked Gov. Gavin Newsom for 500 to 700 members of the Guard to assist the 10,000 Los Angeles Police Department officers. Garcetti said the Guard members who arrived early Sunday were summoned “to support our local response to maintain peace and safety on the streets of our city.” LONDON — Thousands gathered in London’s Trafalgar Square to express their outrage over George Floyd’s death in Minnesota. Demonstrators clapped and waved placards as they offered support to U.S. demonstrators. The crowd gathered despite government rules barring crowds because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

1621653508,2020-05-31 10:58:49,Black Lives Matter protesters rally at State House,https://www.newportri.com/news/20200531/black-lives-matter-protesters-rally-at-state-house?rssfeed=true,en,False,,662951,Newport Life,http://www.newportlifemagazine.com/,"The peaceful demonstration was held in the wake of the death of George Floyd, a black man who died while in police custody PROVIDENCE — A chorus of nearly 1,000 voices shouted George Floyd’s name from the State House lawn on Saturday in memory of the black man who died while being restrained by white police officers in Minneapolis this week, and in protest of police violence against black people across the country. “I’m tired of watching young black, brown, beautiful people dying,” said Gary Dantzler, an activist with Black Lives Matter Rhode Island, the group that organized Saturday’s rally. “White supremacy, we gotta end it.” Protests broke out in cities across the country this week after a video — showing a white officer kneeling on Floyd’s neck until his body went limp — spread across the internet. The officer, Derek Chauvin, has been charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. Three other officers who were on scene at the time were fired from the Minneapolis Police Department but have yet to be charged. Protesters who gathered in Burnside Park on Saturday before marching to the State House said they felt angry and heartbroken over Floyd’s death and exhausted by the repeated killings of black people by police in America. The killings of Ahmaud Arbery, a 25-year-old unarmed black man who was shot while jogging in Glynn County, Georgia, and Breonna Taylor, a black woman who was shot while she was sleeping in her apartment in Louisville, Kentucky, have also sparked protests recently. “Year in and year out, nothing changes as far as the criminal justice system in this country,” said Shawn Holloway, 40, of Pawtucket, who held a “Black Lives Matter Rhode Island” sign over his head by the fountain in Burnside Park. “Black men and women are looked at as second-class citizens, and to this day we have to earn our right to be equal.” Protesters, most of whom wore face masks and carried signs, chanted, “No justice, no peace,” “Black lives matter,” and “I can’t breathe” in reference to Floyd, who repeatedly told the officer kneeling on his neck that he couldn’t breathe. The phrase became a rallying cry for the Black Lives Matter movement after Eric Garner, a black man killed by police in New York in 2014, said “I can’t breathe” as white officers held him in a chokehold. “We are tired,” said Matt Williams, 33, of North Providence. “We are tired of being disrespected. We are tired of being looked over. We are ready for change.” The novel coronavirus pandemic and the social-distancing measures put in place to help mitigate transmission of the virus didn’t deter protesters from gathering on Saturday. “I want to stay safe because of coronavirus, but at the same time, this is bigger than coronavirus,” said Williams, who wore a black bandanna over his nose and mouth. “This is something that’s been going on forever. ... I’m ready to stand for what I believe in and because of that, coronavirus or anything else, I’m going to be out here, front lines, standing for black people.” While protests in other cities have resulted in looting, rioting and violence in some cases, Saturday’s rally in Providence was peaceful. As she walked with other protesters from Burnside Park to the State House, Ridgshana Nonau, 21, of Providence, said that she is studying to become a detective so she can represent the black community within the criminal justice system. “I’m putting myself out there so I can be one of the good ones that can bring peace and can change everything that’s happening,” she said. Watching the video of Floyd’s killing, she said, brought her to tears. “Literally, my heart just broke,” she said. “I cried and I was speechless. ... I’m tired of it. This is not the first time. And I want it to be the last time.”",0.0

City and state officials deployed thousands of National Guard soldiers, enacted strict curfews and shut down mass transit systems to slow protesters' movements, but that did little to stop parts of many cities from again erupting into mayhem. Protesters in Philadelphia hurled rocks and Molotov cocktails at police, officials said, while thieves in more than 20 California cities smashed their way into businesses and ran off with as much as they could carry "" boxes of sneakers, armloads of clothes, and cellphones, TVs and other electronics. In Minneapolis, a tanker truck driver drove into a massive crowd of demonstrators nearly a week after the death of George Floyd, a black man who pleaded for air as an officer pressed a knee into his neck. No protesters appeared to be injured, and the driver was arrested. Tensions spiked outside the White House, the scene of three days of demonstrations, where police fired tear gas and stun grenades into a crowd of more than 1,000 chanting protesters across the street in Lafayette Park. The crowd ran away and piled up road signs and plastic barriers to light a raging fire in a nearby street. Some pulled an American flag from a building and threw it into the blaze. A building in the park with bathrooms and a maintenance office went up in flames and people broke into banks and jewelry stores. As demonstrations persisted past curfew, Washington police said they were responding to multiple fires set around the capital. The entire Washington, D.C., National Guard "" roughly 1,700 soldiers "" was called in to help control the protests, according to two Defense Department officials who insisted on anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the matter. As the protests grew, President Donald Trump retweeted conservative commentator Buck Sexton who called for 'overwhelming force' against violent demonstrators. Secret Service agents had rushed Trump to a White House bunker on Friday night as hundreds of protesters gathered outside the executive mansion, some of them throwing rocks and tugging at police barricades. The president spent nearly an hour in the bunker designed for use in emergencies like terrorist attacks, according to a Republican close to the White House who was not authorized to publicly discuss private matters and spoke on condition of anonymity. The account was confirmed by an administration official who also spoke on condition of anonymity. Former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, visited the site of protests in his hometown of Wilmington, Delaware, and talked to some of the demonstrators. He also wrote a post on Medium expressing empathy for those despairing about the killing of George Floyd. At least 4,400 people have been arrested over days of protests, according to a tally compiled by The Associated Press. Arrests ranged from stealing and blocking highways to breaking curfew. In Salt Lake City, an activist leader condemned the destruction of property but said broken buildings shouldn't be mourned on the same level as black men like Floyd. 'Maybe this country will get the memo that we are sick of police murdering unarmed black men,' said Lex Scott, founder of Black Lives Matter Utah. 'Maybe the next time a white police officer decides to pull the trigger, he will picture cities burning.' Yet thousands still marched peacefully in Phoenix, Albuquerque and other cities, with some calling for an end to the fires, vandalism and theft, saying it weakened calls for justice and reform. 'They keep killing our people,' said Mahira Louis, 15, who marched with her mother and several hundred others in a peaceful protest through downtown Boston. 'I'm so sick and tired of it.' But as night fell that demonstration also descended into violence, with some protesters throwing rocks, bricks and glass bottles at officers and lighting a police vehicle on fire. In downtown Atlanta, authorities fired tear gas to disperse hundreds of demonstrators. Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said two officers had been fired and three placed on desk duty after video showed police surrounding a car Saturday, then pulling a woman out of the passenger seat and appearing to use a stun gun on a man who was driving. Police Chief Erika Shields called it 'really shocking to watch.' In downtown Los Angeles, a police SUV accelerated into several protesters in a street, knocking two people to the ground. The pair got up and ran onto the sidewalk. Nearby in Santa Monica, not far from a peaceful demonstration, a group broke into a Gap and a Vans sneaker store, where people walked out with boxes of shoes. Others shattered the windows of an REI outdoor supply store and snatched folding chairs, a bike and backpacks. A fire broke out at a restaurant across the street. About 30 miles (48 kilometers) south, as hundreds of protesters gathered in Long Beach, scores of thieves swarmed into nearby outlet stores. A steady stream emerged from a Forever 21 store carrying armloads of clothing. Some hauled it away in garbage bags, and a few stopped outside to change into stolen items. In Minneapolis, the officer who pressed his knee onto Floyd's neck has been charged with murder, but protesters are demanding the other three officers at the scene be prosecuted. All four were fired. 'We're not done,' said Darnella Wade, an organizer for Black Lives Matter in neighboring St. Paul, where thousands gathered peacefully in front of the state Capitol as state patrolmen and National Guard soldiers lined up in front of about a dozen military-style armored vehicles. ""They sent us the military, and we only asked them for arrests.' Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz brought in thousands of National Guard soldiers on Saturday to help quell violence that had damaged or destroyed hundreds of buildings in Minneapolis over days of protests. That appeared to help minimize unrest both Saturday and Sunday. Disgust over generations of racism in a country founded by slaveholders combined with a string of recent racially charged killings to stoke the anger. Adding to that was angst from months of lockdowns brought on by the coronavirus pandemic, which has disproportionately hurt communities of color, not only in terms of infections but in job losses and economic stress. The droves of people congregating for demonstrations threatened to trigger new outbreaks, a fact overshadowed by the boiling tensions. The scale of the coast-to-coast protests rivaled the historic demonstrations of the civil rights and Vietnam War eras.

Police Chief Erika Shields called it 'really shocking to watch.' In downtown Los Angeles, a police SUV accelerated into several protesters in a street, knocking two people to the ground. The pair got up and ran onto the sidewalk. Nearby in Santa Monica, not far from a peaceful demonstration, a group broke into a Gap and a Vans sneaker store, where people walked out with boxes of shoes. Others shattered the windows of an REI outdoor supply store and snatched folding chairs, a bike and backpacks. A fire broke out at a restaurant across the street. About 30 miles (48 kilometers) south, as hundreds of protesters gathered in Long Beach, scores of thieves swarmed into nearby outlet stores. A steady stream emerged from a Forever 21 store carrying armloads of clothing. Some hauled it away in garbage bags, and a few stopped outside to change into stolen items. In Minneapolis, the officer who pressed his knee onto Floyd's neck has been charged with murder, but protesters are demanding the other three officers at the scene be prosecuted. All four were fired. 'We're not done,' said Darnella Wade, an organizer for Black Lives Matter in neighboring St. Paul, where thousands gathered peacefully in front of the state Capitol as state patrolmen and National Guard soldiers lined up in front of about a dozen military-style armored vehicles. ""They sent us the military, and we only asked them for arrests.' Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz brought in thousands of National Guard soldiers on Saturday to help quell violence that had damaged or destroyed hundreds of buildings in Minneapolis over days of protests. That appeared to help minimize unrest both Saturday and Sunday. Disgust over generations of racism in a country founded by slaveholders combined with a string of recent racially charged killings to stoke the anger. Adding to that was angst from months of lockdowns brought on by the coronavirus pandemic, which has disproportionately hurt communities of color, not only in terms of infections but in job losses and economic stress. The droves of people congregating for demonstrations threatened to trigger new outbreaks, a fact overshadowed by the boiling tensions. The scale of the coast-to-coast protests rivaled the historic demonstrations of the civil rights and Vietnam War eras. Curfews were imposed in major cities around the U.S., including Atlanta, Chicago, Denver, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Seattle. About 5,000 National Guard soldiers and airmen were activated in 15 states and Washington, D.C. In Indianapolis, two people were reported dead in bursts of downtown violence this weekend, adding to deaths reported in Detroit and Minneapolis in recent days. In tweets Sunday, Trump blamed anarchists and the media for fueling violence. Attorney General William Barr pointed a finger at 'far left extremist' groups. Police chiefs and politicians accused outsiders of coming in and causing the problems. At the Minneapolis intersection where Floyd was killed, people gathered with brooms and flowers, saying it was important to protect what they called a 'sacred space.' Among in Minneapolis was Michael Brown Sr., the father of Michael Brown, whose killing by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, set off unrest in 2014. 'I understand what this family is feeling. I understand what this community is feeling,' he said. ___ Morrison and Sullivan reported from Minneapolis.

Meanwhile, experts who track extremist groups also reported seeing evidence of the far-right at work. Investigators were also tracking online interference and looking into whether foreign agents were behind the effort. Officials have seen a surge of social media accounts with fewer than 200 followers created in the last month, a textbook sign of a disinformation effort. The accounts have posted graphic images of the protests, material on police brutality and material on the coronavirus pandemic that appeared designed to inflame tensions across the political divide, according to three administration officials. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss investigations. The investigations are an attempt to identify the network of forces behind some of the most widespread outbreak of civil unrest in the U.S. in decades. Protests erupted in dozens of cities in recent days, triggered by the death of George Floyd, who died after he was pinned at the neck by a white Minneapolis police officer. Pandemic-weary Americans were already angry "" about COVID-19 deaths, lockdown orders and tens of millions of people out of work. The pandemic has hit African Americans harder than whites in the U.S., and the killings of black people by police have continued over the years even as the topic faded from the national stage. But there are signs of people with other disparate motives, including anarchist graffiti, arrests of some out-of-state protesters, and images circulating in extremist groups that suggest the involvement of outside groups. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said Sunday that state authorities were hit with a cyber attack as law enforcement prepared to diffuse protests in Minneapolis and St. Paul, the epicenter of the unrest. He described it as a 'very sophisticated denial of service attack on all computers.' President Donald Trump, Attorney General William Bar and others have said the left-wing extremist group antifa is to blame. Short for anti-fascists, antifa is an umbrella term for far-left-leaning militant groups that resist neo-Nazis and white supremacists at demonstrations. Barr on Sunday said the FBI would use its regional joint terrorism task forces to 'identify criminal organizers,' and Trump threatened again to name antifa a terrorist group. The Justice Department is also deploying members of the U.S. Marshals Service and agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration on Sunday to supplement National Guard troops outside the White House, a senior department official said. The official was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. The addition of the federal agents, who will have armored vehicles, came as Barr warned that prosecutors could seek to use terrorism statutes against 'violent radical agitators' who attempt to hijack protests to cause destruction. An antifa activist group disseminated a message in a Telegram channel on Saturday that encouraged people to consider Minnesota National Guard troops 'easy targets,' two Defense Department officials said. The message encouraged activists to steal 'kit,' meaning the weapons and body armor used by the soldiers. The officials were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. As a result, soldiers with the Minnesota National Guard were armed during their mission at protests across the state Sunday, the officials said. The soldiers are sometimes armed but had not been since they moved into parts of the state that had been besieged by riots in the last few days. The troops do not have the authority to make arrests, and are there to act mostly as extra security for police. Others have seen evidence of right-wing extremists. J.J. MacNab, a fellow at George Washington University's Program on Extremism, has been monitoring chatter about the protests among anti-government extremists on social media platforms. She has access to dozens of private Facebook groups for followers of the loosely organized 'Boogaloo' movement, which uses an '80s movie sequel as a code word for a second civil war. She also has been poring over images from the weekend protests and spotted some 'boogaloo bois' in the crowds, carrying high-powered rifles and wearing tactical gear. 'They want to co-opt them in order to start their war. They see themselves as being on the side of protesters and that the protesters themselves are useful in causing anarchy,' MacNab said. She also sees signs that the Three Percenters militia movement appears to be taking an interest. Megan Squire, an Elon University computer science professor who tracks online extremism, saw images of at least four members of the far-right Proud Boys group on the periphery of a protest Saturday night in Raleigh, North Carolina. Trump was expected in the coming days to draw distinctions between the legitimate anger of peaceful protesters and the unacceptable actions of violent agitators, said a White House official who was not authorized to discuss the plans ahead of time and spoke on condition of anonymity. The Trump administration has largely remained silent on local reports that far-right protesters were also involved.

A Minneapolis police station was torched and protests took off around the country, growing increasingly tense. Video showed a police vehicle ramming into demonstrators in New York. Meanwhile, a van with four New York Police Department officers inside was hit with a Molotov cocktail and torched. Hundreds have been arrested nationwide and cities braced for more protests. But booking information from the county jail in Minneapolis, for example, showed that out of 59 protest-related arrests, 47 people had a home address in Minnesota, with the majority coming from the Twin Cities.

The turbulence sparked by the death of George Floyd — a black man who died after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed a knee into his neck for several minutes — shook not only the streets of New York and Los Angeles, but dozens of smaller communities such as Fargo, North Dakota, and Lincoln, Nebraska. The damage extended even to buildings near the White House. ""They keep killing our people,"" said Mahira Louis, 15, who marched with her mother and several hundred others through downtown Boston on Sunday. ""I'm so sick and tired of it."" Peaceful protests involving tens of thousands of people on Saturday gave way, in some places, to violence, with police vehicles torched, stores emptied and objects hurled at officers. The police response varied from restrained to aggressive, with officers at times firing tear gas and rubber bullets. Police and peaceful protesters alike pleaded for a stop to violence, saying it weakened calls for justice and reform. ""It only hurts the cause,"" said Danielle Outlaw, head of the police force in Philadelphia, where more than 200 people were arrested as fires and looting engulfed the heart of the city. Disgust over generations of racism in a country founded by slaveholders combined with a string of recent racially charged killings to stoke the anger. Adding to that was angst from months of lockdowns brought on by the coronavirus pandemic, which has disproportionately hurt communities of color, not only in terms of infections but in job losses and economic stress. The droves of people congregating for demonstrations threatened to trigger new outbreaks, a fact overshadowed by the boiling tensions.

About 5,000 National Guard soldiers and airmen were activated in 15 states and Washington, D.C. In Minneapolis, police, state troopers and National Guard members showed new force Saturday in breaking up demonstrations after three days of police largely avoiding engaging protesters. Dozens of protests were underway or expected Sunday, from Miami to Kansas City to San Francisco. They went forth largely without incident, but sparks of crime continued. In Philadelphia, people robbed stores in broad daylight, and at least one more police vehicle was set ablaze. Streets leading downtown were closed. Chicago likewise restricted downtown access and called in the National Guard. At the Minneapolis intersection where Floyd was killed, people gathered with brooms and flowers, saying it was important to protect what they called a ""sacred space."" The intersection was blocked with the traffic cones while a ring of flowers was laid out. Among those descending on Minneapolis was Michael Brown Sr., the father of Michael Brown, whose killing by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, set off unrest in 2014. ""I understand what this family is feeling. I understand what this community is feeling,"" he said. County Commissioner Angela Conley said the demonstrations and confrontations with police would continue until the other three officers who were at the scene when Floyd was pinned down are arrested and prosecuted. The officer who held his knee on Floyd's neck, Derek Chauvin, was charged last week with murder. All four officers have been fired. ""We'll continue to have this militarized presence in our community until justice is done,"" Conley said. In tweets Sunday, President Donald Trump blamed anarchists and the media for fueling the violence. Attorney General William Barr pointed a finger at ""far left extremist"" groups.

Protesters set fires inside Reno's city hall, and police launched tear gas at rock-throwing demonstrators in Fargo, North Dakota. In Salt Lake City, demonstrators flipped a police car and lit it on fire. Police said six people were arrested and an officer was injured after being struck in the head with a baseball bat. By Sunday, the fury had spread to Europe, where thousands gathered in London's Trafalgar Square, clapping and waving placards despite government rules barring crowds because of the COVID-19 pandemic. In New York, a video Saturday showed two police cruisers lurching into a crowd of demonstrators who were pushing a barricade against one of them and pelting it with objects. Several people were knocked to the ground. It was unclear if anyone was hurt. ""The mistakes that are happening are not mistakes. They're repeated violent terrorist offenses, and people need to stop killing black people,"" Brooklyn protester Meryl Makielski said. In Indianapolis, two people were reported dead in bursts of downtown violence, adding to deaths reported in Detroit and Minneapolis in recent days.

Some of Floyd's gasped last words — ""I can't breathe"" — were repeated, alongside anti-police messages. Crews near the White House worked to replace windows that had been shattered with large pieces of wood. Buildings for blocks were marked with graffiti, including curses about Trump. Shattered glass still covered the sidewalks. The damaged buildings included the Department of Veterans Affairs, directly across the street from the White House.

This week's unrest recalled the riots in Los Angeles nearly 30 years ago after the acquittal of the white police officers who beat Rodney King, a black motorist who had led them on a high-speed chase. The protests of Floyd's killing have gripped many more cities, but the losses have yet to approach the staggering totals LA saw during five days of rioting in 1992, when more than 60 people died, 2,000-plus were injured and thousands arrested, with property damage topping $1 billion.",0.0

As demonstrations spread from Minneapolis to the White House, New York City and overseas, federal law enforcement officials insisted far-left groups were stoking violence. Meanwhile, experts who track extremist groups also reported seeing evidence of the far-right at work. Investigators were also tracking online interference and looking into whether foreign agents were behind the effort. Officials have seen a surge of social media accounts with fewer than 200 followers created in the last month, a textbook sign of a disinformation effort. The accounts have posted graphic images of the protests, material on police brutality and material on the coronavirus pandemic that appeared designed to inflame tensions across the political divide, according to three administration officials. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss investigations. The investigations are an attempt to identify the network of forces behind some of the most widespread outbreak of civil unrest in the U.S. in decades. Protests erupted in dozens of cities in recent days, triggered by the death of George Floyd, who died after he was pinned at the neck by a white Minneapolis police officer. Pandemic-weary Americans were already angry "" about COVID-19 deaths, lockdown orders and tens of millions of people out of work. The pandemic has hit African Americans harder than whites in the U.S., and the killings of black people by police have continued over the years even as the topic faded from the national stage. But there are signs of people with other disparate motives, including anarchist graffiti, arrests of some out-of-state protesters, and images circulating in extremist groups that suggest the involvement of outside groups. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said Sunday that state authorities were hit with a cyber attack as law enforcement prepared to diffuse protests in Minneapolis and St. Paul, the epicenter of the unrest. He described it as a 'very sophisticated denial of service attack on all computers.' President Donald Trump, Attorney General William Bar and others have said the left-wing extremist group antifa is to blame. Short for anti-fascists, antifa is an umbrella term for far-left-leaning militant groups that resist neo-Nazis and white supremacists at demonstrations. Barr on Sunday said the FBI would use its regional joint terrorism task forces to 'identify criminal organizers,' and Trump threatened again to name antifa a terrorist group. The Justice Department is also deploying members of the U.S. Marshals Service and agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration on Sunday to supplement National Guard troops outside the White House, a senior department official said. The official was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. The addition of the federal agents, who will have armored vehicles, came as Barr warned that prosecutors could seek to use terrorism statutes against 'violent radical agitators' who attempt to hijack protests to cause destruction. An antifa activist group disseminated a message in a Telegram channel on Saturday that encouraged people to consider Minnesota National Guard troops 'easy targets,' two Defense Department officials said. The message encouraged activists to steal 'kit,' meaning the weapons and body armor used by the soldiers. The officials were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. As a result, soldiers with the Minnesota National Guard were armed during their mission at protests across the state Sunday, the officials said. The soldiers are sometimes armed but had not been since they moved into parts of the state that had been besieged by riots in the last few days. The troops do not have the authority to make arrests, and are there to act mostly as extra security for police. Others have seen evidence of right-wing extremists. J.J. MacNab, a fellow at George Washington University's Program on Extremism, has been monitoring chatter about the protests among anti-government extremists on social media platforms. She has access to dozens of private Facebook groups for followers of the loosely organized 'Boogaloo' movement, which uses an '80s movie sequel as a code word for a second civil war. She also has been poring over images from the weekend protests and spotted some 'boogaloo bois' in the crowds, carrying high-powered rifles and wearing tactical gear. 'They want to co-opt them in order to start their war. They see themselves as being on the side of protesters and that the protesters themselves are useful in causing anarchy,' MacNab said. She also sees signs that the Three Percenters militia movement appears to be taking an interest. Megan Squire, an Elon University computer science professor who tracks online extremism, saw images of at least four members of the far-right Proud Boys group on the periphery of a protest Saturday night in Raleigh, North Carolina. Trump was expected in the coming days to draw distinctions between the legitimate anger of peaceful protesters and the unacceptable actions of violent agitators, said a White House official who was not authorized to discuss the plans ahead of time and spoke on condition of anonymity. The Trump administration has largely remained silent on local reports that far-right protesters were also involved. Meanwhile, Democratic mayors said Trump's handling of the crisis was reminiscent of one of the darkest moments of his presidency "" when he said there were 'good people on both sides' of protests in 2017 over white supremacists demonstrating in Charlottesville, Virginia. America's racial fault lines are a perfect opportunity for foreign adversaries looking to sow discord and portray the U.S. in a negative light, according to James Ludes, director of the Pell Center for International Relations and Public Policy at Salve Regina University in Rhode Island. 'This is a real issue and Americans are legitimately upset about it,' said Ludes, who studies foreign disinformation tactics. 'That's one of the hallmarks of these campaigns. You don't create new issues, you exploit existing issues.' There's a history of this. In 2016, another black man, Philando Castile, was killed by police in a Minneapolis suburb, his death livestreamed on Facebook. Russians used a fake Black Lives Matter page to confuse and stoke anger among the protesters. There were nearly 700,000 followers, but it's not clear how many were real. One debunked example from this week: That Atlanta had deployed a 'child militia."" Floyd was accused of trying to pass a bad bill at a grocery store after he was laid off in the pandemic. Disturbing video showed him prone on the street, while a white police officer pressed his knee into Floyd's neck even as he cried he couldn't breathe. He later died. The officers have been fired; Derek Chauvin, the officer who pinned Floyd in the video, was charged with murder. At first there were peaceful demonstrations, but violence soon erupted. A Minneapolis police station was torched and protests took off around the country, growing increasingly tense. Video showed a police vehicle ramming into demonstrators in New York. Meanwhile, a van with four New York Police Department officers inside was hit with a Molotov cocktail and torched. Hundreds have been arrested nationwide and cities braced for more protests. But booking information from the county jail in Minneapolis, for example, showed that out of 59 protest-related arrests, 47 people had a home address in Minnesota, with the majority coming from the Twin Cities. Before protests began in New York City, organizers of anarchist groups began raising money for bail, recruited medical teams to deploy for violent interactions with police and planned how to target high-end stores, said John Miller, the NYPD's deputy commissioner of intelligence and counterterrorism. Scouts on bicycles would also move ahead of the groups to report where the police would be and then direct small breakaway groups to areas where they could torch police cars or throw Molotov cocktails, Miller said. The NYPD has arrested 786 people related to protests since May 28 and 1 in 7 of them were not from New York City, he said. In Washington, where protesters raged outside the White House, most of the 17 people arrested were from the area. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser said the groups seemed, at the least, organized to destroy with tools to break windows and distribute materials. ___ Associated Press writers Kathleen Hennessey in Minneapolis; Michael Kunzelman in Silver Spring, Md.; Michael R.

Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said at a news conference that she and police Chief Erika Shields made the decision after reviewing body-camera footage of a Saturday night incident that first gained attention from video online and on local news. 'Use of excessive force is never acceptable,"" Bottoms told reporters. Shields called the footage 'really shocking to watch.' Police on Sunday night identified the fired officers as Investigator Ivory Streeter, who was hired in December 2003, and Investigator Mark Gardner, who was hired in August 1997. The video, shown on TV as captured by local reporters, shows a group of police officers in riot gear and gas masks surround a car being driven by a man with a woman in the passenger seat. The officers appear to fire a stun gun at the woman and then pull her from the car. They then use a stun gun on the man. They use zip-tie handcuffs on the woman on the ground. The couple did not appear to be fighting police. TV reporters said the police had earlier broken glass on the car and flattened the tires. Bottoms said the woman, Taniyah Pilgrim, was released without charges. She said the man, Messiah Young, was released, too, and she's ordering the charges against him dropped. She didn't specify what charges he faced. A police report says Young was charged with attempting to elude police and driving with a suspended license. The mayor said she'd delayed the news conference several hours to review all the body-camera footage because she and Shields wanted to be certain about what happened. 'I really wanted to believe that the body-worn camera footage would provide some larger view that could better rationalize why we got to this space,' Shields said. 'And having spent most of the afternoon with the mayor, reviewing the footage exhaustively, I knew that I had only one option, and that is to terminate the employees.' Bottoms said she had spoken to leaders at Spelman College and Morehouse College, where she said the the young people were students. She said she'd also spoken to representatives for the students but hadn't yet spoken directly to them. Shields offered an apology and said she knows the officers' behavior was unacceptable and caused further fear. 'Sometimes the best thing, the only thing you can do as a police chief is come in and clean up the mess that's before you,' Shields said. 'When wrong is wrong, we have to, as law enforcement, start dealing with it in the same manner that we would deal with it with non-law enforcement,"" Shields said. ""For some reason, we've fallen into a gray area where there's a separate set of rules for law enforcement, and if we want to get out of this space that we're in now we have to change how we manage internally.' Shields said she experienced a broad range of emotions as just a few hours before she saw the video, another of her officers was seriously injured. A preliminary investigation indicates the officer was in an intersection on foot to block traffic from passing into an area where there were protesters when a person on an ATV approached at a high rate of speed and hit him. Officer Maximilian Brewer suffered significant injuries to his legs and remained in the intensive care unit Sunday evening, Shields said, adding that she hopes he'll be able to walk again. The ATV rider was taken into custody at the scene and to a hospital with non-life-threatening injuries. Police on Sunday night identified the driver of the ATV as 42-year-old Avery Goggans. He has been charged with DUI, serious injury by vehicle, reckless driving, possession of marijuana and several other traffic charges, police Sgt. John Chafee said in an email. Bottoms imposed a 9 p.m. curfew for Saturday and Sunday. Gov. Brian Kemp authorized up to 3,000 National Guard troops to be deployed in cities across the state to respond if needed to protests over the deaths of George Floyd in Minnesota and Ahmaud Arbery in coastal Georgia. Atlanta police said Sunday they had arrested more than 150 people as protesters threw rocks at officers and broke windows in the downtown area. The curfew was initially imposed after demonstrations Friday night turned violent with people setting fires and smashing windows at businesses and restaurants.",0.0

Camden County Police Chief Joe Wysocki, who has been working in the city for decades, joined the front line of a march in Camden on Saturday afternoon, sporting his uniform, a protective face mask and a peace sign. 'Yesterday was another example of our ongoing engagement, and a very real dialogue, that we are having with residents throughout Camden that has made our agency part of the fabric of this city,"" Wysocki said in an emailed statement to The Associated Press. Since Camden's police force disbanded and reformed in 2013 as a county agency, officers there have been hyper-focused on community policing. It's not strange to see them on walking beats or attending neighborhood block parties like the one Saturday night where two officers grilled up hamburgers and hot dogs. 'We know that together we are stronger, we know that together, in the city of Camden, we can create a space where policing is focused on deescalation and dialogue,"" Wysocki said. Protests have been held for days in cities all over the United States in response to Floyd's death. Floyd, who was black, died Monday after a white police officer pressed his knee on his neck until he stopped breathing. On Saturday night, peaceful protests turned violent in cities like New York, Philadelphia, Los Angeles and Atlanta. Store windows were smashed and items were stolen, police cars were set on fire. Both police officers and civilians suffered serious injuries. There were other instances of police solidarity throughout the U.S. widely shared on social media.

The turbulence sparked by the death of George Floyd — a black man who died after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed a knee into his neck for several minutes — shook not only the streets of New York and Los Angeles, but dozens of smaller communities such as Fargo, North Dakota, and Lincoln, Nebraska. The damage extended even to buildings near the White House. ""They keep killing our people,"" said Mahira Louis, 15, who marched with her mother and several hundred others through downtown Boston on Sunday. ""I'm so sick and tired of it."" Peaceful protests involving tens of thousands of people on Saturday gave way, in some places, to violence, with police vehicles torched, stores emptied and objects hurled at officers. The police response varied from restrained to aggressive, with officers at times firing tear gas and rubber bullets. Police and peaceful protesters alike pleaded for a stop to violence, saying it weakened calls for justice and reform. ""It only hurts the cause,"" said Danielle Outlaw, head of the police force in Philadelphia, where more than 200 people were arrested as fires and looting engulfed the heart of the city. Disgust over generations of racism in a country founded by slaveholders combined with a string of recent racially charged killings to stoke the anger. Adding to that was angst from months of lockdowns brought on by the coronavirus pandemic, which has disproportionately hurt communities of color, not only in terms of infections but in job losses and economic stress. The droves of people congregating for demonstrations threatened to trigger new outbreaks, a fact overshadowed by the boiling tensions. ""Maybe this country will get the memo that we are sick of police murdering unarmed black men,"" said Lex Scott, founder of Black Lives Matter Utah. ""Maybe the next time a white police officer decides to pull the trigger, he will picture cities burning."" The scale of the protests, sweeping from coast to coast and unfolding on a single night, rivaled the historic demonstrations of the civil rights and Vietnam War eras. Curfews were imposed in major cities around the U.S., including Atlanta, Chicago, Denver, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Seattle. About 5,000 National Guard soldiers and airmen were activated in 15 states and Washington, D.C. In Minneapolis, police, state troopers and National Guard members showed new force Saturday in breaking up demonstrations after three days of police largely avoiding engaging protesters. Dozens of protests were underway or expected Sunday, from Miami to Kansas City to San Francisco. They went forth largely without incident, but sparks of crime continued. In Philadelphia, people robbed stores in broad daylight, and at least one more police vehicle was set ablaze. Streets leading downtown were closed. Chicago likewise restricted downtown access and called in the National Guard. At the Minneapolis intersection where Floyd was killed, people gathered with brooms and flowers, saying it was important to protect what they called a ""sacred space."" The intersection was blocked with the traffic cones while a ring of flowers was laid out. Among those descending on Minneapolis was Michael Brown Sr., the father of Michael Brown, whose killing by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, set off unrest in 2014. ""I understand what this family is feeling. I understand what this community is feeling,"" he said. County Commissioner Angela Conley said the demonstrations and confrontations with police would continue until the other three officers who were at the scene when Floyd was pinned down are arrested and prosecuted. The officer who held his knee on Floyd's neck, Derek Chauvin, was charged last week with murder. All four officers have been fired. ""We'll continue to have this militarized presence in our community until justice is done,"" Conley said. In tweets Sunday, President Donald Trump blamed anarchists and the media for fueling the violence. Attorney General William Barr pointed a finger at ""far left extremist"" groups. Police chiefs and politicians accused outsiders of coming in and causing the problems. Few parts of America were untouched. Protesters set fires inside Reno's city hall, and police launched tear gas at rock-throwing demonstrators in Fargo, North Dakota. In Salt Lake City, demonstrators flipped a police car and lit it on fire. Police said six people were arrested and an officer was injured after being struck in the head with a baseball bat. By Sunday, the fury had spread to Europe, where thousands gathered in London's Trafalgar Square, clapping and waving placards despite government rules barring crowds because of the COVID-19 pandemic. In New York, a video Saturday showed two police cruisers lurching into a crowd of demonstrators who were pushing a barricade against one of them and pelting it with objects. Several people were knocked to the ground. It was unclear if anyone was hurt. ""The mistakes that are happening are not mistakes. They're repeated violent terrorist offenses, and people need to stop killing black people,"" Brooklyn protester Meryl Makielski said. In Indianapolis, two people were reported dead in bursts of downtown violence, adding to deaths reported in Detroit and Minneapolis in recent days. Buildings around the U.S. were defaced with spray-painted messages, from the facade of St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York to the historic Hay-Adams hotel near the White House. Some of Floyd's gasped last words — ""I can't breathe"" — were repeated, alongside anti-police messages. Crews near the White House worked to replace windows that had been shattered with large pieces of wood. Buildings for blocks were marked with graffiti, including curses about Trump. Shattered glass still covered the sidewalks. The damaged buildings included the Department of Veterans Affairs, directly across the street from the White House. Some leaders prepared to put more soldiers in the streets. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp authorized the deployment of up to 3,000 National Guard troops to Athens, Savannah and any other cities where more demonstrations were planned. Kemp had already approved up to 1,500 Guardsmen to help enforce a 9 p.m. Saturday curfew in Atlanta. This week's unrest recalled the riots in Los Angeles nearly 30 years ago after the acquittal of the white police officers who beat Rodney King, a black motorist who had led them on a high-speed chase. The protests of Floyd's killing have gripped many more cities, but the losses have yet to approach the staggering totals LA saw during five days of rioting in 1992, when more than 60 people died, 2,000-plus were injured and thousands arrested, with property damage topping $1 billion.",0.0

Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said at a news conference that she and police Chief Erika Shields made the decision after reviewing body-camera footage of a Saturday night incident that first gained attention from video online and on local news. 'Use of excessive force is never acceptable,"" Bottoms told reporters. Shields called the footage 'really shocking to watch.' Police on Sunday night identified the fired officers as Investigator Ivory Streeter, who was hired in December 2003, and Investigator Mark Gardner, who was hired in August 1997. The video, shown on TV as captured by local reporters, shows a group of police officers in riot gear and gas masks surround a car being driven by a man with a woman in the passenger seat. The officers appear to fire a stun gun at the woman and then pull her from the car. They then use a stun gun on the man. They use zip-tie handcuffs on the woman on the ground. The couple did not appear to be fighting police. TV reporters said the police had earlier broken glass on the car and flattened the tires. Bottoms said the woman, Taniyah Pilgrim, was released without charges. She said the man, Messiah Young, was released, too, and she's ordering the charges against him dropped. She didn't specify what charges he faced. A police report says Young was charged with attempting to elude police and driving with a suspended license. The mayor said she'd delayed the news conference several hours to review all the body-camera footage because she and Shields wanted to be certain about what happened. 'I really wanted to believe that the body-worn camera footage would provide some larger view that could better rationalize why we got to this space,' Shields said. 'And having spent most of the afternoon with the mayor, reviewing the footage exhaustively, I knew that I had only one option, and that is to terminate the employees.' Bottoms said she had spoken to leaders at Spelman College and Morehouse College, where she said the the young people were students. She said she'd also spoken to representatives for the students but hadn't yet spoken directly to them. Shields offered an apology and said she knows the officers' behavior was unacceptable and caused further fear. 'Sometimes the best thing, the only thing you can do as a police chief is come in and clean up the mess that's before you,' Shields said. 'When wrong is wrong, we have to, as law enforcement, start dealing with it in the same manner that we would deal with it with non-law enforcement,"" Shields said. ""For some reason, we've fallen into a gray area where there's a separate set of rules for law enforcement, and if we want to get out of this space that we're in now we have to change how we manage internally.' Shields said she experienced a broad range of emotions as just a few hours before she saw the video, another of her officers was seriously injured. A preliminary investigation indicates the officer was in an intersection on foot to block traffic from passing into an area where there were protesters when a person on an ATV approached at a high rate of speed and hit him. Officer Maximilian Brewer suffered significant injuries to his legs and remained in the intensive care unit Sunday evening, Shields said, adding that she hopes he'll be able to walk again. The ATV rider was taken into custody at the scene and to a hospital with non-life-threatening injuries. Police on Sunday night identified the driver of the ATV as 42-year-old Avery Goggans. He has been charged with DUI, serious injury by vehicle, reckless driving, possession of marijuana and several other traffic charges, police Sgt. John Chafee said in an email. Bottoms imposed a 9 p.m. curfew for Saturday and Sunday. Gov. Brian Kemp authorized up to 3,000 National Guard troops to be deployed in cities across the state to respond if needed to protests over the deaths of George Floyd in Minnesota and Ahmaud Arbery in coastal Georgia.

'Yesterday was another example of our ongoing engagement, and a very real dialogue, that we are having with residents throughout Camden that has made our agency part of the fabric of this city,"" Wysocki said in an emailed statement to The Associated Press.

In more than 20 cities, thieves smashed their way into businesses and ran off with as much as they could carry "" boxes of sneakers, armloads of clothes and cellphones and TVs. Nearly 400 people were arrested in Los Angeles from unrest Saturday as protests have become increasingly violent over several nights because of outrage over the Minneapolis police killing of George Floyd, Police Chief Michel Moore said. Moore said he hoped the National Guard and additional officers deployed would help. But before the sun set, there was brazen looting in Santa Monica and Long Beach even while nearby protests were mostly peaceful. Violence statewide include an arm wound suffered by a gunshot victim in Walnut Creek. Across the state, devastated shop owners cleaned up. In Emeryville, across the bay from San Francisco, where thieves stormed malls late Saturday, Keyla Calderon swept up glass outside the medical scrubs shop Uniform Advantage. Calderon's store had just reopened after being shuttered for six weeks under California's orders to stem spread of the coronavirus. She said she had just returned home Saturday when she learned the burglar alarm was triggered. She turned on the news to see scenes of people breaking into her shop and others. 'To hear the alarm ring and see people destroy the store before my eyes, it was heartbreaking,' Calderon said. ""We're all working hard to feed our family. We have nothing to do with these injustices, yet we're paying the consequences.' Gov. Gavin Newsom deployed 1,000 members of the Guard to assist the 20,000 officers of the Los Angeles police and sheriff's departments, Mayor Eric Garcetti said. The San Francisco police chief said about 200 outside officers were en route. Humvees lined up outside Los Angeles City Hall, and troops stood behind police on the steps of the building as protesters gathered despite a curfew. Unrest in Santa Monica happened not far from a peaceful demonstration near the city's famous pier as looters targeted shops near the popular Third Street Promenade. They broke into a Gap store and a Vans sneaker store, walking out with boxes with no police in sight. A woman holding a sign saying 'End All Violence' tried to block a man with a hammer from smashing the door of an REI store. The man yanked her from the door. She returned to the doorway and another protester joined her and the vandals eventually moved on. But others later made off with merchandise. As protesters gathered in Long Beach, thieves swarmed nearby stores at The Pike Outlets. A Forever 21 store was a favored target, and a steady stream emerged carrying armloads of clothing. Some stopped to change into stolen items. A bizarre scene unfolded about a half-mile away when people stealing from a clothing store became trapped inside as police gathered outside the mostly boarded-up store front. A woman screamed inside and then a man kicked his way out a window above the plywood and dropped to the sidewalk. He was followed by more than a half-dozen others, with one man throwing out an armload of clothes and then gathering them up and running off as police nearby didn't attempt to make arrests. About 1,000 people marched through the streets of San Francisco, carrying signs and chanting 'George Floyd,' 'Black Lives Matter.' 'We're here because George Floyd was murdered in cold blood,"" Aliasiah Allah said. In San Diego, a protest took an ominous turn after several hours when police said they fired tear gas to disperse a crowd pelting them with rocks and bottles. In Los Angeles, damage from Saturday's violence included windows shattered at nearly every shop along a stretch of trendy Melrose Avenue. Alan Kokozian looked up through a hole in the roof of Tony K's Shoe Store, where fire had burned and most of his inventory was stolen or damaged. He had pleaded for people to spare his establishment and was struck in the head with a bottle. 'This was not a political protest,' Kokozian said. Officials acknowledged the anger of protesters over the death of Floyd, a handcuffed black man who died after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee to Floyd's neck, and affirmed their right to demonstrate. But they condemned the wave of crime by a small number that had overshadowed the protest message. 'It breaks my heart, too, to think about the Angelenos protesting in peace and fighting for justice how this violence and looting clouds that picture,"" Garcetti said. Yet it was hard to ignore images of police cars engulfed in flames in Los Angeles, people running out the broken door of an Alexander McQueen luxury clothing store on Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills or demonstrators tossing fireworks at officers in Santa Ana. There was also video of officers in skirmish lines in LA, some swinging clubs at protesters, others firing projectiles at people with their hands up and crowds running from a cloud of tear gas in Beverly Hills. Garcetti praised the 99.99% of officers he said had shown restraint. Moore, who was on the front lines Saturday, said officers had acted appropriately, though he acknowledged some 'individual failures.' Five LAPD officers were injured in the clashes and two hospitalized, including one who required surgery after his skull was fractured by a brick, Moore said. San Francisco's popular Union Square saw people stealing leather bags from the Coach store and shoes from the Salvatore Ferragamo location, The Mercury News reported. Streets were littered with bras from Victoria's Secret and cushioned jewelry boxes from Swarovski. Mayor London Breed said the city's 8 p.m. curfew would be extended indefinitely. Breed expressed sadness about the destruction and said she was not going to tolerate the violence. 'I was extremely upset because unfortunately with some of the vandals, they thought this was a game, they thought this was funny,"" Breed said. Protests also roiled the east San Diego suburb of La Mesa, where two adjacent banks burned to the ground. 'I think people are hurting and they're angry and they're trying to be heard because there's no other way to get anyone's attention,' Ally Kaiahua said of the property damage in La Mesa. ___ Nguyen reported from Emeryville.

Shields said she experienced a broad range of emotions as just a few hours before she saw the video, another of her officers was seriously injured. A preliminary investigation indicates the officer was in an intersection on foot to block traffic from passing into an area where there were protesters when a person on an ATV approached at a high rate of speed and hit him. Officer Maximilian Brewer suffered significant injuries to his legs and remained in the intensive care unit Sunday evening, Shields said, adding that she hopes he'll be able to walk again. The ATV rider was taken into custody at the scene and to a hospital with non-life-threatening injuries. Police on Sunday night identified the driver of the ATV as 42-year-old Avery Goggans. He has been charged with DUI, serious injury by vehicle, reckless driving, possession of marijuana and several other traffic charges, police Sgt. John Chafee said in an email. Bottoms imposed a 9 p.m. curfew for Saturday and Sunday. Gov. Brian Kemp authorized up to 3,000 National Guard troops to be deployed in cities across the state to respond if needed to protests over the deaths of George Floyd in Minnesota and Ahmaud Arbery in coastal Georgia. Atlanta police said Sunday they had arrested more than 150 people as protesters threw rocks at officers and broke windows in the downtown area. The curfew was initially imposed after demonstrations Friday night turned violent with people setting fires and smashing windows at businesses and restaurants.",0.0

In more than 20 cities, thieves smashed their way into businesses and ran off with as much as they could carry "" boxes of sneakers, armloads of clothes and cellphones and TVs. Nearly 400 people were arrested in Los Angeles from unrest Saturday as protests have become increasingly violent over several nights because of outrage over the Minneapolis police killing of George Floyd, Police Chief Michel Moore said. Moore said he hoped the National Guard and additional officers deployed would help. But before the sun set, there was brazen looting in Santa Monica and Long Beach even while nearby protests were mostly peaceful. Violence statewide include an arm wound suffered by a gunshot victim in Walnut Creek. Across the state, devastated shop owners cleaned up. In Emeryville, across the bay from San Francisco, where thieves stormed malls late Saturday, Keyla Calderon swept up glass outside the medical scrubs shop Uniform Advantage. Calderon's store had just reopened after being shuttered for six weeks under California's orders to stem spread of the coronavirus. She said she had just returned home Saturday when she learned the burglar alarm was triggered. She turned on the news to see scenes of people breaking into her shop and others. 'To hear the alarm ring and see people destroy the store before my eyes, it was heartbreaking,' Calderon said. ""We're all working hard to feed our family. We have nothing to do with these injustices, yet we're paying the consequences.' Gov. Gavin Newsom deployed 1,000 members of the Guard to assist the 20,000 officers of the Los Angeles police and sheriff's departments, Mayor Eric Garcetti said. The San Francisco police chief said about 200 outside officers were en route. Humvees lined up outside Los Angeles City Hall, and troops stood behind police on the steps of the building as protesters gathered despite a curfew. Unrest in Santa Monica happened not far from a peaceful demonstration near the city's famous pier as looters targeted shops near the popular Third Street Promenade. They broke into a Gap store and a Vans sneaker store, walking out with boxes with no police in sight. A woman holding a sign saying 'End All Violence' tried to block a man with a hammer from smashing the door of an REI store. The man yanked her from the door. She returned to the doorway and another protester joined her and the vandals eventually moved on. But others later made off with merchandise. As protesters gathered in Long Beach, thieves swarmed nearby stores at The Pike Outlets. A Forever 21 store was a favored target, and a steady stream emerged carrying armloads of clothing. Some stopped to change into stolen items. A bizarre scene unfolded about a half-mile away when people stealing from a clothing store became trapped inside as police gathered outside the mostly boarded-up store front. A woman screamed inside and then a man kicked his way out a window above the plywood and dropped to the sidewalk. He was followed by more than a half-dozen others, with one man throwing out an armload of clothes and then gathering them up and running off as police nearby didn't attempt to make arrests. About 1,000 people marched through the streets of San Francisco, carrying signs and chanting 'George Floyd,' 'Black Lives Matter.' 'We're here because George Floyd was murdered in cold blood,"" Aliasiah Allah said. In San Diego, a protest took an ominous turn after several hours when police said they fired tear gas to disperse a crowd pelting them with rocks and bottles. In Los Angeles, damage from Saturday's violence included windows shattered at nearly every shop along a stretch of trendy Melrose Avenue. Alan Kokozian looked up through a hole in the roof of Tony K's Shoe Store, where fire had burned and most of his inventory was stolen or damaged. He had pleaded for people to spare his establishment and was struck in the head with a bottle. 'This was not a political protest,' Kokozian said. Officials acknowledged the anger of protesters over the death of Floyd, a handcuffed black man who died after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee to Floyd's neck, and affirmed their right to demonstrate. But they condemned the wave of crime by a small number that had overshadowed the protest message. 'It breaks my heart, too, to think about the Angelenos protesting in peace and fighting for justice how this violence and looting clouds that picture,"" Garcetti said. Yet it was hard to ignore images of police cars engulfed in flames in Los Angeles, people running out the broken door of an Alexander McQueen luxury clothing store on Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills or demonstrators tossing fireworks at officers in Santa Ana. There was also video of officers in skirmish lines in LA, some swinging clubs at protesters, others firing projectiles at people with their hands up and crowds running from a cloud of tear gas in Beverly Hills. Garcetti praised the 99.99% of officers he said had shown restraint. Moore, who was on the front lines Saturday, said officers had acted appropriately, though he acknowledged some 'individual failures.' Five LAPD officers were injured in the clashes and two hospitalized, including one who required surgery after his skull was fractured by a brick, Moore said. San Francisco's popular Union Square saw people stealing leather bags from the Coach store and shoes from the Salvatore Ferragamo location, The Mercury News reported. Streets were littered with bras from Victoria's Secret and cushioned jewelry boxes from Swarovski. Mayor London Breed said the city's 8 p.m. curfew would be extended indefinitely. Breed expressed sadness about the destruction and said she was not going to tolerate the violence. 'I was extremely upset because unfortunately with some of the vandals, they thought this was a game, they thought this was funny,"" Breed said. Protests also roiled the east San Diego suburb of La Mesa, where two adjacent banks burned to the ground. 'I think people are hurting and they're angry and they're trying to be heard because there's no other way to get anyone's attention,' Ally Kaiahua said of the property damage in La Mesa. ___ Nguyen reported from Emeryville.

Camden County Police Chief Joe Wysocki, who has been working in the city for decades, joined the front line of a march in Camden on Saturday afternoon, sporting his uniform, a protective face mask and a peace sign. 'Yesterday was another example of our ongoing engagement, and a very real dialogue, that we are having with residents throughout Camden that has made our agency part of the fabric of this city,"" Wysocki said in an emailed statement to The Associated Press. Since Camden's police force disbanded and reformed in 2013 as a county agency, officers there have been hyper-focused on community policing. It's not strange to see them on walking beats or attending neighborhood block parties like the one Saturday night where two officers grilled up hamburgers and hot dogs. 'We know that together we are stronger, we know that together, in the city of Camden, we can create a space where policing is focused on deescalation and dialogue,"" Wysocki said. Protests have been held for days in cities all over the United States in response to Floyd's death. Floyd, who was black, died Monday after a white police officer pressed his knee on his neck until he stopped breathing. On Saturday night, peaceful protests turned violent in cities like New York, Philadelphia, Los Angeles and Atlanta. Store windows were smashed and items were stolen, police cars were set on fire. Both police officers and civilians suffered serious injuries. There were other instances of police solidarity throughout the U.S. widely shared on social media. Marchers in Flint Township, Michigan, arrived at a police station where Genesee County Sheriff Christopher Swanson "" responding to chants of 'Walk with us! Walk with us!"" "" said, 'Come on!' and joined the protest. Police in Fargo, North Dakota, held hands with protesters while officers took a knee in Santa Cruz, California. While Sunday afternoon in New York, officers clapped on protesters, hundreds of whom stopped and took a knee with fists raised just north of the Empire State Building. ___ This story has been corrected to show that the Genesee County sheriff marched with protesters in Flint Township, not Flint.",0.0

Earlier, he wrote a post on Medium expressing empathy for those despairing about the killing of George Floyd. That low-key, high-touch approach may be a sign of how the presumptive Democratic nominee presents himself in the five months before the presidential election, emphasizing calm and competence as a contrast to a mercurial president. It is an approach that carries the risk of being drowned out by the much louder, more persistent voice of Trump. On one of the most profound weekends the nation has seen, with violence in dozens of cities, Biden was out of wide public view. 'He's not in office, and he certainly does not have the megaphone like the person currently occupying the White House does, but I do think our people are looking for someone who can make them feel better during these extremely tough times,' said Rep. Val Demings of Florida, whom Biden is considering as a running mate. 'America just needs to be reassured that there's someone who's understanding, someone who's willing to say, 'Yes, we do have some issues,' and someone who's willing to address it.'

Demings said she has also offered to have discussions with the Biden campaign on criminal justice reforms. She's pushed for a major Justice Department review of law enforcement agencies throughout the country, and said she saw a role for the federal government in implementing standard policies that govern hiring, training, retention and pay and benefits for law enforcement officers. 'What I have done is offer my service to the campaign and, and anyone else, to look at what we can do working together moving forward. And so we'll see. We have a lot of work to do,' she said. 'We're going to discuss ideas and make recommendations.' Biden released a criminal justice reform plan last July, but has not issued an updated or more specific proposal since then. In early May, he released his 'Plan for Black America,' an economic- and education-focused agenda that included marijuana decriminalization.

City and state officials deployed thousands of National Guard soldiers, enacted strict curfews and shut down mass transit systems to slow protesters' movements, but that did little to stop parts of many cities from again erupting into mayhem. Protesters in Philadelphia hurled rocks and Molotov cocktails at police, officials said, while thieves in more than 20 California cities smashed their way into businesses and ran off with as much as they could carry "" boxes of sneakers, armloads of clothes, and cellphones, TVs and other electronics. In Minneapolis, a tanker truck driver drove into a massive crowd of demonstrators nearly a week after the death of George Floyd, a black man who pleaded for air as an officer pressed a knee into his neck. No protesters appeared to be injured, and the driver was arrested. Tensions spiked outside the White House, the scene of three days of demonstrations, where police fired tear gas and stun grenades into a crowd of more than 1,000 chanting protesters across the street in Lafayette Park. The crowd ran away and piled up road signs and plastic barriers to light a raging fire in a nearby street. Some pulled an American flag from a building and threw it into the blaze. A building in the park with bathrooms and a maintenance office went up in flames and people broke into banks and jewelry stores. As demonstrations persisted past curfew, Washington police said they were responding to multiple fires set around the capital. The entire Washington, D.C., National Guard "" roughly 1,700 soldiers "" was called in to help control the protests, according to two Defense Department officials who insisted on anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the matter. As the protests grew, President Donald Trump retweeted conservative commentator Buck Sexton who called for 'overwhelming force' against violent demonstrators. Secret Service agents had rushed Trump to a White House bunker on Friday night as hundreds of protesters gathered outside the executive mansion, some of them throwing rocks and tugging at police barricades. The president spent nearly an hour in the bunker designed for use in emergencies like terrorist attacks, according to a Republican close to the White House who was not authorized to publicly discuss private matters and spoke on condition of anonymity. The account was confirmed by an administration official who also spoke on condition of anonymity. Former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, visited the site of protests in his hometown of Wilmington, Delaware, and talked to some of the demonstrators. He also wrote a post on Medium expressing empathy for those despairing about the killing of George Floyd. At least 4,400 people have been arrested over days of protests, according to a tally compiled by The Associated Press. Arrests ranged from stealing and blocking highways to breaking curfew. In Salt Lake City, an activist leader condemned the destruction of property but said broken buildings shouldn't be mourned on the same level as black men like Floyd. 'Maybe this country will get the memo that we are sick of police murdering unarmed black men,' said Lex Scott, founder of Black Lives Matter Utah. 'Maybe the next time a white police officer decides to pull the trigger, he will picture cities burning.' Yet thousands still marched peacefully in Phoenix, Albuquerque and other cities, with some calling for an end to the fires, vandalism and theft, saying it weakened calls for justice and reform. 'They keep killing our people,' said Mahira Louis, 15, who marched with her mother and several hundred others in a peaceful protest through downtown Boston. 'I'm so sick and tired of it.' But as night fell that demonstration also descended into violence, with some protesters throwing rocks, bricks and glass bottles at officers and lighting a police vehicle on fire. In downtown Atlanta, authorities fired tear gas to disperse hundreds of demonstrators. Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said two officers had been fired and three placed on desk duty after video showed police surrounding a car Saturday, then pulling a woman out of the passenger seat and appearing to use a stun gun on a man who was driving. Police Chief Erika Shields called it 'really shocking to watch.' In downtown Los Angeles, a police SUV accelerated into several protesters in a street, knocking two people to the ground. The pair got up and ran onto the sidewalk. Nearby in Santa Monica, not far from a peaceful demonstration, a group broke into a Gap and a Vans sneaker store, where people walked out with boxes of shoes.

City and state officials deployed thousands of National Guard soldiers, enacted strict curfews and shut down mass transit systems to slow protesters' movements, but that did little to stop parts of many cities from again erupting into mayhem. Protesters in Philadelphia hurled rocks and Molotov cocktails at police, officials said, while thieves in more than 20 California cities smashed their way into businesses and ran off with as much as they could carry "" boxes of sneakers, armloads of clothes, and cellphones, TVs and other electronics. In Minneapolis, a tanker truck driver drove into a massive crowd of demonstrators nearly a week after the death of George Floyd, a black man who pleaded for air as an officer pressed a knee into his neck. No protesters appeared to be injured, and the driver was arrested. Tensions spiked outside the White House, the scene of three days of demonstrations, where police fired tear gas and stun grenades into a crowd of more than 1,000 chanting protesters across the street in Lafayette Park. The crowd ran away and piled up road signs and plastic barriers to light a raging fire in a nearby street. Some pulled an American flag from a building and threw it into the blaze. A building in the park with bathrooms and a maintenance office went up in flames and people broke into banks and jewelry stores. As demonstrations persisted past curfew, Washington police said they were responding to multiple fires set around the capital. The entire Washington, D.C., National Guard "" roughly 1,700 soldiers "" was called in to help control the protests, according to two Defense Department officials who insisted on anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the matter. As the protests grew, President Donald Trump retweeted conservative commentator Buck Sexton who called for 'overwhelming force' against violent demonstrators. Secret Service agents had rushed Trump to a White House bunker on Friday night as hundreds of protesters gathered outside the executive mansion, some of them throwing rocks and tugging at police barricades. The president spent nearly an hour in the bunker designed for use in emergencies like terrorist attacks, according to a Republican close to the White House who was not authorized to publicly discuss private matters and spoke on condition of anonymity. The account was confirmed by an administration official who also spoke on condition of anonymity. Former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, visited the site of protests in his hometown of Wilmington, Delaware, and talked to some of the demonstrators. He also wrote a post on Medium expressing empathy for those despairing about the killing of George Floyd. At least 4,400 people have been arrested over days of protests, according to a tally compiled by The Associated Press. Arrests ranged from stealing and blocking highways to breaking curfew. In Salt Lake City, an activist leader condemned the destruction of property but said broken buildings shouldn't be mourned on the same level as black men like Floyd. 'Maybe this country will get the memo that we are sick of police murdering unarmed black men,' said Lex Scott, founder of Black Lives Matter Utah. 'Maybe the next time a white police officer decides to pull the trigger, he will picture cities burning.' Yet thousands still marched peacefully in Phoenix, Albuquerque and other cities, with some calling for an end to the fires, vandalism and theft, saying it weakened calls for justice and reform. 'They keep killing our people,' said Mahira Louis, 15, who marched with her mother and several hundred others in a peaceful protest through downtown Boston. 'I'm so sick and tired of it.' But as night fell that demonstration also descended into violence, with some protesters throwing rocks, bricks and glass bottles at officers and lighting a police vehicle on fire. In downtown Atlanta, authorities fired tear gas to disperse hundreds of demonstrators. Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said two officers had been fired and three placed on desk duty after video showed police surrounding a car Saturday, then pulling a woman out of the passenger seat and appearing to use a stun gun on a man who was driving. Police Chief Erika Shields called it 'really shocking to watch.' In downtown Los Angeles, a police SUV accelerated into several protesters in a street, knocking two people to the ground. The pair got up and ran onto the sidewalk. Nearby in Santa Monica, not far from a peaceful demonstration, a group broke into a Gap and a Vans sneaker store, where people walked out with boxes of shoes.

'After consultation with the California Highway Patrol and Office of Emergency Services, the decision was made this evening to advise all state departments with offices in downtown city areas to close tomorrow, and to notify staff of the decision,' said Amy Palmer, a spokeswoman for the state Government Operations Agency. The directive was sent Sunday evening and it was left up to officials at individual agencies to determine which buildings should be closed. A state Department of Justice memo sent to employees said the attorney general's offices in Sacramento, Oakland, San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego would be closed, though employees who can work from home should do so. 'Staff assigned to these offices should not report to work for any reason. Staff who are able to telework should continue to do so despite the office closures,' the memo said. ___ PORTLAND, Ore. "" Police in Portland deployed tear gas to disperse a large crowd downtown late Sunday night after authorities said projectiles were thrown at officers. Earlier, police said protesters smashed windows at the federal courthouse, and authorities on loudspeakers declared the gathering a civil disturbance. Thousands of people marched throughout Oregon's largest city on Sunday, the third day of George Floyd protests in Portland. For much of the afternoon and evening protesters were largely peaceful, but there were reports of increased violence directed at police into the night. ___ SEOUL, South Korea "" North Korea's official Rodong Sinmun newspaper on Monday reported the demonstrations across the United States in reaction to the death of George Floyd, saying protesters 'harshly condemned' a white police officer's 'lawless and brutal murder' of a black citizen. The article, published with photos, said hundreds of protesters gathered in front of the White House chanting 'No justice, no peace.' It also said there were demonstrations in Minneapolis, New York, Denver, Chicago, Los Angeles and Memphis and that the protests were expected to grow further. ___ Several thousand people marched Monday in New Zealand's largest city, Auckland, to protest George Floyd's death and show solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement. The protesters marched from Aotea Square to the U.S. consulate, where they kneeled. They held banners with slogans such as 'I can't breathe' and 'The Real Virus is Racism.' Hundreds more joined protests and vigils elsewhere in the country, on a day that was a public holiday. The protests were peaceful. Protesters said they were also standing up against police violence and racism in New Zealand. ___ CHARLOTTE, N.C. "" More than 15 people were arrested during protests in Charlotte on Sunday night, the city's police department said. Police said four demonstrators were arrested for assaulting officers, including one for hitting an officer with a rock. Three others were arrested on illegal weapon charges, police said. ___ KANSAS CITY, Missouri "" Shortly after local officials praised what had been a peaceful protest in Kansas City, Missouri, police fired tear gas into the crowd after some demonstrators began lobbing water bottles, law enforcement officials said. A large crowd had gathered at County Club plaza and police had allowed it to slowly dissipate after the city's 8 p.m. curfew took effect. But police used stronger tactics against the smaller crowd that remained when rocks and water bottles started flying and two television station news vehicles were smashed and set on fire. Police declared the scene an 'unlawful assembly' and said the area was clear of activity by midnight. ___ OLYMPIA, Wash. "" Washington Gov. Jay Inslee late Sunday ordered a statewide activation of the National Guard following vandalism and stealing in stores and shopping malls in multiple cities. Inslee had previously authorized 400 troops for Seattle and 200 for Bellevue. On Saturday night people smashed downtown Seattle store fronts and stole items from many businesses, tossing mannequins into the street. On Sunday there were break-ins and thefts in stores and shopping malls in Bellevue, Spokane, Tukwila and Renton. Inslee's activation means more troops will be used to help control unrest. 'We must not let these illegal and dangerous actions detract from the anger so many feel at the deep injustice laid so ugly and bare by the death of George Floyd,' Inslee said in a statement. 'But we also will not turn away from our responsibility to protect the residents of our state.' ___ WASHINGTON "" Break-ins and stealing were rampant in downtown Washington and elsewhere in the city as protests over George Floyd's death turned violent for a third straight night. Protesters broke into a branch of Capital Bank, and empty jewelry boxes could be seen scattered on the sidewalk outside a Mervis Diamonds store. After protesters broke into a La Colombe coffee shop, someone in the crowd yelled, 'What are you looting a coffee shop for? You're messing up the whole message."" ___ NEW YORK "" The mayor of New York City's own daughter is one of the nearly 790 people who have been arrested in the city since protests over the death of George Floyd began last week. A law enforcement official who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter tells The Associated Press that 25-year-old Chiara de Blasio was arrested Saturday night. An arrest report obtained by The New York Post says she refused to leave a Manhattan street ordered cleared by officers because people were throwing things. Chiara de Blasio, who is black, was later given a court summons and released. Mayor Bill de Blasio, who is white, didn't mention the arrest in his Sunday press briefing. City Hall spokespeople didn't have an immediate comment. "" By Michael R. Sisak ___ AUSTIN, Texas "" Police fired rubber bullets and pepper spray late Sunday night at demonstrators who gathered outside the downtown police station in Austin. Live television cameras on Spectrum News showed officers firing several shots into the crowd and several people on the ground. Some people could be seen throwing water bottles at police. The officers were stationed above the crowd on the steps of the police station and a raised section of Interstate 35. Unlike Dallas, where police made dozens of arrests to enforce a downtown curfew, Austin doesn't have a curfew and demonstrators have been roaming downtown from the police station to the state Capitol several blocks away for nearly 10 hours. The crowd has ebbed and flowed from a few thousand to a few hundred. Demonstrators could not get on the Capitol grounds, which were protected by a large police presence. ___ DENVER "" Police fired tear gas and projectiles at demonstrators defying a Denver curfew Sunday night following a day of peaceful marching and chants of 'Don't shoot' alongside boarded-up businesses that had been vandalized the night before. Dozens of demonstrators, some throwing fireworks, taunted police and pushed dumpsters onto Colfax Avenue, a major artery, in the sporadic confrontations that occurred east of downtown. The demonstration over the death of George Floyd came after turbulent protests that led to the arrest of 83 people Saturday night. Denver Mayor Michael Hancock called the behavior of unruly protesters 'reckless, inexcusable and unacceptable.' ___ PHOENIX "" Protests held Sunday night in downtown Phoenix appeared to be peaceful, according to local media reports. An hour before a curfew went into effect, activist Armonee Jackson told protesters in the parking lot of an art gallery downtown that they should avoid any violence, The Arizona Republic reported. 'Listen to me: We are not ending in violence. I refuse to end in violence,' Jackson told the crowd. David Riutta told the newspaper that he came out to protest police brutality and wants to see a panel of civilians investigate officers' use-of-force cases. ___ WASHINGTON "" As demonstrations continued past an 11 p.m. curfew, D.C. police said they were responding to multiple fires that were 'intentionally set' around the city. One was at St. John's Episcopal Church, which is located across Lafayette Park from the White House. The church says every president beginning with James Madison, 'until the present,' has attended a service at the church, giving it the nickname, 'the church of presidents.' The first services at the church were held in 1816, according to its website. ___ WASHINGTON "" The entire Washington, D.C., National Guard "" roughly 1,700 soldiers "" is being called in to help with the response to protests outside the White House and elsewhere in the nation's capital, according to two Defense Department officials. Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser said Sunday she had requested 500 Guardsman to assist local law enforcement. Later on Sunday, as the protests escalated, Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy ordered the rest of the Guardsman "" about 1,200 soldiers "" to report. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the matter. The D.C. National Guard did not reply to a request from The Associated Press for comment. - By James LaPorta ___ WASHINGTON "" Protesters started fires near the White House as tensions with police mounted during a third straight night of demonstrations held in response to the death of George Floyd at police hands in Minnesota. An hour before the 11 p.m. curfew, police fired a major barrage of tear gas stun grenades into the crowd of more than 1,000 people, largely clearing Lafayette Park across the street from the White House and scattering protesters into the street. Protesters piled up road signs and plastic barriers and lit a raging fire in the middle of H Street. Some pulled an American flag from a nearby building and threw it into the blaze. Others added branches pulled from trees. A cinder block structure, on the north side of the park, that had bathrooms and a maintenance office, was engulfed in flames. As the curfew hit, police sealed the perimeter of the park. Shortly beforehand, police pushed a crowd of about 300 demonstrators several blocks with a series of charges with batons and riot shields. Enraged protesters screamed, 'Who do you serve? Who do you protect?' Police shot pepper powders point black at several protesters. Several miles north, a separate protest broke out in Northwest D.C., near the Maryland border. The Metropolitan Police Department says there were break-ins at a Target and a shopping center that houses Neiman Marcus, Saks Fifth Avenue Men's Store, T.J. Maxx, a movie theater and specialty stores. Police say several individuals have been detained. ___ At least 4,100 people have been arrested over days of protests across the country since George Floyd's death Monday, according to a tally compiled by The Associated Press. Arrests ranged from thefts to blocking highways and breaking curfew. The arrest figures as of 11 p.m. EST on Sunday included those from demonstrations in New York and Philadelphia on the East Coast, Chicago and Dallas in the Midwest and Southwest, and Los Angeles on the West Coast as protests take place all over the county. In Dallas, police began sweeping downtown streets with arrests to enforce a curfew that went into effect at 7 p.m. ___ CHARLOTTE, N.C. "" Michael Jordan is 'deeply saddened, truly pained and plain angry.' With protesters taking to the streets across the United States again Sunday, Jordan released a statement on George Floyd and the killings of black people at the hands of police. 'I am deeply saddened, truly pained and plain angry,' the former NBA star and current Charlotte Hornets owner said in the statement posted on the Jordan brand's social media accounts and the team's Twitter account. 'I see and feel everyone's pain, outrage and frustration. I stand with those who are calling out the ingrained racism and violence toward people of color in our country. We have had enough. 'I don't have the answers, but our collective voices show strength and the inability to be divided by others. We must listen to each other, show compassion and empathy and never turn our backs on senseless brutality. We need to continue peaceful expressions against injustice and demand accountability. Our unified voice needs to put pressure on our leaders to change our laws, or else we need to use our vote to create systemic change. Every one of us needs to be part of the solution, and we must work together to ensure justice for all. 'My heart goes out to the family of George Floyd and to the countless others whose lives have been brutally and senselessly taken through acts of racism and injustice.' ___ BOSTON "" A Sunday afternoon of mostly peaceful protests in Boston broke at nightfall when demonstrators clashed with officers, throwing rocks, breaking into several stores and lighting a police vehicle on fire. Boston police tweeted that at least 40 people had been arrested as of 3 a.m. Monday. Police said seven police officers had been hospitalized and 21 police cruisers were damaged.

An overnight curfew took hold at 9 p.m. as some on the fringes of what was a largely peaceful afternoon protest were setting off fireworks and burning construction materials near the park. An Associated Press photographer saw police then begin firing many 40 millimeter canisters of tear gas toward the crowd. People were choking, gasping and some throwing up as they scattered, leaving only a few still in the streets.

The abrupt decision by the agents underscored the rattled mood inside the White House, where the chants from Lafayette Park could be heard all weekend and Secret Service agents and law enforcement officers struggled to contain the crowds. The Friday protests, triggered by the death of George Floyd, a black man who died after he was pinned at the neck by a white Minneapolis police officer, turned violent and appeared to catch officers by surprise. It sparked one of the highest alerts on the White House complex since the Sept. 11 attacks in 2001. In the days since, security at the White House has been reinforced by the National Guard and additional personnel from the Secret Service and the U.S. Park Police. On Sunday, the Justice Department also deployed members of the U.S. Marshals Service and agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration to supplement national guard troops outside the White House, according to a senior Justice Department official.

City and state officials deployed thousands of National Guard soldiers, enacted strict curfews and shut down mass transit systems to slow protesters' movements, but that did little to stop parts of many cities from again erupting into mayhem. Protesters in Philadelphia hurled rocks and Molotov cocktails at police, officials said, while thieves in more than 20 California cities smashed their way into businesses and ran off with as much as they could carry "" boxes of sneakers, armloads of clothes, and cellphones, TVs and other electronics. In Minneapolis, a tanker truck driver drove into a massive crowd of demonstrators nearly a week after the death of George Floyd, a black man who pleaded for air as an officer pressed a knee into his neck. No protesters appeared to be injured, and the driver was arrested. Tensions spiked outside the White House, the scene of three days of demonstrations, where police fired tear gas and stun grenades into a crowd of more than 1,000 chanting protesters across the street in Lafayette Park. The crowd ran away and piled up road signs and plastic barriers to light a raging fire in a nearby street. Some pulled an American flag from a building and threw it into the blaze. A building in the park with bathrooms and a maintenance office went up in flames and people broke into banks and jewelry stores. As demonstrations persisted past curfew, Washington police said they were responding to multiple fires set around the capital. The entire Washington, D.C., National Guard "" roughly 1,700 soldiers "" was called in to help control the protests, according to two Defense Department officials who insisted on anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the matter. As the protests grew, President Donald Trump retweeted conservative commentator Buck Sexton who called for 'overwhelming force' against violent demonstrators. Secret Service agents had rushed Trump to a White House bunker on Friday night as hundreds of protesters gathered outside the executive mansion, some of them throwing rocks and tugging at police barricades. The president spent nearly an hour in the bunker designed for use in emergencies like terrorist attacks, according to a Republican close to the White House who was not authorized to publicly discuss private matters and spoke on condition of anonymity. The account was confirmed by an administration official who also spoke on condition of anonymity. Former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, visited the site of protests in his hometown of Wilmington, Delaware, and talked to some of the demonstrators. He also wrote a post on Medium expressing empathy for those despairing about the killing of George Floyd. At least 4,400 people have been arrested over days of protests, according to a tally compiled by The Associated Press. Arrests ranged from stealing and blocking highways to breaking curfew. In Salt Lake City, an activist leader condemned the destruction of property but said broken buildings shouldn't be mourned on the same level as black men like Floyd. 'Maybe this country will get the memo that we are sick of police murdering unarmed black men,' said Lex Scott, founder of Black Lives Matter Utah. 'Maybe the next time a white police officer decides to pull the trigger, he will picture cities burning.' Yet thousands still marched peacefully in Phoenix, Albuquerque and other cities, with some calling for an end to the fires, vandalism and theft, saying it weakened calls for justice and reform. 'They keep killing our people,' said Mahira Louis, 15, who marched with her mother and several hundred others in a peaceful protest through downtown Boston. 'I'm so sick and tired of it.' But as night fell that demonstration also descended into violence, with some protesters throwing rocks, bricks and glass bottles at officers and lighting a police vehicle on fire. In downtown Atlanta, authorities fired tear gas to disperse hundreds of demonstrators. Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said two officers had been fired and three placed on desk duty after video showed police surrounding a car Saturday, then pulling a woman out of the passenger seat and appearing to use a stun gun on a man who was driving. Police Chief Erika Shields called it 'really shocking to watch.' In downtown Los Angeles, a police SUV accelerated into several protesters in a street, knocking two people to the ground. The pair got up and ran onto the sidewalk. Nearby in Santa Monica, not far from a peaceful demonstration, a group broke into a Gap and a Vans sneaker store, where people walked out with boxes of shoes. Others shattered the windows of an REI outdoor supply store and snatched folding chairs, a bike and backpacks. A fire broke out at a restaurant across the street. About 30 miles (48 kilometers) south, as hundreds of protesters gathered in Long Beach, scores of thieves swarmed into nearby outlet stores. A steady stream emerged from a Forever 21 store carrying armloads of clothing. Some hauled it away in garbage bags, and a few stopped outside to change into stolen items. In Minneapolis, the officer who pressed his knee onto Floyd's neck has been charged with murder, but protesters are demanding the other three officers at the scene be prosecuted. All four were fired. 'We're not done,' said Darnella Wade, an organizer for Black Lives Matter in neighboring St. Paul, where thousands gathered peacefully in front of the state Capitol as state patrolmen and National Guard soldiers lined up in front of about a dozen military-style armored vehicles. ""They sent us the military, and we only asked them for arrests.' Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz brought in thousands of National Guard soldiers on Saturday to help quell violence that had damaged or destroyed hundreds of buildings in Minneapolis over days of protests. That appeared to help minimize unrest both Saturday and Sunday. Disgust over generations of racism in a country founded by slaveholders combined with a string of recent racially charged killings to stoke the anger. Adding to that was angst from months of lockdowns brought on by the coronavirus pandemic, which has disproportionately hurt communities of color, not only in terms of infections but in job losses and economic stress. The droves of people congregating for demonstrations threatened to trigger new outbreaks, a fact overshadowed by the boiling tensions. The scale of the coast-to-coast protests rivaled the historic demonstrations of the civil rights and Vietnam War eras. Curfews were imposed in major cities around the U.S., including Atlanta, Chicago, Denver, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Seattle. About 5,000 National Guard soldiers and airmen were activated in 15 states and Washington, D.C. In Indianapolis, two people were reported dead in bursts of downtown violence this weekend, adding to deaths reported in Detroit and Minneapolis in recent days. In tweets Sunday, Trump blamed anarchists and the media for fueling violence. Attorney General William Barr pointed a finger at 'far left extremist' groups. Police chiefs and politicians accused outsiders of coming in and causing the problems. At the Minneapolis intersection where Floyd was killed, people gathered with brooms and flowers, saying it was important to protect what they called a 'sacred space.' Among in Minneapolis was Michael Brown Sr., the father of Michael Brown, whose killing by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, set off unrest in 2014. 'I understand what this family is feeling. I understand what this community is feeling,' he said. ___ Morrison and Sullivan reported from Minneapolis.

'After consultation with the California Highway Patrol and Office of Emergency Services, the decision was made this evening to advise all state departments with offices in downtown city areas to close tomorrow, and to notify staff of the decision,' said Amy Palmer, a spokeswoman for the state Government Operations Agency. The directive was sent Sunday evening and it was left up to officials at individual agencies to determine which buildings should be closed. A state Department of Justice memo sent to employees said the attorney general's offices in Sacramento, Oakland, San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego would be closed, though employees who can work from home should do so. 'Staff assigned to these offices should not report to work for any reason. Staff who are able to telework should continue to do so despite the office closures,' the memo said. ___ PORTLAND, Ore. "" Police in Portland deployed tear gas to disperse a large crowd downtown late Sunday night after authorities said projectiles were thrown at officers. Earlier, police said protesters smashed windows at the federal courthouse, and authorities on loudspeakers declared the gathering a civil disturbance. Thousands of people marched throughout Oregon's largest city on Sunday, the third day of George Floyd protests in Portland. For much of the afternoon and evening protesters were largely peaceful, but there were reports of increased violence directed at police into the night. ___ SEOUL, South Korea "" North Korea's official Rodong Sinmun newspaper on Monday reported the demonstrations across the United States in reaction to the death of George Floyd, saying protesters 'harshly condemned' a white police officer's 'lawless and brutal murder' of a black citizen. The article, published with photos, said hundreds of protesters gathered in front of the White House chanting 'No justice, no peace.' It also said there were demonstrations in Minneapolis, New York, Denver, Chicago, Los Angeles and Memphis and that the protests were expected to grow further. ___ Several thousand people marched Monday in New Zealand's largest city, Auckland, to protest George Floyd's death and show solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement. The protesters marched from Aotea Square to the U.S. consulate, where they kneeled. They held banners with slogans such as 'I can't breathe' and 'The Real Virus is Racism.' Hundreds more joined protests and vigils elsewhere in the country, on a day that was a public holiday. The protests were peaceful. Protesters said they were also standing up against police violence and racism in New Zealand. ___ CHARLOTTE, N.C. "" More than 15 people were arrested during protests in Charlotte on Sunday night, the city's police department said. Police said four demonstrators were arrested for assaulting officers, including one for hitting an officer with a rock. Three others were arrested on illegal weapon charges, police said. ___ KANSAS CITY, Missouri "" Shortly after local officials praised what had been a peaceful protest in Kansas City, Missouri, police fired tear gas into the crowd after some demonstrators began lobbing water bottles, law enforcement officials said. A large crowd had gathered at County Club plaza and police had allowed it to slowly dissipate after the city's 8 p.m. curfew took effect. But police used stronger tactics against the smaller crowd that remained when rocks and water bottles started flying and two television station news vehicles were smashed and set on fire. Police declared the scene an 'unlawful assembly' and said the area was clear of activity by midnight. ___ OLYMPIA, Wash. "" Washington Gov. Jay Inslee late Sunday ordered a statewide activation of the National Guard following vandalism and stealing in stores and shopping malls in multiple cities. Inslee had previously authorized 400 troops for Seattle and 200 for Bellevue. On Saturday night people smashed downtown Seattle store fronts and stole items from many businesses, tossing mannequins into the street. On Sunday there were break-ins and thefts in stores and shopping malls in Bellevue, Spokane, Tukwila and Renton. Inslee's activation means more troops will be used to help control unrest. 'We must not let these illegal and dangerous actions detract from the anger so many feel at the deep injustice laid so ugly and bare by the death of George Floyd,' Inslee said in a statement. 'But we also will not turn away from our responsibility to protect the residents of our state.' ___ WASHINGTON "" Break-ins and stealing were rampant in downtown Washington and elsewhere in the city as protests over George Floyd's death turned violent for a third straight night. Protesters broke into a branch of Capital Bank, and empty jewelry boxes could be seen scattered on the sidewalk outside a Mervis Diamonds store. After protesters broke into a La Colombe coffee shop, someone in the crowd yelled, 'What are you looting a coffee shop for? You're messing up the whole message."" ___ NEW YORK "" The mayor of New York City's own daughter is one of the nearly 790 people who have been arrested in the city since protests over the death of George Floyd began last week. A law enforcement official who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter tells The Associated Press that 25-year-old Chiara de Blasio was arrested Saturday night. An arrest report obtained by The New York Post says she refused to leave a Manhattan street ordered cleared by officers because people were throwing things. Chiara de Blasio, who is black, was later given a court summons and released. Mayor Bill de Blasio, who is white, didn't mention the arrest in his Sunday press briefing. City Hall spokespeople didn't have an immediate comment. "" By Michael R. Sisak ___ AUSTIN, Texas "" Police fired rubber bullets and pepper spray late Sunday night at demonstrators who gathered outside the downtown police station in Austin. Live television cameras on Spectrum News showed officers firing several shots into the crowd and several people on the ground. Some people could be seen throwing water bottles at police. The officers were stationed above the crowd on the steps of the police station and a raised section of Interstate 35. Unlike Dallas, where police made dozens of arrests to enforce a downtown curfew, Austin doesn't have a curfew and demonstrators have been roaming downtown from the police station to the state Capitol several blocks away for nearly 10 hours. The crowd has ebbed and flowed from a few thousand to a few hundred. Demonstrators could not get on the Capitol grounds, which were protected by a large police presence. ___ DENVER "" Police fired tear gas and projectiles at demonstrators defying a Denver curfew Sunday night following a day of peaceful marching and chants of 'Don't shoot' alongside boarded-up businesses that had been vandalized the night before. Dozens of demonstrators, some throwing fireworks, taunted police and pushed dumpsters onto Colfax Avenue, a major artery, in the sporadic confrontations that occurred east of downtown. The demonstration over the death of George Floyd came after turbulent protests that led to the arrest of 83 people Saturday night. Denver Mayor Michael Hancock called the behavior of unruly protesters 'reckless, inexcusable and unacceptable.' ___ PHOENIX "" Protests held Sunday night in downtown Phoenix appeared to be peaceful, according to local media reports. An hour before a curfew went into effect, activist Armonee Jackson told protesters in the parking lot of an art gallery downtown that they should avoid any violence, The Arizona Republic reported. 'Listen to me: We are not ending in violence. I refuse to end in violence,' Jackson told the crowd. David Riutta told the newspaper that he came out to protest police brutality and wants to see a panel of civilians investigate officers' use-of-force cases. ___ WASHINGTON "" As demonstrations continued past an 11 p.m. curfew, D.C. police said they were responding to multiple fires that were 'intentionally set' around the city. One was at St. John's Episcopal Church, which is located across Lafayette Park from the White House. The church says every president beginning with James Madison, 'until the present,' has attended a service at the church, giving it the nickname, 'the church of presidents.' The first services at the church were held in 1816, according to its website. ___ WASHINGTON "" The entire Washington, D.C., National Guard "" roughly 1,700 soldiers "" is being called in to help with the response to protests outside the White House and elsewhere in the nation's capital, according to two Defense Department officials. Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser said Sunday she had requested 500 Guardsman to assist local law enforcement. Later on Sunday, as the protests escalated, Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy ordered the rest of the Guardsman "" about 1,200 soldiers "" to report. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the matter. The D.C. National Guard did not reply to a request from The Associated Press for comment. - By James LaPorta ___ WASHINGTON "" Protesters started fires near the White House as tensions with police mounted during a third straight night of demonstrations held in response to the death of George Floyd at police hands in Minnesota. An hour before the 11 p.m. curfew, police fired a major barrage of tear gas stun grenades into the crowd of more than 1,000 people, largely clearing Lafayette Park across the street from the White House and scattering protesters into the street. Protesters piled up road signs and plastic barriers and lit a raging fire in the middle of H Street. Some pulled an American flag from a nearby building and threw it into the blaze. Others added branches pulled from trees. A cinder block structure, on the north side of the park, that had bathrooms and a maintenance office, was engulfed in flames. As the curfew hit, police sealed the perimeter of the park. Shortly beforehand, police pushed a crowd of about 300 demonstrators several blocks with a series of charges with batons and riot shields. Enraged protesters screamed, 'Who do you serve? Who do you protect?' Police shot pepper powders point black at several protesters. Several miles north, a separate protest broke out in Northwest D.C., near the Maryland border. The Metropolitan Police Department says there were break-ins at a Target and a shopping center that houses Neiman Marcus, Saks Fifth Avenue Men's Store, T.J. Maxx, a movie theater and specialty stores. Police say several individuals have been detained. ___ At least 4,100 people have been arrested over days of protests across the country since George Floyd's death Monday, according to a tally compiled by The Associated Press. Arrests ranged from thefts to blocking highways and breaking curfew. The arrest figures as of 11 p.m. EST on Sunday included those from demonstrations in New York and Philadelphia on the East Coast, Chicago and Dallas in the Midwest and Southwest, and Los Angeles on the West Coast as protests take place all over the county. In Dallas, police began sweeping downtown streets with arrests to enforce a curfew that went into effect at 7 p.m. ___ CHARLOTTE, N.C. "" Michael Jordan is 'deeply saddened, truly pained and plain angry.' With protesters taking to the streets across the United States again Sunday, Jordan released a statement on George Floyd and the killings of black people at the hands of police. 'I am deeply saddened, truly pained and plain angry,' the former NBA star and current Charlotte Hornets owner said in the statement posted on the Jordan brand's social media accounts and the team's Twitter account. 'I see and feel everyone's pain, outrage and frustration. I stand with those who are calling out the ingrained racism and violence toward people of color in our country. We have had enough. 'I don't have the answers, but our collective voices show strength and the inability to be divided by others. We must listen to each other, show compassion and empathy and never turn our backs on senseless brutality. We need to continue peaceful expressions against injustice and demand accountability. Our unified voice needs to put pressure on our leaders to change our laws, or else we need to use our vote to create systemic change. Every one of us needs to be part of the solution, and we must work together to ensure justice for all. 'My heart goes out to the family of George Floyd and to the countless others whose lives have been brutally and senselessly taken through acts of racism and injustice.' ___ BOSTON "" A Sunday afternoon of mostly peaceful protests in Boston broke at nightfall when demonstrators clashed with officers, throwing rocks, breaking into several stores and lighting a police vehicle on fire. Boston police tweeted that at least 40 people had been arrested as of 3 a.m. Monday. Police said seven police officers had been hospitalized and 21 police cruisers were damaged. A National Guard unit was called in to help quell the unrest. Republican Gov. Charlie Baker called the violence 'criminal and cowardly' in a tweet.

In more than 20 cities, thieves smashed their way into businesses and ran off with as much as they could carry "" boxes of sneakers, armloads of clothes and cellphones and TVs. Nearly 400 people were arrested in Los Angeles from unrest Saturday as protests have become increasingly violent over several nights because of outrage over the Minneapolis police killing of George Floyd, Police Chief Michel Moore said. Moore said he hoped the National Guard and additional officers deployed would help. But before the sun set, there was brazen looting in Santa Monica and Long Beach even while nearby protests were mostly peaceful. Violence statewide include an arm wound suffered by a gunshot victim in Walnut Creek. Across the state, devastated shop owners cleaned up. In Emeryville, across the bay from San Francisco, where thieves stormed malls late Saturday, Keyla Calderon swept up glass outside the medical scrubs shop Uniform Advantage. Calderon's store had just reopened after being shuttered for six weeks under California's orders to stem spread of the coronavirus. She said she had just returned home Saturday when she learned the burglar alarm was triggered. She turned on the news to see scenes of people breaking into her shop and others. 'To hear the alarm ring and see people destroy the store before my eyes, it was heartbreaking,' Calderon said. ""We're all working hard to feed our family. We have nothing to do with these injustices, yet we're paying the consequences.' Gov. Gavin Newsom deployed 1,000 members of the Guard to assist the 20,000 officers of the Los Angeles police and sheriff's departments, Mayor Eric Garcetti said. The San Francisco police chief said about 200 outside officers were en route. Humvees lined up outside Los Angeles City Hall, and troops stood behind police on the steps of the building as protesters gathered despite a curfew. Unrest in Santa Monica happened not far from a peaceful demonstration near the city's famous pier as looters targeted shops near the popular Third Street Promenade. They broke into a Gap store and a Vans sneaker store, walking out with boxes with no police in sight. A woman holding a sign saying 'End All Violence' tried to block a man with a hammer from smashing the door of an REI store. The man yanked her from the door. She returned to the doorway and another protester joined her and the vandals eventually moved on. But others later made off with merchandise. As protesters gathered in Long Beach, thieves swarmed nearby stores at The Pike Outlets. A Forever 21 store was a favored target, and a steady stream emerged carrying armloads of clothing. Some stopped to change into stolen items. A bizarre scene unfolded about a half-mile away when people stealing from a clothing store became trapped inside as police gathered outside the mostly boarded-up store front. A woman screamed inside and then a man kicked his way out a window above the plywood and dropped to the sidewalk. He was followed by more than a half-dozen others, with one man throwing out an armload of clothes and then gathering them up and running off as police nearby didn't attempt to make arrests. About 1,000 people marched through the streets of San Francisco, carrying signs and chanting 'George Floyd,' 'Black Lives Matter.' 'We're here because George Floyd was murdered in cold blood,"" Aliasiah Allah said. In San Diego, a protest took an ominous turn after several hours when police said they fired tear gas to disperse a crowd pelting them with rocks and bottles. In Los Angeles, damage from Saturday's violence included windows shattered at nearly every shop along a stretch of trendy Melrose Avenue. Alan Kokozian looked up through a hole in the roof of Tony K's Shoe Store, where fire had burned and most of his inventory was stolen or damaged. He had pleaded for people to spare his establishment and was struck in the head with a bottle. 'This was not a political protest,' Kokozian said. Officials acknowledged the anger of protesters over the death of Floyd, a handcuffed black man who died after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee to Floyd's neck, and affirmed their right to demonstrate. But they condemned the wave of crime by a small number that had overshadowed the protest message. 'It breaks my heart, too, to think about the Angelenos protesting in peace and fighting for justice how this violence and looting clouds that picture,"" Garcetti said. Yet it was hard to ignore images of police cars engulfed in flames in Los Angeles, people running out the broken door of an Alexander McQueen luxury clothing store on Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills or demonstrators tossing fireworks at officers in Santa Ana. There was also video of officers in skirmish lines in LA, some swinging clubs at protesters, others firing projectiles at people with their hands up and crowds running from a cloud of tear gas in Beverly Hills. Garcetti praised the 99.99% of officers he said had shown restraint. Moore, who was on the front lines Saturday, said officers had acted appropriately, though he acknowledged some 'individual failures.' Five LAPD officers were injured in the clashes and two hospitalized, including one who required surgery after his skull was fractured by a brick, Moore said. San Francisco's popular Union Square saw people stealing leather bags from the Coach store and shoes from the Salvatore Ferragamo location, The Mercury News reported. Streets were littered with bras from Victoria's Secret and cushioned jewelry boxes from Swarovski. Mayor London Breed said the city's 8 p.m. curfew would be extended indefinitely. Breed expressed sadness about the destruction and said she was not going to tolerate the violence. 'I was extremely upset because unfortunately with some of the vandals, they thought this was a game, they thought this was funny,"" Breed said. Protests also roiled the east San Diego suburb of La Mesa, where two adjacent banks burned to the ground.

In more than 20 cities, thieves smashed their way into businesses and ran off with as much as they could carry "" boxes of sneakers, armloads of clothes and cellphones and TVs. Nearly 400 people were arrested in Los Angeles from unrest Saturday as protests have become increasingly violent over several nights because of outrage over the Minneapolis police killing of George Floyd, Police Chief Michel Moore said. Moore said he hoped the National Guard and additional officers deployed would help. But before the sun set, there was brazen looting in Santa Monica and Long Beach even while nearby protests were mostly peaceful. Violence statewide include an arm wound suffered by a gunshot victim in Walnut Creek. Across the state, devastated shop owners cleaned up. In Emeryville, across the bay from San Francisco, where thieves stormed malls late Saturday, Keyla Calderon swept up glass outside the medical scrubs shop Uniform Advantage. Calderon's store had just reopened after being shuttered for six weeks under California's orders to stem spread of the coronavirus. She said she had just returned home Saturday when she learned the burglar alarm was triggered. She turned on the news to see scenes of people breaking into her shop and others. 'To hear the alarm ring and see people destroy the store before my eyes, it was heartbreaking,' Calderon said. ""We're all working hard to feed our family. We have nothing to do with these injustices, yet we're paying the consequences.' Gov. Gavin Newsom deployed 1,000 members of the Guard to assist the 20,000 officers of the Los Angeles police and sheriff's departments, Mayor Eric Garcetti said. The San Francisco police chief said about 200 outside officers were en route. Humvees lined up outside Los Angeles City Hall, and troops stood behind police on the steps of the building as protesters gathered despite a curfew. Unrest in Santa Monica happened not far from a peaceful demonstration near the city's famous pier as looters targeted shops near the popular Third Street Promenade. They broke into a Gap store and a Vans sneaker store, walking out with boxes with no police in sight. A woman holding a sign saying 'End All Violence' tried to block a man with a hammer from smashing the door of an REI store. The man yanked her from the door.

(AP) "" It's the stuff of nightmares: Breonna Taylor and her boyfriend were in bed when a trio of armed men smashed through the front door. Gunfire erupted, killing the 26-year-old black woman. The three men turned out to be plainclothes police detectives, one of whom was wounded in the chaos and violence that March night. Taylor's death led to protests and a review of how Louisville police use ""no knock"" search warrants, which allow officers to enter a home without announcing their presence, often in drug cases to prevent suspects from getting rid of a stash. Taylor's name is one of those being chanted during nationwide protests decrying police killings of black people. The unrest began after the death of George Floyd, a black man who pleaded that he couldn't breathe as a white Minneapolis police officer pinned him to the ground with a knee. More than two months after Taylor's death, Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer announced last week that the police department's use of no-knock warrants has been suspended indefinitely. Civil rights advocates are calling for a permanent ban, though Oregon and Florida are the only states that have outlawed such warrants. Fischer changed the policy after an outcry from Taylor's family and they sued the department and the three officers who served the warrant. The new policy requires Louisville's police chief to sign off on all no-knock warrants before they go to a judge. 'These changes, and more to come ... should signal that I hear the community and we will continue to make improvements anywhere that we can,' Fischer said. The three narcotics detectives had a no-knock warrant when they busted down the door of Taylor's apartment after midnight on March 13. They were investigating a drug dealer named Jamarcus Glover, who was arrested elsewhere the same day. Police said Glover was using Taylor's address to receive packages they believed could be drugs. No drugs were found at her apartment. Tom Wine, the city's top criminal prosecutor, said he believes police knocked and announced their presence. ""Simply because the police get a no-knock warrant does not mean they can't knock and announce,' Wine said last week. But the lawsuit filed on behalf of Taylor's mother says neighbors didn't hear the plainclothes detectives knock or identify themselves as officers before they crashed into the apartment. Taylor's boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, told investigators that he thought he was being robbed or that it might be an ex-boyfriend of Taylor's trying to get in. Walker told police he heard knocking but didn't know who it was. He said he and Taylor were moving toward the door when it was knocked down, so he fired a shot that hit an officer. Authorities had charged Walker with attempted murder but dropped the case last week. Wine said he wanted to let state and federal authorities complete their review of the shooting. Meanwhile, the American Civil Liberties Union of Kentucky has urged city leaders to ban no-knock warrants, saying they lead to the deaths of innocent people. A 2014 ACLU report on police militarization detailed several botched SWAT team raids as no-knock warrants were served, including one that year in Georgia that ended with a toddler in a medically induced coma. More recently, police in Montgomery County, Maryland, shot and killed 21-year-old Duncan Lemp in his family's home while serving a no-knock search warrant. An eyewitness said Lemp was asleep in his bedroom when police opened fire from outside his house, according to an attorney for his family. Police said Lemp, who was white, was armed with a rifle and ignored commands. Lemp family attorney Rene Sandler said police began using no-knock warrants decades ago as a tool in the nation's war on drugs. They have become the 'norm' for many kinds of criminal cases, including non-violent offenses, she said. 'It's an abuse of authority across the board,' said Sandler, a former county prosecutor. Law enforcement consultant Melvin Tucker, who's been a police chief in four cities in the U.S. South, said the element of surprise afforded by no-knock warrants isn't always justified. 'If you're going in on a drug case where the quantity is so small that they could dispose of it by flushing it down the toilet, you probably shouldn't be there with a search warrant in the first place. It's not worthwhile,' said Tucker, who has been an expert witness in dozens of court cases. The number of no-knock warrants served during SWAT team deployments has grown from approximately 1,500 annually in the early 1980s to about 45,000 in 2010, according to Eastern Kentucky University professor Peter Kraska, an expert in police militarization. He said police are adept at working around restrictions and tailoring paperwork to suit the standards of judges issuing search warrants. 'Banning no-knock warrants, if any jurisdiction can pull that off, is an important step,' Kraska said. 'At the end of the day, banning them probably won't accomplish much in the real world. But getting them off the books on one level is important.' Kentucky has a 'stand your ground' law that gives residents the right to use deadly force against an intruder. Those laws generally haven't protected people who unwittingly shoot at officers entering their homes, but Walker's dropped charges suggests the circumstances of Taylor's death could be an 'ideologically compatible situation for the left and right,' Kraska said. 'These different groups that normally would be at odds with one another all agree on the inappropriateness of no-knock warrants,' he added. 'There's been a lot more political agreement that this is problematic.' ___ Kunzelman reported from Silver Spring, Maryland. Sainz reported from Memphis, Tennessee.",0.0

1621994298,2020-05-31 22:44:48,Protests peaceful in Boston by day turn violent at nightfall,https://www.providencejournal.com/news/20200531/protests-peaceful-in-boston-by-day-turn-violent-at-nightfall?rssfeed=true,en,False,,68874,providencejournal.com,http://www.providencejournal.com/#spider,"BOSTON — A Sunday afternoon of mostly peaceful protests in Boston broke at nightfall when protesters clashed with officers, throwing rocks, breaking into several stores and lighting a police vehicle on fire. Thousands of mostly mask-wearing demonstrators marched peacefully through Boston in several protests during the day, lending their voices to the nationwide anger over the death of George Floyd, a black man who died Monday after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee on his neck as he pleaded for air. The largest protest of several thousand started Sunday night in the historically black neighborhood of Roxbury. Protesters carrying ""Black Lives Matter"" signs and chanting ""The people united will never be defeated"" made their way slowly for several miles to the Massachusetts State House. The diverse and peaceful crowd was flanked by police officers on bikes. But as the march ended around 9 p.m., protesters clashed with police in downtown Boston. A police cruiser's rear window was smashed by a skateboarder. Police also tweeted that their officers were pelted with bricks, rocks, and glass bottles. As of 3 a.m. Monday, seven police officers had been hospitalized, 21 police cruisers were damaged and around 40 people were arrested, the department tweeted, calling the situation active. Protesters stole items from several stores including a Walgreens and a shoe store and damaged other several storefronts including a bank. A National Guard unit was called in to help quell the violence around 11 p.m. ""Tonight’s protests were motivated by a righteous desire for equality, justice, and accountability in our country. I see you. I hear you. I will use my voice for you,"" Boston Mayor Marty Walsh said in a statement. ""I am angered, however, by the people who came into our city and chose to engage in acts of destruction and violence, undermining their message,"" he said. ""If we are to achieve change and if we are to lead the change, our efforts must be rooted in peace and regard for our community."" Gov. Charlie Baker criticized the violence in a tweet, calling it ""criminal and cowardly"" and saying it ""distracted from the powerful statement made today by thousands of Massachusetts residents."" Earlier in the day, hundreds of people, including several families, marched through downtown Boston on Sunday carrying signs reading ""Justice for George"" and ""Silence is betrayal,"" among others, and chanting ""Hands up, don't shoot."" Orderly but energized and angry at times, the crowd took over one side of a city street as they passed City Hall, the State House, and the Public Garden. Some passing motorists honked in support, and in one case, several bikers revved their motorcycles, prompting cheers from the crowd. The demonstration then gathered in Boston Common, an iconic park in the heart of Boston, with some kneeling for several minutes in memory of Floyd and raising their fists in the air. The earlier peaceful nature of the protests was in stark contrast to violence that has rocked cities across the country in recent days in response to the death of Floyd. ""They keep killing our people. I’m so sick and tired of it,"" said Mahira Louis, 15, who was at the afternoon protest with her mother and was leading chants of ""George Floyd, say his name."" ""On the news, every time we say black lives matter they keep silencing us. Things are going to change. It's going to change around here. They’re not going to kill black people for no reason."" Others said the killing of Floyd on top of the coronavirus that has disproportionately hit communities of color and resulted in job losses made it imperative they come out and protest. ""The recent events between COVID, the killing of George Floyd, the injustices this society is sort of predicated on are just surfacing in a very undeniable way,"" said Silvian Castaneda, a 62-year-old social worker from Medford who came to the rally with several family members and friends. ""We've got to do something."" The safety concerns of the coronavirus were also on the minds of protesters, many who wore masks but rarely practiced social distancing. They were packed shoulder to shoulder as they marched which had several of them a little anxious. ""It isn't comfortable to be at home but it's really uncomfortable to be here, too, and know you're doing this in the face of the COVID-19 crisis,"" said Vivian Lee, 22, who participated with her sister and parents. ""But it requires some discomfort for change."" A third protest featured church leaders who rallied outside Boston police headquarters, according to The Boston Globe. After speaking out against police brutality as well as income inequality and lack of coronavirus testing, the crowd observed a moment of silence for 8 minutes and 49 seconds, a reference to the several minutes the officer pressed his knee to Floyd's neck.",0.0

Violence statewide include an arm wound suffered by a gunshot victim in Walnut Creek. Across the state, devastated shop owners cleaned up. In Emeryville, across the bay from San Francisco, where thieves stormed malls late Saturday, Keyla Calderon swept up glass outside the medical scrubs shop Uniform Advantage. Calderon's store had just reopened after being shuttered for six weeks under California's orders to stem spread of the coronavirus. She said she had just returned home Saturday when she learned the burglar alarm was triggered. She turned on the news to see scenes of people breaking into her shop and others. 'To hear the alarm ring and see people destroy the store before my eyes, it was heartbreaking,' Calderon said. ""We're all working hard to feed our family. We have nothing to do with these injustices, yet we're paying the consequences.' Gov. Gavin Newsom deployed 1,000 members of the Guard to assist the 20,000 officers of the Los Angeles police and sheriff's departments, Mayor Eric Garcetti said. The San Francisco police chief said about 200 outside officers were en route. Humvees lined up outside Los Angeles City Hall, and troops stood behind police on the steps of the building as protesters gathered despite a curfew. Unrest in Santa Monica happened not far from a peaceful demonstration near the city's famous pier as looters targeted shops near the popular Third Street Promenade. They broke into a Gap store and a Vans sneaker store, walking out with boxes with no police in sight. A woman holding a sign saying 'End All Violence' tried to block a man with a hammer from smashing the door of an REI store. The man yanked her from the door. She returned to the doorway and another protester joined her and the vandals eventually moved on. But others later made off with merchandise. As protesters gathered in Long Beach, thieves swarmed nearby stores at The Pike Outlets. A Forever 21 store was a favored target, and a steady stream emerged carrying armloads of clothing. Some stopped to change into stolen items. A bizarre scene unfolded about a half-mile away when people stealing from a clothing store became trapped inside as police gathered outside the mostly boarded-up store front. A woman screamed inside and then a man kicked his way out a window above the plywood and dropped to the sidewalk. He was followed by more than a half-dozen others, with one man throwing out an armload of clothes and then gathering them up and running off as police nearby didn't attempt to make arrests. About 1,000 people marched through the streets of San Francisco, carrying signs and chanting 'George Floyd,' 'Black Lives Matter.' 'We're here because George Floyd was murdered in cold blood,"" Aliasiah Allah said. In San Diego, a protest took an ominous turn after several hours when police said they fired tear gas to disperse a crowd pelting them with rocks and bottles. In Los Angeles, damage from Saturday's violence included windows shattered at nearly every shop along a stretch of trendy Melrose Avenue. Alan Kokozian looked up through a hole in the roof of Tony K's Shoe Store, where fire had burned and most of his inventory was stolen or damaged. He had pleaded for people to spare his establishment and was struck in the head with a bottle. 'This was not a political protest,' Kokozian said. Officials acknowledged the anger of protesters over the death of Floyd, a handcuffed black man who died after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee to Floyd's neck, and affirmed their right to demonstrate. But they condemned the wave of crime by a small number that had overshadowed the protest message. 'It breaks my heart, too, to think about the Angelenos protesting in peace and fighting for justice how this violence and looting clouds that picture,"" Garcetti said. Yet it was hard to ignore images of police cars engulfed in flames in Los Angeles, people running out the broken door of an Alexander McQueen luxury clothing store on Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills or demonstrators tossing fireworks at officers in Santa Ana. There was also video of officers in skirmish lines in LA, some swinging clubs at protesters, others firing projectiles at people with their hands up and crowds running from a cloud of tear gas in Beverly Hills. Garcetti praised the 99.99% of officers he said had shown restraint. Moore, who was on the front lines Saturday, said officers had acted appropriately, though he acknowledged some 'individual failures.' Five LAPD officers were injured in the clashes and two hospitalized, including one who required surgery after his skull was fractured by a brick, Moore said. San Francisco's popular Union Square saw people stealing leather bags from the Coach store and shoes from the Salvatore Ferragamo location, The Mercury News reported. Streets were littered with bras from Victoria's Secret and cushioned jewelry boxes from Swarovski. Mayor London Breed said the city's 8 p.m. curfew would be extended indefinitely. Breed expressed sadness about the destruction and said she was not going to tolerate the violence. 'I was extremely upset because unfortunately with some of the vandals, they thought this was a game, they thought this was funny,"" Breed said. Protests also roiled the east San Diego suburb of La Mesa, where two adjacent banks burned to the ground. 'I think people are hurting and they're angry and they're trying to be heard because there's no other way to get anyone's attention,' Ally Kaiahua said of the property damage in La Mesa. ___ Nguyen reported from Emeryville.

1622001672,2020-06-02 00:36:10,Deadly police raid fuels call to end 'no knock' warrants,https://www.providencejournal.com/ZZ/news/20200601/deadly-police-raid-fuels-call-to-end-no-knock-warrants?rssfeed=true,en,True,,68874,providencejournal.com,http://www.providencejournal.com/#spider,"LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) "" It's the stuff of nightmares: Breonna Taylor and her boyfriend were in bed when a trio of armed men smashed through the front door. Gunfire erupted, killing the 26-year-old black woman. The three men turned out to be plainclothes police detectives, one of whom was wounded in the chaos and violence that March night. Taylor's death led to protests and a review of how Louisville police use ""no knock"" search warrants, which allow officers to enter a home without announcing their presence, often in drug cases to prevent suspects from getting rid of a stash. Taylor's name is one of those being chanted during nationwide protests decrying police killings of black people. The unrest began after the death of George Floyd, a black man who pleaded that he couldn't breathe as a white Minneapolis police officer pinned him to the ground with a knee. More than two months after Taylor's death, Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer announced last week that the police department's use of no-knock warrants has been suspended indefinitely. Civil rights advocates are calling for a permanent ban, though Oregon and Florida are the only states that have outlawed such warrants. Fischer changed the policy after an outcry from Taylor's family and they sued the department and the three officers who served the warrant. The new policy requires Louisville's police chief to sign off on all no-knock warrants before they go to a judge. 'These changes, and more to come ... should signal that I hear the community and we will continue to make improvements anywhere that we can,' Fischer said. The three narcotics detectives had a no-knock warrant when they busted down the door of Taylor's apartment after midnight on March 13. They were investigating a drug dealer named Jamarcus Glover, who was arrested elsewhere the same day. Police said Glover was using Taylor's address to receive packages they believed could be drugs. No drugs were found at her apartment. Tom Wine, the city's top criminal prosecutor, said he believes police knocked and announced their presence. ""Simply because the police get a no-knock warrant does not mean they can't knock and announce,' Wine said last week. But the lawsuit filed on behalf of Taylor's mother says neighbors didn't hear the plainclothes detectives knock or identify themselves as officers before they crashed into the apartment. Taylor's boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, told investigators that he thought he was being robbed or that it might be an ex-boyfriend of Taylor's trying to get in. Walker told police he heard knocking but didn't know who it was. He said he and Taylor were moving toward the door when it was knocked down, so he fired a shot that hit an officer. Authorities had charged Walker with attempted murder but dropped the case last week. Wine said he wanted to let state and federal authorities complete their review of the shooting. Meanwhile, the American Civil Liberties Union of Kentucky has urged city leaders to ban no-knock warrants, saying they lead to the deaths of innocent people. A 2014 ACLU report on police militarization detailed several botched SWAT team raids as no-knock warrants were served, including one that year in Georgia that ended with a toddler in a medically induced coma. More recently, police in Montgomery County, Maryland, shot and killed 21-year-old Duncan Lemp in his family's home while serving a no-knock search warrant. An eyewitness said Lemp was asleep in his bedroom when police opened fire from outside his house, according to an attorney for his family. Police said Lemp, who was white, was armed with a rifle and ignored commands. Lemp family attorney Rene Sandler said police began using no-knock warrants decades ago as a tool in the nation's war on drugs. They have become the 'norm' for many kinds of criminal cases, including non-violent offenses, she said. 'It's an abuse of authority across the board,' said Sandler, a former county prosecutor. Law enforcement consultant Melvin Tucker, who's been a police chief in four cities in the U.S. South, said the element of surprise afforded by no-knock warrants isn't always justified. 'If you're going in on a drug case where the quantity is so small that they could dispose of it by flushing it down the toilet, you probably shouldn't be there with a search warrant in the first place. It's not worthwhile,' said Tucker, who has been an expert witness in dozens of court cases. The number of no-knock warrants served during SWAT team deployments has grown from approximately 1,500 annually in the early 1980s to about 45,000 in 2010, according to Eastern Kentucky University professor Peter Kraska, an expert in police militarization. He said police are adept at working around restrictions and tailoring paperwork to suit the standards of judges issuing search warrants. 'Banning no-knock warrants, if any jurisdiction can pull that off, is an important step,' Kraska said. 'At the end of the day, banning them probably won't accomplish much in the real world. But getting them off the books on one level is important.' Kentucky has a 'stand your ground' law that gives residents the right to use deadly force against an intruder. Those laws generally haven't protected people who unwittingly shoot at officers entering their homes, but Walker's dropped charges suggests the circumstances of Taylor's death could be an 'ideologically compatible situation for the left and right,' Kraska said. 'These different groups that normally would be at odds with one another all agree on the inappropriateness of no-knock warrants,' he added. 'There's been a lot more political agreement that this is problematic.' ___ Kunzelman reported from Silver Spring, Maryland. Sainz reported from Memphis, Tennessee.",0.0

'After consultation with the California Highway Patrol and Office of Emergency Services, the decision was made this evening to advise all state departments with offices in downtown city areas to close tomorrow, and to notify staff of the decision,' said Amy Palmer, a spokeswoman for the state Government Operations Agency. The directive was sent Sunday evening and it was left up to officials at individual agencies to determine which buildings should be closed. A state Department of Justice memo sent to employees said the attorney general's offices in Sacramento, Oakland, San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego would be closed, though employees who can work from home should do so. 'Staff assigned to these offices should not report to work for any reason. Staff who are able to telework should continue to do so despite the office closures,' the memo said. ___ PORTLAND, Ore. "" Police in Portland deployed tear gas to disperse a large crowd downtown late Sunday night after authorities said projectiles were thrown at officers. Earlier, police said protesters smashed windows at the federal courthouse, and authorities on loudspeakers declared the gathering a civil disturbance. Thousands of people marched throughout Oregon's largest city on Sunday, the third day of George Floyd protests in Portland. For much of the afternoon and evening protesters were largely peaceful, but there were reports of increased violence directed at police into the night. ___ SEOUL, South Korea "" North Korea's official Rodong Sinmun newspaper on Monday reported the demonstrations across the United States in reaction to the death of George Floyd, saying protesters 'harshly condemned' a white police officer's 'lawless and brutal murder' of a black citizen. The article, published with photos, said hundreds of protesters gathered in front of the White House chanting 'No justice, no peace.' It also said there were demonstrations in Minneapolis, New York, Denver, Chicago, Los Angeles and Memphis and that the protests were expected to grow further. ___ Several thousand people marched Monday in New Zealand's largest city, Auckland, to protest George Floyd's death and show solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement. The protesters marched from Aotea Square to the U.S. consulate, where they kneeled. They held banners with slogans such as 'I can't breathe' and 'The Real Virus is Racism.' Hundreds more joined protests and vigils elsewhere in the country, on a day that was a public holiday. The protests were peaceful. Protesters said they were also standing up against police violence and racism in New Zealand. ___ CHARLOTTE, N.C. "" More than 15 people were arrested during protests in Charlotte on Sunday night, the city's police department said. Police said four demonstrators were arrested for assaulting officers, including one for hitting an officer with a rock. Three others were arrested on illegal weapon charges, police said. ___ KANSAS CITY, Missouri "" Shortly after local officials praised what had been a peaceful protest in Kansas City, Missouri, police fired tear gas into the crowd after some demonstrators began lobbing water bottles, law enforcement officials said. A large crowd had gathered at County Club plaza and police had allowed it to slowly dissipate after the city's 8 p.m. curfew took effect. But police used stronger tactics against the smaller crowd that remained when rocks and water bottles started flying and two television station news vehicles were smashed and set on fire. Police declared the scene an 'unlawful assembly' and said the area was clear of activity by midnight. ___ OLYMPIA, Wash. "" Washington Gov. Jay Inslee late Sunday ordered a statewide activation of the National Guard following vandalism and stealing in stores and shopping malls in multiple cities. Inslee had previously authorized 400 troops for Seattle and 200 for Bellevue. On Saturday night people smashed downtown Seattle store fronts and stole items from many businesses, tossing mannequins into the street. On Sunday there were break-ins and thefts in stores and shopping malls in Bellevue, Spokane, Tukwila and Renton. Inslee's activation means more troops will be used to help control unrest. 'We must not let these illegal and dangerous actions detract from the anger so many feel at the deep injustice laid so ugly and bare by the death of George Floyd,' Inslee said in a statement. 'But we also will not turn away from our responsibility to protect the residents of our state.' ___ WASHINGTON "" Break-ins and stealing were rampant in downtown Washington and elsewhere in the city as protests over George Floyd's death turned violent for a third straight night. Protesters broke into a branch of Capital Bank, and empty jewelry boxes could be seen scattered on the sidewalk outside a Mervis Diamonds store. After protesters broke into a La Colombe coffee shop, someone in the crowd yelled, 'What are you looting a coffee shop for? You're messing up the whole message."" ___ NEW YORK "" The mayor of New York City's own daughter is one of the nearly 790 people who have been arrested in the city since protests over the death of George Floyd began last week. A law enforcement official who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter tells The Associated Press that 25-year-old Chiara de Blasio was arrested Saturday night. An arrest report obtained by The New York Post says she refused to leave a Manhattan street ordered cleared by officers because people were throwing things. Chiara de Blasio, who is black, was later given a court summons and released. Mayor Bill de Blasio, who is white, didn't mention the arrest in his Sunday press briefing. City Hall spokespeople didn't have an immediate comment. "" By Michael R. Sisak ___ AUSTIN, Texas "" Police fired rubber bullets and pepper spray late Sunday night at demonstrators who gathered outside the downtown police station in Austin. Live television cameras on Spectrum News showed officers firing several shots into the crowd and several people on the ground. Some people could be seen throwing water bottles at police. The officers were stationed above the crowd on the steps of the police station and a raised section of Interstate 35. Unlike Dallas, where police made dozens of arrests to enforce a downtown curfew, Austin doesn't have a curfew and demonstrators have been roaming downtown from the police station to the state Capitol several blocks away for nearly 10 hours. The crowd has ebbed and flowed from a few thousand to a few hundred. Demonstrators could not get on the Capitol grounds, which were protected by a large police presence. ___ DENVER "" Police fired tear gas and projectiles at demonstrators defying a Denver curfew Sunday night following a day of peaceful marching and chants of 'Don't shoot' alongside boarded-up businesses that had been vandalized the night before. Dozens of demonstrators, some throwing fireworks, taunted police and pushed dumpsters onto Colfax Avenue, a major artery, in the sporadic confrontations that occurred east of downtown. The demonstration over the death of George Floyd came after turbulent protests that led to the arrest of 83 people Saturday night. Denver Mayor Michael Hancock called the behavior of unruly protesters 'reckless, inexcusable and unacceptable.' ___ PHOENIX "" Protests held Sunday night in downtown Phoenix appeared to be peaceful, according to local media reports. An hour before a curfew went into effect, activist Armonee Jackson told protesters in the parking lot of an art gallery downtown that they should avoid any violence, The Arizona Republic reported. 'Listen to me: We are not ending in violence. I refuse to end in violence,' Jackson told the crowd. David Riutta told the newspaper that he came out to protest police brutality and wants to see a panel of civilians investigate officers' use-of-force cases. ___ WASHINGTON "" As demonstrations continued past an 11 p.m. curfew, D.C. police said they were responding to multiple fires that were 'intentionally set' around the city. One was at St. John's Episcopal Church, which is located across Lafayette Park from the White House. The church says every president beginning with James Madison, 'until the present,' has attended a service at the church, giving it the nickname, 'the church of presidents.' The first services at the church were held in 1816, according to its website. ___ WASHINGTON "" The entire Washington, D.C., National Guard "" roughly 1,700 soldiers "" is being called in to help with the response to protests outside the White House and elsewhere in the nation's capital, according to two Defense Department officials. Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser said Sunday she had requested 500 Guardsman to assist local law enforcement. Later on Sunday, as the protests escalated, Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy ordered the rest of the Guardsman "" about 1,200 soldiers "" to report. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the matter. The D.C. National Guard did not reply to a request from The Associated Press for comment. - By James LaPorta ___ WASHINGTON "" Protesters started fires near the White House as tensions with police mounted during a third straight night of demonstrations held in response to the death of George Floyd at police hands in Minnesota. An hour before the 11 p.m. curfew, police fired a major barrage of tear gas stun grenades into the crowd of more than 1,000 people, largely clearing Lafayette Park across the street from the White House and scattering protesters into the street. Protesters piled up road signs and plastic barriers and lit a raging fire in the middle of H Street. Some pulled an American flag from a nearby building and threw it into the blaze. Others added branches pulled from trees. A cinder block structure, on the north side of the park, that had bathrooms and a maintenance office, was engulfed in flames. As the curfew hit, police sealed the perimeter of the park. Shortly beforehand, police pushed a crowd of about 300 demonstrators several blocks with a series of charges with batons and riot shields. Enraged protesters screamed, 'Who do you serve? Who do you protect?' Police shot pepper powders point black at several protesters. Several miles north, a separate protest broke out in Northwest D.C., near the Maryland border. The Metropolitan Police Department says there were break-ins at a Target and a shopping center that houses Neiman Marcus, Saks Fifth Avenue Men's Store, T.J. Maxx, a movie theater and specialty stores. Police say several individuals have been detained. ___ At least 4,100 people have been arrested over days of protests across the country since George Floyd's death Monday, according to a tally compiled by The Associated Press. Arrests ranged from thefts to blocking highways and breaking curfew. The arrest figures as of 11 p.m. EST on Sunday included those from demonstrations in New York and Philadelphia on the East Coast, Chicago and Dallas in the Midwest and Southwest, and Los Angeles on the West Coast as protests take place all over the county. In Dallas, police began sweeping downtown streets with arrests to enforce a curfew that went into effect at 7 p.m. ___ CHARLOTTE, N.C. "" Michael Jordan is 'deeply saddened, truly pained and plain angry.' With protesters taking to the streets across the United States again Sunday, Jordan released a statement on George Floyd and the killings of black people at the hands of police. 'I am deeply saddened, truly pained and plain angry,' the former NBA star and current Charlotte Hornets owner said in the statement posted on the Jordan brand's social media accounts and the team's Twitter account. 'I see and feel everyone's pain, outrage and frustration. I stand with those who are calling out the ingrained racism and violence toward people of color in our country. We have had enough. 'I don't have the answers, but our collective voices show strength and the inability to be divided by others. We must listen to each other, show compassion and empathy and never turn our backs on senseless brutality. We need to continue peaceful expressions against injustice and demand accountability. Our unified voice needs to put pressure on our leaders to change our laws, or else we need to use our vote to create systemic change. Every one of us needs to be part of the solution, and we must work together to ensure justice for all. 'My heart goes out to the family of George Floyd and to the countless others whose lives have been brutally and senselessly taken through acts of racism and injustice.' ___ BOSTON "" A Sunday afternoon of mostly peaceful protests in Boston broke at nightfall when demonstrators clashed with officers, throwing rocks, breaking into several stores and lighting a police vehicle on fire. Boston police tweeted that at least 40 people had been arrested as of 3 a.m. Monday. Police said seven police officers had been hospitalized and 21 police cruisers were damaged. A National Guard unit was called in to help quell the unrest. Republican Gov. Charlie Baker called the violence 'criminal and cowardly' in a tweet. The nighttime destruction was a stark contrast to the several protests earlier Sunday that featured thousands of demonstrators marching peacefully. ___ ATLANTA "" Riot police firing volleys of tear gas dispersed hundreds of demonstrators as a curfew took hold Sunday night, scattering a crowd that had protested for hours in downtown Atlanta over the deaths of George Floyd in Minnesota and Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia. Hundreds of police, National Guard troops and other forces lined up in positions around downtown Centennial Park, a focal point of the weekend of protests. An overnight curfew took hold at 9 p.m. as some on the fringes of what was a largely peaceful afternoon protest were setting off fireworks and burning construction materials near the park. An Associated Press photographer saw police then begin firing many 40 millimeter canisters of tear gas toward the crowd. People were choking, gasping and some throwing up as they scattered, leaving only a few still in the streets. As police and National Guard troops took up positions with plastic shields on major streets, crowds melted away. WSB-TV showed footage about an hour later of officers taking people who lingered in the streets into custody, using plastic ties to handcuff them on street corners. ___ WASHINGTON "" Secret Service agents rushed President Donald Trump to an underground bunker Friday, as hundreds of protesters gathered outside the White House, some throwing rocks and tugging at police barricades just outside the executive mansion. That's according to a Republican close to the White House not authorized to publicly discuss private matters and confirmed by another official. The abrupt decision by the agents underscored the rattled mood inside the White House, where the chants from Lafayette Park could be heard all weekend and Secret Service agents and law enforcement officers struggled to contain the crowds. The Friday protests, triggered by the death of George Floyd, a black man who died after he was pinned at the neck by a white Minneapolis police officer, turned violent and appeared to catch officers by surprise. It sparked one of the highest alerts on the White House complex since the Sept. 11 attacks in 2001. In the days since, security at the White House has been reinforced by the National Guard and additional personnel from the Secret Service and the U.S. Park Police. On Sunday, the Justice Department also deployed members of the U.S. Marshals Service and agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration to supplement national guard troops outside the White House, according to a senior Justice Department official. The official could not discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. "" By Jonathan Lemire and Zeke Miller",0.0
1622019761,2020-06-01 01:25:19,Civil unrest could influence Biden's search for running mate,https://www.providencejournal.com/ZZ/news/20200601/civil-unrest-could-influence-bidens-search-for-running-mate?rssfeed=true,en,True,,68874,providencejournal.com,http://www.providencejournal.com/#spider,"WASHINGTON (AP) "" Joe Biden's search for a running mate could be reshaped by the police killing of George Floyd and the unrest it has ignited across the country, raising questions about contenders with law-and-order backgrounds and intensifying pressure on the presumptive Democratic nominee to select a black woman. Biden, who has already pledged to pick a woman, has cast a wide net in his search. Some of the women on his list have drawn national praise amid the protests over Floyd's death, including Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, who delivered an impassioned appeal for calm in her city on Friday night. But the outcry over police brutality against minorities has complicated the prospects of Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who had a controversial record addressing police violence as a prosecutor in the city where Floyd died. Biden's choice of a running mate will be among the most consequential decisions he makes in the campaign, particularly given that the 77-year-old is already talking about himself as a 'transition' candidate to a new generation of Democratic leaders. His pick will also be viewed as a signal both of his values and who he believes should have representation at the highest level of the American government. Even before the outcry over Floyd's death, some Biden allies were already urging him to put a black woman on the ticket given the critical role African Americans played in his path to the Democratic nomination. Those calls have gotten louder in recent days. 'The more we see this level of hatred, the more I think it's important to confront it with symbolic acts, including potentially the selection of an African American woman as vice president,' said Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers and one of the labor leaders who's been asked for input by Biden's team on the selection process. Biden was pressed to pick a black woman on Monday when he visited a black church in Wilmington, Delaware. ""A black female will overwhelm and excite and turn the heads of these young people and everybody out there,' an attendee told Biden, referring to those demonstrating in the streets. Beyond Bottoms, Biden is believed to be considering California Sen. Kamala Harris, Florida Rep. Val Demings and Stacey Abrams, the Georgia Democrat and voting rights activist. In an interview Sunday with The Associated Press, Demings didn't answer directly when asked if the events of the past week increased pressure on Biden to choose a black woman. 'Well, we've never seen a black woman selected as a vice presidential candidate,' she said. ""But I think the American people want someone who cares about their issues and are willing to move the ball forward."" Politicians with law-and-order backgrounds have been viewed skeptically by some in the Democratic Party given the high-profile instances of police brutality against minorities and other inequities in the criminal justice system. Demings, a former Orlando police chief, defended herself and other potential contenders with such backgrounds, declaring 'you're either gonna be part of the problem or part of the solution.' ""The community wants people who understand the system from the inside out in order to bring real life necessary reforms,' she said. Harris faced criticism throughout her Democratic primary campaign for her record as a prosecutor and attorney general in California, when she resisted reforms that would have required her office to investigate killings by police and established statewide standards for body cameras. Former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid suggested a resume as a prosecutor could be problematic for potential contenders. 'Prosecutors are not very popular, especially among young people now,' he said. 'I've got a granddaughter who is graduating from law school and she wants to be a public defender. She doesn't want to be a prosecutor. And I think a lot of younger people feel the same.' Klobuchar, who also sought the Democratic nomination, has faced questions about her eight years as prosecutor for Minnesota's largest county during the primary. Most of the more than two dozen people who died during police encounters in her tenure were people of color, according to data compiled by Communities United Against Police Brutality and news articles reviewed by the AP. An officer involved in one of those past fatal incidents was Derek Chauvin, who was arrested and charged Friday with Floyd's murder. Since ending her campaign, Klobuchar has emerged as a key Biden surrogate and some Democrats see her as a running mate who could help him appeal to some of the white, working-class voters who turned against the party in the 2016 election. Yet some Democrats say the renewed focus on police brutality could complicate her path. 'This is very tough timing for her,' said Rep. James Clyburn, D-S.C., a top Biden ally. Klobuchar has said that she is confident Biden will make the right choice and that she's not thinking about politics right now. Biden has said he will announce a running mate by Aug. 1, a timeline that leaves plenty of time for the national mood to shift again, particularly as the coronavirus pandemic and resulting economic collapse pressed on. Biden's search process is still in a relatively early phase. A search committee has been meeting with power players on the left, with special attention to Democratic leaders on Capitol Hill and across organized labor. Biden, who has largely been cloistered at his home in Delaware during the pandemic, would also like to conduct in person meetings with finalists. 'It's important for him to see the candidate, talk to the candidate, get body language from the candidate. And I don't mean one time. I think it needs to be several times,' said Cedric Richmond, a Louisiana congressman and campaign co-chair. __ Barrow reported from Atlanta.

(AP) "" Joe Biden vowed to address institutional racism in his first 100 days in office as he sought to elevate his voice Monday in the exploding national debate over racism and police brutality. The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee offered emotional support and promised bold action during an in-person discussion with black leaders in Delaware and a subsequent virtual meeting with big-city mayors who are grappling with racial tensions and frustrated by a lack of federal support. 'Hate just hides. It doesn't go away, and when you have somebody in power who breathes oxygen into the hate under the rocks, it comes out from under the rocks,' Biden told more than a dozen African American leaders gathered at a church in downtown Wilmington, his face mask lowered around his chin as he spoke. Without offering specifics, he promised to 'deal with institutional racism' and set up a police oversight body in his first 100 days in office, if elected. The former vice president also said he'd be releasing an economic plan focused on education, housing and 'access to capital"" and investments, especially for minority Americans, later this month. 'I really do believe that the blinders have been taken off. I think this tidal wave is moving,' Biden told the mayors of Atlanta, Chicago, Los Angeles and St. Paul, Minnesota. 'I realize we've got to do something big, we can do it, and everyone will benefit from it.' Largely sheltering in place amid the coronavirus, Biden has struggled in recent weeks to be heard from his makeshift home TV studio over the noise of dueling national crises. But after another night of violent protests, he ventured out into public for the second time in two days and just the third time since the pandemic arrived in mid-March. His hopeful and collaborative approach marked a sharp contrast to that of President Donald Trump, who has made little effort to unify the country. The Republican president slammed governors as 'weak' during a video teleconference on Monday and demanded tougher crackdowns on protesters. Trump also lashed out at Biden on Twitter, writing that 'Sleepy Joe Biden's people are so Radical Left that they are working to get the Anarchists out of jail, and probably more.' Biden's softer style may foreshadow how he presents himself in the five months before the presidential election, emphasizing calm and competence as a contrast to a mercurial president. It is an approach that carries the risk of being drowned out by Trump's much louder voice. On Monday evening, Trump declared himself 'the president of law and order' from the White House as military police and law enforcement fired tear gas and cleared protesters from nearby Lafayette Park. Biden made no mention of the unfolding events during an online fundraiser that took place at the same time, though he talked at length about persistent racism in the U.S. He plans to deliver remarks on the unrest gripping the U.S. on Tuesday in Philadelphia. In the early moments of Monday's gathering at the Bethel AME church in Wilmington, Biden listened quietly and took notes. All the attendees, including Biden, wore face masks but lowered them as they spoke. 'The vice president came to hear from us. This is a homeboy,' pastor Sylvester Beaman said before everyone bowed their heads in prayer. Biden's standing with the black community weighs heavily as he works to deny Trump a second term. African Americans rescued Biden's flailing primary campaign, but it's unclear if they will turn out for him in large numbers in November. 'I want to make something clear. I don't expect anything from the black community,"" Biden said Monday, insisting he has never taken its support for granted. The former vice president has been doing cleanup since telling a prominent black radio host a week and a half ago that African Americans who back Trump 'ain't black.' Yet the mayors who spoke with Biden, three of whom are black, were clearly frustrated and angry with Trump, who has offered military support to address violent protests while denying them federal support to address the coronavirus fallout and repeatedly attacking them on social media. 'To see the president of the United States say that he's going to send the military into our communities but hadn't mentioned sending a single dime of support into our communities, speaks to where we are in America,' said Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms. Much of Biden's campaign strategy centers on trying to draw a contrast with Trump on temperament and values. He has called the White House contest a battle for the soul of the nation and has been particularly forceful in condemning Trump's handling of moments of racial tension. In an election that is likely to be a referendum on the sitting president, some Biden aides say privately that the best plan may be to let Trump do himself in. Yet there is also a recognition that Biden needs to do more than simply wait for voters who may be turned off by Trump to turn toward him. Some Democrats who have criticized Biden for not being more visible during the onset of the coronavirus said he is making the right moves now. 'I'm sure they have some reluctance, understandably, right now to politicize it. That's not who he is,"" said Democratic strategist James Carville. 'There might be a time for eloquence, but I think that simplicity is eloquence right now.' ___ Jaffe reported from Washington; Peoples reported from Montclair, New Jersey.

'After consultation with the California Highway Patrol and Office of Emergency Services, the decision was made this evening to advise all state departments with offices in downtown city areas to close tomorrow, and to notify staff of the decision,' said Amy Palmer, a spokeswoman for the state Government Operations Agency. The directive was sent Sunday evening and it was left up to officials at individual agencies to determine which buildings should be closed. A state Department of Justice memo sent to employees said the attorney general's offices in Sacramento, Oakland, San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego would be closed, though employees who can work from home should do so. 'Staff assigned to these offices should not report to work for any reason. Staff who are able to telework should continue to do so despite the office closures,' the memo said. ___ PORTLAND, Ore. "" Police in Portland deployed tear gas to disperse a large crowd downtown late Sunday night after authorities said projectiles were thrown at officers. Earlier, police said protesters smashed windows at the federal courthouse, and authorities on loudspeakers declared the gathering a civil disturbance. Thousands of people marched throughout Oregon's largest city on Sunday, the third day of George Floyd protests in Portland. For much of the afternoon and evening protesters were largely peaceful, but there were reports of increased violence directed at police into the night. ___ SEOUL, South Korea "" North Korea's official Rodong Sinmun newspaper on Monday reported the demonstrations across the United States in reaction to the death of George Floyd, saying protesters 'harshly condemned' a white police officer's 'lawless and brutal murder' of a black citizen. The article, published with photos, said hundreds of protesters gathered in front of the White House chanting 'No justice, no peace.' It also said there were demonstrations in Minneapolis, New York, Denver, Chicago, Los Angeles and Memphis and that the protests were expected to grow further. ___ Several thousand people marched Monday in New Zealand's largest city, Auckland, to protest George Floyd's death and show solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement. The protesters marched from Aotea Square to the U.S. consulate, where they kneeled. They held banners with slogans such as 'I can't breathe' and 'The Real Virus is Racism.' Hundreds more joined protests and vigils elsewhere in the country, on a day that was a public holiday. The protests were peaceful. Protesters said they were also standing up against police violence and racism in New Zealand. ___ CHARLOTTE, N.C. "" More than 15 people were arrested during protests in Charlotte on Sunday night, the city's police department said. Police said four demonstrators were arrested for assaulting officers, including one for hitting an officer with a rock. Three others were arrested on illegal weapon charges, police said. ___ KANSAS CITY, Missouri "" Shortly after local officials praised what had been a peaceful protest in Kansas City, Missouri, police fired tear gas into the crowd after some demonstrators began lobbing water bottles, law enforcement officials said. A large crowd had gathered at County Club plaza and police had allowed it to slowly dissipate after the city's 8 p.m. curfew took effect. But police used stronger tactics against the smaller crowd that remained when rocks and water bottles started flying and two television station news vehicles were smashed and set on fire. Police declared the scene an 'unlawful assembly' and said the area was clear of activity by midnight. ___ OLYMPIA, Wash. "" Washington Gov. Jay Inslee late Sunday ordered a statewide activation of the National Guard following vandalism and stealing in stores and shopping malls in multiple cities. Inslee had previously authorized 400 troops for Seattle and 200 for Bellevue. On Saturday night people smashed downtown Seattle store fronts and stole items from many businesses, tossing mannequins into the street. On Sunday there were break-ins and thefts in stores and shopping malls in Bellevue, Spokane, Tukwila and Renton. Inslee's activation means more troops will be used to help control unrest. 'We must not let these illegal and dangerous actions detract from the anger so many feel at the deep injustice laid so ugly and bare by the death of George Floyd,' Inslee said in a statement. 'But we also will not turn away from our responsibility to protect the residents of our state.' ___ WASHINGTON "" Break-ins and stealing were rampant in downtown Washington and elsewhere in the city as protests over George Floyd's death turned violent for a third straight night. Protesters broke into a branch of Capital Bank, and empty jewelry boxes could be seen scattered on the sidewalk outside a Mervis Diamonds store. After protesters broke into a La Colombe coffee shop, someone in the crowd yelled, 'What are you looting a coffee shop for? You're messing up the whole message."" ___ NEW YORK "" The mayor of New York City's own daughter is one of the nearly 790 people who have been arrested in the city since protests over the death of George Floyd began last week. A law enforcement official who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter tells The Associated Press that 25-year-old Chiara de Blasio was arrested Saturday night. An arrest report obtained by The New York Post says she refused to leave a Manhattan street ordered cleared by officers because people were throwing things. Chiara de Blasio, who is black, was later given a court summons and released. Mayor Bill de Blasio, who is white, didn't mention the arrest in his Sunday press briefing. City Hall spokespeople didn't have an immediate comment. "" By Michael R. Sisak ___ AUSTIN, Texas "" Police fired rubber bullets and pepper spray late Sunday night at demonstrators who gathered outside the downtown police station in Austin. Live television cameras on Spectrum News showed officers firing several shots into the crowd and several people on the ground. Some people could be seen throwing water bottles at police. The officers were stationed above the crowd on the steps of the police station and a raised section of Interstate 35. Unlike Dallas, where police made dozens of arrests to enforce a downtown curfew, Austin doesn't have a curfew and demonstrators have been roaming downtown from the police station to the state Capitol several blocks away for nearly 10 hours. The crowd has ebbed and flowed from a few thousand to a few hundred. Demonstrators could not get on the Capitol grounds, which were protected by a large police presence. ___ DENVER "" Police fired tear gas and projectiles at demonstrators defying a Denver curfew Sunday night following a day of peaceful marching and chants of 'Don't shoot' alongside boarded-up businesses that had been vandalized the night before. Dozens of demonstrators, some throwing fireworks, taunted police and pushed dumpsters onto Colfax Avenue, a major artery, in the sporadic confrontations that occurred east of downtown. The demonstration over the death of George Floyd came after turbulent protests that led to the arrest of 83 people Saturday night. Denver Mayor Michael Hancock called the behavior of unruly protesters 'reckless, inexcusable and unacceptable.' ___ PHOENIX "" Protests held Sunday night in downtown Phoenix appeared to be peaceful, according to local media reports. An hour before a curfew went into effect, activist Armonee Jackson told protesters in the parking lot of an art gallery downtown that they should avoid any violence, The Arizona Republic reported. 'Listen to me: We are not ending in violence. I refuse to end in violence,' Jackson told the crowd. David Riutta told the newspaper that he came out to protest police brutality and wants to see a panel of civilians investigate officers' use-of-force cases. ___ WASHINGTON "" As demonstrations continued past an 11 p.m. curfew, D.C. police said they were responding to multiple fires that were 'intentionally set' around the city. One was at St. John's Episcopal Church, which is located across Lafayette Park from the White House. The church says every president beginning with James Madison, 'until the present,' has attended a service at the church, giving it the nickname, 'the church of presidents.' The first services at the church were held in 1816, according to its website. ___ WASHINGTON "" The entire Washington, D.C., National Guard "" roughly 1,700 soldiers "" is being called in to help with the response to protests outside the White House and elsewhere in the nation's capital, according to two Defense Department officials. Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser said Sunday she had requested 500 Guardsman to assist local law enforcement. Later on Sunday, as the protests escalated, Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy ordered the rest of the Guardsman "" about 1,200 soldiers "" to report. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the matter. The D.C. National Guard did not reply to a request from The Associated Press for comment. - By James LaPorta ___ WASHINGTON "" Protesters started fires near the White House as tensions with police mounted during a third straight night of demonstrations held in response to the death of George Floyd at police hands in Minnesota. An hour before the 11 p.m. curfew, police fired a major barrage of tear gas stun grenades into the crowd of more than 1,000 people, largely clearing Lafayette Park across the street from the White House and scattering protesters into the street. Protesters piled up road signs and plastic barriers and lit a raging fire in the middle of H Street. Some pulled an American flag from a nearby building and threw it into the blaze. Others added branches pulled from trees. A cinder block structure, on the north side of the park, that had bathrooms and a maintenance office, was engulfed in flames. As the curfew hit, police sealed the perimeter of the park. Shortly beforehand, police pushed a crowd of about 300 demonstrators several blocks with a series of charges with batons and riot shields. Enraged protesters screamed, 'Who do you serve? Who do you protect?' Police shot pepper powders point black at several protesters. Several miles north, a separate protest broke out in Northwest D.C., near the Maryland border. The Metropolitan Police Department says there were break-ins at a Target and a shopping center that houses Neiman Marcus, Saks Fifth Avenue Men's Store, T.J. Maxx, a movie theater and specialty stores. Police say several individuals have been detained. ___ At least 4,100 people have been arrested over days of protests across the country since George Floyd's death Monday, according to a tally compiled by The Associated Press. Arrests ranged from thefts to blocking highways and breaking curfew. The arrest figures as of 11 p.m. EST on Sunday included those from demonstrations in New York and Philadelphia on the East Coast, Chicago and Dallas in the Midwest and Southwest, and Los Angeles on the West Coast as protests take place all over the county. In Dallas, police began sweeping downtown streets with arrests to enforce a curfew that went into effect at 7 p.m. ___ CHARLOTTE, N.C. "" Michael Jordan is 'deeply saddened, truly pained and plain angry.' With protesters taking to the streets across the United States again Sunday, Jordan released a statement on George Floyd and the killings of black people at the hands of police. 'I am deeply saddened, truly pained and plain angry,' the former NBA star and current Charlotte Hornets owner said in the statement posted on the Jordan brand's social media accounts and the team's Twitter account. 'I see and feel everyone's pain, outrage and frustration. I stand with those who are calling out the ingrained racism and violence toward people of color in our country. We have had enough. 'I don't have the answers, but our collective voices show strength and the inability to be divided by others. We must listen to each other, show compassion and empathy and never turn our backs on senseless brutality. We need to continue peaceful expressions against injustice and demand accountability. Our unified voice needs to put pressure on our leaders to change our laws, or else we need to use our vote to create systemic change. Every one of us needs to be part of the solution, and we must work together to ensure justice for all. 'My heart goes out to the family of George Floyd and to the countless others whose lives have been brutally and senselessly taken through acts of racism and injustice.' ___ BOSTON "" A Sunday afternoon of mostly peaceful protests in Boston broke at nightfall when demonstrators clashed with officers, throwing rocks, breaking into several stores and lighting a police vehicle on fire. Boston police tweeted that at least 40 people had been arrested as of 3 a.m. Monday. Police said seven police officers had been hospitalized and 21 police cruisers were damaged. A National Guard unit was called in to help quell the unrest. Republican Gov. Charlie Baker called the violence 'criminal and cowardly' in a tweet. The nighttime destruction was a stark contrast to the several protests earlier Sunday that featured thousands of demonstrators marching peacefully. ___ ATLANTA "" Riot police firing volleys of tear gas dispersed hundreds of demonstrators as a curfew took hold Sunday night, scattering a crowd that had protested for hours in downtown Atlanta over the deaths of George Floyd in Minnesota and Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia. Hundreds of police, National Guard troops and other forces lined up in positions around downtown Centennial Park, a focal point of the weekend of protests. An overnight curfew took hold at 9 p.m. as some on the fringes of what was a largely peaceful afternoon protest were setting off fireworks and burning construction materials near the park. An Associated Press photographer saw police then begin firing many 40 millimeter canisters of tear gas toward the crowd. People were choking, gasping and some throwing up as they scattered, leaving only a few still in the streets. As police and National Guard troops took up positions with plastic shields on major streets, crowds melted away. WSB-TV showed footage about an hour later of officers taking people who lingered in the streets into custody, using plastic ties to handcuff them on street corners. ___ WASHINGTON "" Secret Service agents rushed President Donald Trump to an underground bunker Friday, as hundreds of protesters gathered outside the White House, some throwing rocks and tugging at police barricades just outside the executive mansion. That's according to a Republican close to the White House not authorized to publicly discuss private matters and confirmed by another official. The abrupt decision by the agents underscored the rattled mood inside the White House, where the chants from Lafayette Park could be heard all weekend and Secret Service agents and law enforcement officers struggled to contain the crowds. The Friday protests, triggered by the death of George Floyd, a black man who died after he was pinned at the neck by a white Minneapolis police officer, turned violent and appeared to catch officers by surprise. It sparked one of the highest alerts on the White House complex since the Sept. 11 attacks in 2001. In the days since, security at the White House has been reinforced by the National Guard and additional personnel from the Secret Service and the U.S. Park Police. On Sunday, the Justice Department also deployed members of the U.S. Marshals Service and agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration to supplement national guard troops outside the White House, according to a senior Justice Department official. The official could not discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. "" By Jonathan Lemire and Zeke Miller",0.0
1622039132,2020-06-01 01:25:19,Civil unrest could influence Biden's search for running mate,https://www.newportri.com/ZZ/news/20200601/civil-unrest-could-influence-bidens-search-for-running-mate?rssfeed=true,en,True,,662951,Newport Life,http://www.newportlifemagazine.com/,"WASHINGTON (AP) "" Joe Biden's search for a running mate could be reshaped by the police killing of George Floyd and the unrest it has ignited across the country, raising questions about contenders with law-and-order backgrounds and intensifying pressure on the presumptive Democratic nominee to select a black woman. Biden, who has already pledged to pick a woman, has cast a wide net in his search. Some of the women on his list have drawn national praise amid the protests over Floyd's death, including Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, who delivered an impassioned appeal for calm in her city on Friday night. But the outcry over police brutality against minorities has complicated the prospects of Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who had a controversial record addressing police violence as a prosecutor in the city where Floyd died. Biden's choice of a running mate will be among the most consequential decisions he makes in the campaign, particularly given that the 77-year-old is already talking about himself as a 'transition' candidate to a new generation of Democratic leaders. His pick will also be viewed as a signal both of his values and who he believes should have representation at the highest level of the American government. Even before the outcry over Floyd's death, some Biden allies were already urging him to put a black woman on the ticket given the critical role African Americans played in his path to the Democratic nomination. Those calls have gotten louder in recent days. 'The more we see this level of hatred, the more I think it's important to confront it with symbolic acts, including potentially the selection of an African American woman as vice president,' said Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers and one of the labor leaders who's been asked for input by Biden's team on the selection process. Biden was pressed to pick a black woman on Monday when he visited a black church in Wilmington, Delaware. ""A black female will overwhelm and excite and turn the heads of these young people and everybody out there,' an attendee told Biden, referring to those demonstrating in the streets. Beyond Bottoms, Biden is believed to be considering California Sen. Kamala Harris, Florida Rep. Val Demings and Stacey Abrams, the Georgia Democrat and voting rights activist. In an interview Sunday with The Associated Press, Demings didn't answer directly when asked if the events of the past week increased pressure on Biden to choose a black woman. 'Well, we've never seen a black woman selected as a vice presidential candidate,' she said. ""But I think the American people want someone who cares about their issues and are willing to move the ball forward."" Politicians with law-and-order backgrounds have been viewed skeptically by some in the Democratic Party given the high-profile instances of police brutality against minorities and other inequities in the criminal justice system. Demings, a former Orlando police chief, defended herself and other potential contenders with such backgrounds, declaring 'you're either gonna be part of the problem or part of the solution.' ""The community wants people who understand the system from the inside out in order to bring real life necessary reforms,' she said. Harris faced criticism throughout her Democratic primary campaign for her record as a prosecutor and attorney general in California, when she resisted reforms that would have required her office to investigate killings by police and established statewide standards for body cameras. Former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid suggested a resume as a prosecutor could be problematic for potential contenders. 'Prosecutors are not very popular, especially among young people now,' he said. 'I've got a granddaughter who is graduating from law school and she wants to be a public defender. She doesn't want to be a prosecutor. And I think a lot of younger people feel the same.' Klobuchar, who also sought the Democratic nomination, has faced questions about her eight years as prosecutor for Minnesota's largest county during the primary. Most of the more than two dozen people who died during police encounters in her tenure were people of color, according to data compiled by Communities United Against Police Brutality and news articles reviewed by the AP. An officer involved in one of those past fatal incidents was Derek Chauvin, who was arrested and charged Friday with Floyd's murder. Since ending her campaign, Klobuchar has emerged as a key Biden surrogate and some Democrats see her as a running mate who could help him appeal to some of the white, working-class voters who turned against the party in the 2016 election. Yet some Democrats say the renewed focus on police brutality could complicate her path. 'This is very tough timing for her,' said Rep. James Clyburn, D-S.C., a top Biden ally. Klobuchar has said that she is confident Biden will make the right choice and that she's not thinking about politics right now. Biden has said he will announce a running mate by Aug. 1, a timeline that leaves plenty of time for the national mood to shift again, particularly as the coronavirus pandemic and resulting economic collapse pressed on. Biden's search process is still in a relatively early phase. A search committee has been meeting with power players on the left, with special attention to Democratic leaders on Capitol Hill and across organized labor. Biden, who has largely been cloistered at his home in Delaware during the pandemic, would also like to conduct in person meetings with finalists. 'It's important for him to see the candidate, talk to the candidate, get body language from the candidate. And I don't mean one time. I think it needs to be several times,' said Cedric Richmond, a Louisiana congressman and campaign co-chair. __ Barrow reported from Atlanta.

Police say several individuals have been detained. ___ At least 4,100 people have been arrested over days of protests across the country since George Floyd's death Monday, according to a tally compiled by The Associated Press. Arrests ranged from thefts to blocking highways and breaking curfew. The arrest figures as of 11 p.m. EST on Sunday included those from demonstrations in New York and Philadelphia on the East Coast, Chicago and Dallas in the Midwest and Southwest, and Los Angeles on the West Coast as protests take place all over the county. In Dallas, police began sweeping downtown streets with arrests to enforce a curfew that went into effect at 7 p.m. ___ CHARLOTTE, N.C. "" Michael Jordan is 'deeply saddened, truly pained and plain angry.' With protesters taking to the streets across the United States again Sunday, Jordan released a statement on George Floyd and the killings of black people at the hands of police. 'I am deeply saddened, truly pained and plain angry,' the former NBA star and current Charlotte Hornets owner said in the statement posted on the Jordan brand's social media accounts and the team's Twitter account. 'I see and feel everyone's pain, outrage and frustration. I stand with those who are calling out the ingrained racism and violence toward people of color in our country. We have had enough. 'I don't have the answers, but our collective voices show strength and the inability to be divided by others. We must listen to each other, show compassion and empathy and never turn our backs on senseless brutality. We need to continue peaceful expressions against injustice and demand accountability. Our unified voice needs to put pressure on our leaders to change our laws, or else we need to use our vote to create systemic change. Every one of us needs to be part of the solution, and we must work together to ensure justice for all. 'My heart goes out to the family of George Floyd and to the countless others whose lives have been brutally and senselessly taken through acts of racism and injustice.' ___ BOSTON "" A Sunday afternoon of mostly peaceful protests in Boston broke at nightfall when demonstrators clashed with officers, throwing rocks, breaking into several stores and lighting a police vehicle on fire. Boston police tweeted that at least 40 people had been arrested as of 3 a.m. Monday. Police said seven police officers had been hospitalized and 21 police cruisers were damaged. A National Guard unit was called in to help quell the unrest. Republican Gov. Charlie Baker called the violence 'criminal and cowardly' in a tweet. The nighttime destruction was a stark contrast to the several protests earlier Sunday that featured thousands of demonstrators marching peacefully. ___ ATLANTA "" Riot police firing volleys of tear gas dispersed hundreds of demonstrators as a curfew took hold Sunday night, scattering a crowd that had protested for hours in downtown Atlanta over the deaths of George Floyd in Minnesota and Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia. Hundreds of police, National Guard troops and other forces lined up in positions around downtown Centennial Park, a focal point of the weekend of protests. An overnight curfew took hold at 9 p.m. as some on the fringes of what was a largely peaceful afternoon protest were setting off fireworks and burning construction materials near the park. An Associated Press photographer saw police then begin firing many 40 millimeter canisters of tear gas toward the crowd. People were choking, gasping and some throwing up as they scattered, leaving only a few still in the streets. As police and National Guard troops took up positions with plastic shields on major streets, crowds melted away. WSB-TV showed footage about an hour later of officers taking people who lingered in the streets into custody, using plastic ties to handcuff them on street corners. ___ WASHINGTON "" Secret Service agents rushed President Donald Trump to an underground bunker Friday, as hundreds of protesters gathered outside the White House, some throwing rocks and tugging at police barricades just outside the executive mansion. That's according to a Republican close to the White House not authorized to publicly discuss private matters and confirmed by another official. The abrupt decision by the agents underscored the rattled mood inside the White House, where the chants from Lafayette Park could be heard all weekend and Secret Service agents and law enforcement officers struggled to contain the crowds. The Friday protests, triggered by the death of George Floyd, a black man who died after he was pinned at the neck by a white Minneapolis police officer, turned violent and appeared to catch officers by surprise. It sparked one of the highest alerts on the White House complex since the Sept. 11 attacks in 2001. In the days since, security at the White House has been reinforced by the National Guard and additional personnel from the Secret Service and the U.S. Park Police. On Sunday, the Justice Department also deployed members of the U.S. Marshals Service and agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration to supplement national guard troops outside the White House, according to a senior Justice Department official. The official could not discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. "" By Jonathan Lemire and Zeke Miller",0.0
1622039360,2020-06-01 01:25:19,Civil unrest could influence Biden's search for running mate,https://www.newportri.com/ZZ/news/20200601/civil-unrest-could-influence-bidens-search-for-running-mate?rssfeed=true,en,True,,653261,Mercury - United States - Rhode Island,http://www.newportmercury.com/,"WASHINGTON (AP) "" Joe Biden's search for a running mate could be reshaped by the police killing of George Floyd and the unrest it has ignited across the country, raising questions about contenders with law-and-order backgrounds and intensifying pressure on the presumptive Democratic nominee to select a black woman. Biden, who has already pledged to pick a woman, has cast a wide net in his search. Some of the women on his list have drawn national praise amid the protests over Floyd's death, including Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, who delivered an impassioned appeal for calm in her city on Friday night. But the outcry over police brutality against minorities has complicated the prospects of Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who had a controversial record addressing police violence as a prosecutor in the city where Floyd died. Biden's choice of a running mate will be among the most consequential decisions he makes in the campaign, particularly given that the 77-year-old is already talking about himself as a 'transition' candidate to a new generation of Democratic leaders. His pick will also be viewed as a signal both of his values and who he believes should have representation at the highest level of the American government. Even before the outcry over Floyd's death, some Biden allies were already urging him to put a black woman on the ticket given the critical role African Americans played in his path to the Democratic nomination. Those calls have gotten louder in recent days. 'The more we see this level of hatred, the more I think it's important to confront it with symbolic acts, including potentially the selection of an African American woman as vice president,' said Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers and one of the labor leaders who's been asked for input by Biden's team on the selection process. Biden was pressed to pick a black woman on Monday when he visited a black church in Wilmington, Delaware. ""A black female will overwhelm and excite and turn the heads of these young people and everybody out there,' an attendee told Biden, referring to those demonstrating in the streets. Beyond Bottoms, Biden is believed to be considering California Sen. Kamala Harris, Florida Rep. Val Demings and Stacey Abrams, the Georgia Democrat and voting rights activist. In an interview Sunday with The Associated Press, Demings didn't answer directly when asked if the events of the past week increased pressure on Biden to choose a black woman. 'Well, we've never seen a black woman selected as a vice presidential candidate,' she said. ""But I think the American people want someone who cares about their issues and are willing to move the ball forward."" Politicians with law-and-order backgrounds have been viewed skeptically by some in the Democratic Party given the high-profile instances of police brutality against minorities and other inequities in the criminal justice system. Demings, a former Orlando police chief, defended herself and other potential contenders with such backgrounds, declaring 'you're either gonna be part of the problem or part of the solution.' ""The community wants people who understand the system from the inside out in order to bring real life necessary reforms,' she said. Harris faced criticism throughout her Democratic primary campaign for her record as a prosecutor and attorney general in California, when she resisted reforms that would have required her office to investigate killings by police and established statewide standards for body cameras. Former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid suggested a resume as a prosecutor could be problematic for potential contenders. 'Prosecutors are not very popular, especially among young people now,' he said. 'I've got a granddaughter who is graduating from law school and she wants to be a public defender. She doesn't want to be a prosecutor. And I think a lot of younger people feel the same.' Klobuchar, who also sought the Democratic nomination, has faced questions about her eight years as prosecutor for Minnesota's largest county during the primary. Most of the more than two dozen people who died during police encounters in her tenure were people of color, according to data compiled by Communities United Against Police Brutality and news articles reviewed by the AP. An officer involved in one of those past fatal incidents was Derek Chauvin, who was arrested and charged Friday with Floyd's murder. Since ending her campaign, Klobuchar has emerged as a key Biden surrogate and some Democrats see her as a running mate who could help him appeal to some of the white, working-class voters who turned against the party in the 2016 election. Yet some Democrats say the renewed focus on police brutality could complicate her path. 'This is very tough timing for her,' said Rep. James Clyburn, D-S.C., a top Biden ally. Klobuchar has said that she is confident Biden will make the right choice and that she's not thinking about politics right now. Biden has said he will announce a running mate by Aug. 1, a timeline that leaves plenty of time for the national mood to shift again, particularly as the coronavirus pandemic and resulting economic collapse pressed on. Biden's search process is still in a relatively early phase. A search committee has been meeting with power players on the left, with special attention to Democratic leaders on Capitol Hill and across organized labor. Biden, who has largely been cloistered at his home in Delaware during the pandemic, would also like to conduct in person meetings with finalists. 'It's important for him to see the candidate, talk to the candidate, get body language from the candidate. And I don't mean one time. I think it needs to be several times,' said Cedric Richmond, a Louisiana congressman and campaign co-chair. __ Barrow reported from Atlanta.

'After consultation with the California Highway Patrol and Office of Emergency Services, the decision was made this evening to advise all state departments with offices in downtown city areas to close tomorrow, and to notify staff of the decision,' said Amy Palmer, a spokeswoman for the state Government Operations Agency. The directive was sent Sunday evening and it was left up to officials at individual agencies to determine which buildings should be closed. A state Department of Justice memo sent to employees said the attorney general's offices in Sacramento, Oakland, San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego would be closed, though employees who can work from home should do so. 'Staff assigned to these offices should not report to work for any reason. Staff who are able to telework should continue to do so despite the office closures,' the memo said. ___ PORTLAND, Ore. "" Police in Portland deployed tear gas to disperse a large crowd downtown late Sunday night after authorities said projectiles were thrown at officers. Earlier, police said protesters smashed windows at the federal courthouse, and authorities on loudspeakers declared the gathering a civil disturbance. Thousands of people marched throughout Oregon's largest city on Sunday, the third day of George Floyd protests in Portland. For much of the afternoon and evening protesters were largely peaceful, but there were reports of increased violence directed at police into the night. ___ SEOUL, South Korea "" North Korea's official Rodong Sinmun newspaper on Monday reported the demonstrations across the United States in reaction to the death of George Floyd, saying protesters 'harshly condemned' a white police officer's 'lawless and brutal murder' of a black citizen. The article, published with photos, said hundreds of protesters gathered in front of the White House chanting 'No justice, no peace.' It also said there were demonstrations in Minneapolis, New York, Denver, Chicago, Los Angeles and Memphis and that the protests were expected to grow further. ___ Several thousand people marched Monday in New Zealand's largest city, Auckland, to protest George Floyd's death and show solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement. The protesters marched from Aotea Square to the U.S. consulate, where they kneeled. They held banners with slogans such as 'I can't breathe' and 'The Real Virus is Racism.' Hundreds more joined protests and vigils elsewhere in the country, on a day that was a public holiday. The protests were peaceful. Protesters said they were also standing up against police violence and racism in New Zealand. ___ CHARLOTTE, N.C. "" More than 15 people were arrested during protests in Charlotte on Sunday night, the city's police department said. Police said four demonstrators were arrested for assaulting officers, including one for hitting an officer with a rock. Three others were arrested on illegal weapon charges, police said. ___ KANSAS CITY, Missouri "" Shortly after local officials praised what had been a peaceful protest in Kansas City, Missouri, police fired tear gas into the crowd after some demonstrators began lobbing water bottles, law enforcement officials said. A large crowd had gathered at County Club plaza and police had allowed it to slowly dissipate after the city's 8 p.m. curfew took effect. But police used stronger tactics against the smaller crowd that remained when rocks and water bottles started flying and two television station news vehicles were smashed and set on fire. Police declared the scene an 'unlawful assembly' and said the area was clear of activity by midnight. ___ OLYMPIA, Wash. "" Washington Gov. Jay Inslee late Sunday ordered a statewide activation of the National Guard following vandalism and stealing in stores and shopping malls in multiple cities. Inslee had previously authorized 400 troops for Seattle and 200 for Bellevue. On Saturday night people smashed downtown Seattle store fronts and stole items from many businesses, tossing mannequins into the street. On Sunday there were break-ins and thefts in stores and shopping malls in Bellevue, Spokane, Tukwila and Renton. Inslee's activation means more troops will be used to help control unrest. 'We must not let these illegal and dangerous actions detract from the anger so many feel at the deep injustice laid so ugly and bare by the death of George Floyd,' Inslee said in a statement. 'But we also will not turn away from our responsibility to protect the residents of our state.' ___ WASHINGTON "" Break-ins and stealing were rampant in downtown Washington and elsewhere in the city as protests over George Floyd's death turned violent for a third straight night. Protesters broke into a branch of Capital Bank, and empty jewelry boxes could be seen scattered on the sidewalk outside a Mervis Diamonds store. After protesters broke into a La Colombe coffee shop, someone in the crowd yelled, 'What are you looting a coffee shop for? You're messing up the whole message."" ___ NEW YORK "" The mayor of New York City's own daughter is one of the nearly 790 people who have been arrested in the city since protests over the death of George Floyd began last week. A law enforcement official who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter tells The Associated Press that 25-year-old Chiara de Blasio was arrested Saturday night. An arrest report obtained by The New York Post says she refused to leave a Manhattan street ordered cleared by officers because people were throwing things. Chiara de Blasio, who is black, was later given a court summons and released. Mayor Bill de Blasio, who is white, didn't mention the arrest in his Sunday press briefing. City Hall spokespeople didn't have an immediate comment. "" By Michael R. Sisak ___ AUSTIN, Texas "" Police fired rubber bullets and pepper spray late Sunday night at demonstrators who gathered outside the downtown police station in Austin. Live television cameras on Spectrum News showed officers firing several shots into the crowd and several people on the ground. Some people could be seen throwing water bottles at police. The officers were stationed above the crowd on the steps of the police station and a raised section of Interstate 35. Unlike Dallas, where police made dozens of arrests to enforce a downtown curfew, Austin doesn't have a curfew and demonstrators have been roaming downtown from the police station to the state Capitol several blocks away for nearly 10 hours. The crowd has ebbed and flowed from a few thousand to a few hundred. Demonstrators could not get on the Capitol grounds, which were protected by a large police presence. ___ DENVER "" Police fired tear gas and projectiles at demonstrators defying a Denver curfew Sunday night following a day of peaceful marching and chants of 'Don't shoot' alongside boarded-up businesses that had been vandalized the night before. Dozens of demonstrators, some throwing fireworks, taunted police and pushed dumpsters onto Colfax Avenue, a major artery, in the sporadic confrontations that occurred east of downtown. The demonstration over the death of George Floyd came after turbulent protests that led to the arrest of 83 people Saturday night. Denver Mayor Michael Hancock called the behavior of unruly protesters 'reckless, inexcusable and unacceptable.' ___ PHOENIX "" Protests held Sunday night in downtown Phoenix appeared to be peaceful, according to local media reports. An hour before a curfew went into effect, activist Armonee Jackson told protesters in the parking lot of an art gallery downtown that they should avoid any violence, The Arizona Republic reported. 'Listen to me: We are not ending in violence. I refuse to end in violence,' Jackson told the crowd. David Riutta told the newspaper that he came out to protest police brutality and wants to see a panel of civilians investigate officers' use-of-force cases. ___ WASHINGTON "" As demonstrations continued past an 11 p.m. curfew, D.C. police said they were responding to multiple fires that were 'intentionally set' around the city. One was at St. John's Episcopal Church, which is located across Lafayette Park from the White House. The church says every president beginning with James Madison, 'until the present,' has attended a service at the church, giving it the nickname, 'the church of presidents.' The first services at the church were held in 1816, according to its website. ___ WASHINGTON "" The entire Washington, D.C., National Guard "" roughly 1,700 soldiers "" is being called in to help with the response to protests outside the White House and elsewhere in the nation's capital, according to two Defense Department officials. Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser said Sunday she had requested 500 Guardsman to assist local law enforcement. Later on Sunday, as the protests escalated, Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy ordered the rest of the Guardsman "" about 1,200 soldiers "" to report. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the matter. The D.C. National Guard did not reply to a request from The Associated Press for comment. - By James LaPorta ___ WASHINGTON "" Protesters started fires near the White House as tensions with police mounted during a third straight night of demonstrations held in response to the death of George Floyd at police hands in Minnesota. An hour before the 11 p.m. curfew, police fired a major barrage of tear gas stun grenades into the crowd of more than 1,000 people, largely clearing Lafayette Park across the street from the White House and scattering protesters into the street. Protesters piled up road signs and plastic barriers and lit a raging fire in the middle of H Street. Some pulled an American flag from a nearby building and threw it into the blaze. Others added branches pulled from trees. A cinder block structure, on the north side of the park, that had bathrooms and a maintenance office, was engulfed in flames. As the curfew hit, police sealed the perimeter of the park. Shortly beforehand, police pushed a crowd of about 300 demonstrators several blocks with a series of charges with batons and riot shields. Enraged protesters screamed, 'Who do you serve? Who do you protect?' Police shot pepper powders point black at several protesters. Several miles north, a separate protest broke out in Northwest D.C., near the Maryland border. The Metropolitan Police Department says there were break-ins at a Target and a shopping center that houses Neiman Marcus, Saks Fifth Avenue Men's Store, T.J. Maxx, a movie theater and specialty stores. Police say several individuals have been detained. ___ At least 4,100 people have been arrested over days of protests across the country since George Floyd's death Monday, according to a tally compiled by The Associated Press. Arrests ranged from thefts to blocking highways and breaking curfew. The arrest figures as of 11 p.m. EST on Sunday included those from demonstrations in New York and Philadelphia on the East Coast, Chicago and Dallas in the Midwest and Southwest, and Los Angeles on the West Coast as protests take place all over the county. In Dallas, police began sweeping downtown streets with arrests to enforce a curfew that went into effect at 7 p.m. ___ CHARLOTTE, N.C. "" Michael Jordan is 'deeply saddened, truly pained and plain angry.' With protesters taking to the streets across the United States again Sunday, Jordan released a statement on George Floyd and the killings of black people at the hands of police. 'I am deeply saddened, truly pained and plain angry,' the former NBA star and current Charlotte Hornets owner said in the statement posted on the Jordan brand's social media accounts and the team's Twitter account. 'I see and feel everyone's pain, outrage and frustration. I stand with those who are calling out the ingrained racism and violence toward people of color in our country. We have had enough.

Every one of us needs to be part of the solution, and we must work together to ensure justice for all. 'My heart goes out to the family of George Floyd and to the countless others whose lives have been brutally and senselessly taken through acts of racism and injustice.' ___ BOSTON "" A Sunday afternoon of mostly peaceful protests in Boston broke at nightfall when demonstrators clashed with officers, throwing rocks, breaking into several stores and lighting a police vehicle on fire. Boston police tweeted that at least 40 people had been arrested as of 3 a.m. Monday. Police said seven police officers had been hospitalized and 21 police cruisers were damaged. A National Guard unit was called in to help quell the unrest. Republican Gov. Charlie Baker called the violence 'criminal and cowardly' in a tweet.

(AP) "" Joe Biden vowed to address institutional racism in his first 100 days in office as he sought to elevate his voice Monday in the exploding national debate over racism and police brutality. The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee offered emotional support and promised bold action during an in-person discussion with black leaders in Delaware and a subsequent virtual meeting with big-city mayors who are grappling with racial tensions and frustrated by a lack of federal support. 'Hate just hides. It doesn't go away, and when you have somebody in power who breathes oxygen into the hate under the rocks, it comes out from under the rocks,' Biden told more than a dozen African American leaders gathered at a church in downtown Wilmington, his face mask lowered around his chin as he spoke. Without offering specifics, he promised to 'deal with institutional racism' and set up a police oversight body in his first 100 days in office, if elected. The former vice president also said he'd be releasing an economic plan focused on education, housing and 'access to capital"" and investments, especially for minority Americans, later this month. 'I really do believe that the blinders have been taken off. I think this tidal wave is moving,' Biden told the mayors of Atlanta, Chicago, Los Angeles and St. Paul, Minnesota. 'I realize we've got to do something big, we can do it, and everyone will benefit from it.' Largely sheltering in place amid the coronavirus, Biden has struggled in recent weeks to be heard from his makeshift home TV studio over the noise of dueling national crises. But after another night of violent protests, he ventured out into public for the second time in two days and just the third time since the pandemic arrived in mid-March. His hopeful and collaborative approach marked a sharp contrast to that of President Donald Trump, who has made little effort to unify the country. The Republican president slammed governors as 'weak' during a video teleconference on Monday and demanded tougher crackdowns on protesters. Trump also lashed out at Biden on Twitter, writing that 'Sleepy Joe Biden's people are so Radical Left that they are working to get the Anarchists out of jail, and probably more.' Biden's softer style may foreshadow how he presents himself in the five months before the presidential election, emphasizing calm and competence as a contrast to a mercurial president. It is an approach that carries the risk of being drowned out by Trump's much louder voice. On Monday evening, Trump declared himself 'the president of law and order' from the White House as military police and law enforcement fired tear gas and cleared protesters from nearby Lafayette Park. Biden made no mention of the unfolding events during an online fundraiser that took place at the same time, though he talked at length about persistent racism in the U.S. He plans to deliver remarks on the unrest gripping the U.S. on Tuesday in Philadelphia.

The former vice president has been doing cleanup since telling a prominent black radio host a week and a half ago that African Americans who back Trump 'ain't black.'

(AP) "" Joe Biden vowed to address institutional racism in his first 100 days in office as he sought to elevate his voice Monday in the exploding national debate over racism and police brutality. The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee offered emotional support and promised bold action during an in-person discussion with black leaders in Delaware and a subsequent virtual meeting with big-city mayors who are grappling with racial tensions and frustrated by a lack of federal support. 'Hate just hides. It doesn't go away, and when you have somebody in power who breathes oxygen into the hate under the rocks, it comes out from under the rocks,' Biden told more than a dozen African American leaders gathered at a church in downtown Wilmington, his face mask lowered around his chin as he spoke. Without offering specifics, he promised to 'deal with institutional racism' and set up a police oversight body in his first 100 days in office, if elected. The former vice president also said he'd be releasing an economic plan focused on education, housing and 'access to capital"" and investments, especially for minority Americans, later this month. 'I really do believe that the blinders have been taken off. I think this tidal wave is moving,' Biden told the mayors of Atlanta, Chicago, Los Angeles and St. Paul, Minnesota. 'I realize we've got to do something big, we can do it, and everyone will benefit from it.' Largely sheltering in place amid the coronavirus, Biden has struggled in recent weeks to be heard from his makeshift home TV studio over the noise of dueling national crises. But after another night of violent protests, he ventured out into public for the second time in two days and just the third time since the pandemic arrived in mid-March. His hopeful and collaborative approach marked a sharp contrast to that of President Donald Trump, who has made little effort to unify the country. The Republican president slammed governors as 'weak' during a video teleconference on Monday and demanded tougher crackdowns on protesters.

1622100877,2020-06-01 04:33:24,Use of force criticized in protests about police brutality,https://www.newportri.com/ZZ/news/20200601/use-of-force-criticized-in-protests-about-police-brutality?rssfeed=true,en,False,,662950,Newport Daily News,http://www.newportdailynews.com/ee/newportdailynews/index.php,"As protests grip the nation, officers have doused crowds with pepper spray, struck protesters with batons, steered police cars into throngs, shoved demonstrators and screamed curses. Some police action has been directed against people smashing windows, breaking into stores and burning cars, but many find other instances more difficult to understand "" like the elderly man knocked over by police as he walked with a cane on a Salt Lake City sidewalk. The protests began after the May 25 death of George Floyd, a black man who died in Minneapolis after a white police officer who is now charged with murder, Derek Chauvin, pressed his knee into Floyd's neck for several minutes even after he stopped moving and pleading for air. Now, some are questioning whether tough police tactics against demonstrators are actually making the violence worse rather than quelling it. While the protests and subsequent police interactions may be shocking to some, many African Americans aren't surprised because they've endured police brutality for decades, said Chris White, director of the Detroit Coalition Against Police Brutality, 'What's happening, it's the way American society has always been,' White said. U.S. Rep. Joyce Beatty, who was hit by pepper spray Saturday as scuffles broke out near the end of a demonstration in Columbus, Ohio, said police escalated matters by using heavy-handed tactics against 'passionate' young demonstrators who were mostly orderly. 'Too much force is not the answer to this,' said Beatty, who pressed for peaceful tactics on both sides in a video posted on Twitter by Columbus City Council president Shannon Hardin, who also was pepper-sprayed. Both are African American. In Salt Lake City, a police officer shoved and knocked over an older man who was walking with a cane on a sidewalk near a protest. Another officer stepped in within seconds to assist the man, as did the officer who knocked him down. Police Chief Mike Brown issued a video Sunday saying he'd personally apologized to the man. 'It was hard for me to watch what happened, and I know it was even harder for him to experience it,' Brown said. In New York, where video showed two police vehicles driving into a crowd, knocking aside demonstrators, Mayor Bill de Blasio decried what he called ""structural racism"" that leads to violence against minorities, but also defended police. 'It is inappropriate for protesters to surround a police vehicle and threaten police officers,' he said. 'That's wrong on its face and that hasn't happened in the history of protests in this city.' Two police officers in Atlanta were fired and three others placed on desk duty over excessive use of force during a protest incident involving two college students Saturday night. Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said Sunday that she and the police chief made the decision after reviewing body-camera footage. Footage shown on TV as captured by local reporters shows a group of police officers in riot gear and gas masks surround a car being driven by a man with a woman in the passenger seat. The officers pull the woman out and appear to use a stun gun on the man. They use zip-tie handcuffs on the woman on the ground. In a message some saw as encouraging police violence, President Donald Trump praised U.S. Secret Service officers guarding the White House amid demonstrations and said any protesters who breached its fence would face 'the most vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons, I have ever seen. That's when people would have been really badly hurt, at least.' In a letter titled 'Dear America,' civil rights leader Rev. William Barber II, a pastor at Greenleaf Christian Church in Goldsboro, North Carolina, said protesters have the right to decry 'brutal and inhumane' treatment at the hands of police. 'What if, instead of a President who tweets 'when the looting starts, the shooting starts,' we had leadership that could unequivocally say, 'When you use police power in the name of the state to murder, lynch, and destroy, you will be prosecuted for your crimes,'"" Barber wrote. Trump wasn't alone in using loaded language. The Minnesota Department of Public Safety sent a tweet Saturday saying it would strengthen its response to 'a sophisticated network of urban warfare.' Hours later, video emerged of police shooting paint projectiles at people gathered on the front porch of a home after curfew in Minneapolis. 'Light 'em up,' a man is heard saying before the shooting began. No one appeared seriously injured. Activist Meeko Williams organized a peaceful demonstration in Detroit on Friday and later traveled to Minnesota to help support organizers there. Trying to understand what he sees as increasingly aggressive law enforcement tactics, Williams said police shouldn't 'antagonize, provoke or instigate' protesters. 'I don't know what's going to happen over these next few days in this country because they want these killer cops arrested and they're not going to stop until they are,' Williams said, referring to the lack of charges against the other three officers at the scene when Floyd's neck was pinned under Chauvin's knee. 'People are just sick and tired of being in this predicament, where innocent life has been taken at the hands of those who were to protect and serve us. We have not been heard.' Some protesters are increasing efforts to protect themselves. On Sunday, Black Lives Matter organizers in Tampa, Florida, had nearly 100 safety marshals in fluorescent vests patrolling their march, trained in de-escalation tactics. The group also had medics and enlisted lawyers and those with legal training to watch out for protesters' rights from the sidelines. In New York, a police labor group, the Detectives' Endowment Association, noted some police there had been attacked and patrol cars set ablaze. 'As we do everything to stop NYC from burning, all we hear from elected officials is criticism,"" the group tweeted. 'Maybe they should try it on the front lines.' ___ Reeves and Stafford are members of the AP's Race and Ethnicity team. Reeves reported from Birmingham, Alabama, and Stafford from Detroit.",0.0

'If it's turned out that he acted inappropriately, then we will have swift discipline in response to what he did,"" Trantalis said. ""We do not appreciate that kind of conduct, nobody in the department wants to be disrespected, and we feel this should never have happened.' ___ NASHVILLE, Tenn. "" A man who set fire to a historic courthouse in Tennessee during weekend protests has been arrested. Wesley Somers, 25, is charged with felony arson, vandalism and disorderly conduct. He is accused of setting fire to Nashville's Historic Courthouse on Saturday night. Metro Nashville Police said Somers was among 29 people arrested after protesters in Tennessee's capital set fires inside and outside the courthouse and toppled a statue of a former state lawmaker and newspaper publisher who espoused racist views. Protesters damaged 30 businesses. In addition to the courthouse, the Ryman Auditorium, known as the mother church of country music, was damaged, police said. Others who were arrested face charges that include assaulting police officers, disorderly conduct and criminal trespassing, police said. It wasn't immediately clear whether Somers has an attorney. Separate demonstrations were held in Murfreesboro, Chattanooga, and Memphis, where protesters made it onto Interstate 55, circumventing officers in riot gear. ___ BERLIN "" Protests against the death of George Floyd continued for a third day in Berlin, though the gathering outside the U.S. embassy Monday was significantly smaller than earlier rallies. Police said about 1,500 people took part in a march Sunday in the German capital's hip Kreuzberg district, after about 2,000 people staged a protest in front of the embassy Saturday. Paul Schreiner, 69 and originally from Wisconsin, was among a dozen people holding a vigil outside the embassy Monday. 'It's my duty, I feel, to be here,' he said. 'There's a very interesting phrase that 'white silence is violence,' and that moved me to make sure I came today.' Holding a sign with the names of George Floyd, Trayvon Martin, Eric Garner and others, American citizen Carmen Osorio Rodrigues said she was concerned about the direction the United States is heading. 'We have to confront these social injustices,' she said, adding: 'We need clear leadership on how to act.' ___ WASHINGTON "" Evidence of the chaos that erupted around the White House was visible as people streamed to work Monday morning. Plywood covered the windows of several shuttered businesses along one heavily traveled street leading to the White House, but a McDonald's that Bill Clinton frequented as president remained open, albeit with plywood structures reinforcing its street-facing windows. Blocks away, the windows of a major bank branch had been shattered and its exterior scrawled with expletive-filled graffiti expressing displeasure with such institutions. ___ SAN FRANCISCO "" San Francisco police officers seized firearms and explosives and arrested at least 80 people Sunday night on violating a curfew and looting charges. San Francisco Police Chief Bill Scott said demonstrations that drew about 1,000 people carrying signs and chanting 'George Floyd' and 'Black lives matter' were overwhelmingly peaceful Sunday and the vast majority of demonstrators dispersed without incident before the 8 p.m. curfew. But a relatively small number of 'defiant individuals' who had gathered in the Civic Center area refused to disperse, threw bottles at officers and started trash fires, Scott said. In response, officers and deputies with the sheriff's office began making arrests, he said. ___ INDIANAPOLIS "" An overnight curfew imposed by Indianapolis' mayor after two nights of violent protest over the death of George Floyd and police treatment of African Americans was followed by a night of relative calm after a weekend that left the city with widespread damage downtown, a police spokesman said Monday. Officer William Young of the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department said the city 'was relatively quiet' during the overnight curfew, in comparison to violent weekend protests during which demonstrators broke dozens of windows on downtown businesses and set fires. He said police planned to release a tally later Monday of arrests that occurred during the curfew that ran from 8 p.m. Sunday until 6 a.m. Monday. Curfew violators were subject to arrest and fines. ___ MINNEAPOLIS "" The attorney for George Floyd's family was set to announce findings Monday of an independent autopsy into his death a week ago after a Minneapolis officer held his knee on Floyd's neck for several minutes. Floyd, a black man who was in handcuffs at the time, died after the white officer ignored bystander shouts to get off him and Floyd's cries that he couldn't breathe. His death, captured on citizen video, sparked days of protests in Minneapolis that have spread to cities around America. An official autopsy last week said the combined effects of being restrained, potential intoxicants in Floyd's system and his underlying health issues, including heart disease, likely contributed to his death. There were no other details about intoxicants, and toxicology results can take weeks. In the 911 call that drew police, the caller described the man suspected of paying with counterfeit money as 'awfully drunk and he's not in control of himself.' The criminal complaint noted that the medical examiner's report was preliminary, but said the autopsy 'revealed no physical findings that support a diagnosis of traumatic asphyxia or strangulation.' Ben Crump, the attorney representing Floyd's family, said last week that he was commissioning the family's own autopsy. ___ MADISON, Wisconsin "" Fifteen people were arrested after a second night of violence erupted Sunday night in Madison, Wisconsin, with police firing tear gas as protesters again threw rocks and damaged store downtown stores following an afternoon peaceful protest over the death of George Floyd. There were also protests in Milwaukee and Racine on Sunday night, continuing a weekend of unrest both in Wisconsin and across the country in reaction to Floyd's death. Madison police reported Monday that multiple stores were looted in the State Street area, a business corridor that connects the state Capitol to the University of Wisconsin campus. One of the 15 people arrested was armed with a handgun, police said. There were multiple unsuccessful attempts to steal a police squad car, the police said. A protest Sunday night in Milwaukee was mostly peaceful, but a crowd that gathered outside of a city police station was dispersed with tear gas. National Guard troops were deployed in both Madison and Milwaukee to assist local law enforcement. In Racine, about 150 people marched to the police station where they threw rocks at police who were wearing riot gear. The crowd dispersed after police fired tear gas. ___ MINNEAPOLIS "" Authorities say the driver of a semitrailer who rolled into the midst of thousands of people marching on a closed Minneapolis freeway over the death of George Floyd has been arrested on suspicion of assault. Authorities had said it appeared no one was hurt Sunday but some witnesses said a handful of people who were on Interstate 35W near downtown Minneapolis sought medical attention on their own. Authorities said they could not confirm that. The freeway was among many shut down in the Minneapolis area for the second night in a row as officials imposed an 8 p.m. curfew and sought to make it more difficult for protesters to move around. Bystander video showed the crowd parting seconds before the semi rolled through, then the tanker truck gradually slowed and demonstrators swarmed the truck. Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington said Sunday that it initially appeared from traffic camera footage that the semitrailer was already on the freeway before barricades were set up at 5 p.m. State Corrections Commissioner Paul Schnell said at a later briefing, however, that the truck went around a traffic barrier to stay on the road. ___ LONDON "" British Prime Minister Boris Johnson's spokesman says arrests and assaults on journalists covering protests in the United States are 'very concerning.' James Slack said Monday that 'journalists all around the world must be free to do their job and to hold authorities to account without fear of arrest or violence.' He said the violence of the past few nights was 'very alarming. People must be allowed to protest peacefully.' Slack said 'the footage of George Floyd's death was deeply distressing and our thoughts are with all those who have been affected.' Noting that a police officer has been charged with murder, he said 'we would hope and expect justice to be done.' ___ LOUISVILLE, Ky. "" The police chief of Louisville, Kentucky, says police officers and National Guard soldiers enforcing a curfew in Louisville killed a man early Monday when they returned fire after someone in a large group fired at them first. Louisville Metro Police Chief Steve Conrad confirmed the shooting happened around 12:15 a.m. outside a business on West Broadway, where police and the National Guard had been called to break up a large group of people gathering in defiance of the city's curfew. Someone fired a shot at them and the officers returned fire, the chief said. It was unclear if the person killed is the one who fired at the law enforcers, he said. Protests have erupted in Louisville over the shooting death of Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old EMT was shot eight times by narcotics detectives who knocked down her front door, as well as the death of George Floyd. ___ SIOUX FALLS, S.D. "" South Dakota Gov. Governor Kristi Noem activated the National Guard after protests in Sioux Fall turned violent over the death of George Floyd. The protest in South Dakota's largest city started Sunday afternoon with a march downtown. Police said dozens of protesters later congregated at the Empire Mall and began throwing rocks at officers and breaking windows. Police said protesters had dispersed by 11 p.m. Noem said about 70 Guard members are in Sioux Falls and will remain until they are no longer needed. ___ PARIS "" In France, family and friends of a French black man who died shortly after he was arrested by police in 2016 have called for a protest on Tuesday which will also pay homage to George Floyd. The circumstances of the death of Adama Traore, a French 24-old-man of Malian origin, are still under investigation by justice authorities. Calls for Tuesday's protest in front of the Paris court come after some medical experts last week attributed the death to a cardiac problem, the latest in a series of conflicting medical assessments. French police claimed Traore died of a heart attack due to pre-existing medical condition. His family said he died from asphyxiation from police tactics. In a video message published on social media, Traore's sister Assa Traore calls for protesters to express their indignation 'at a time when the world, when France is outraged by the death of George Floyd.' She said 'they had the same words, their last words: 'I can't breathe, I can't breathe.'"" She denounced the latest medical experts' report as 'racist' and 'untrue.' The family wants the officers in charge of Traore's arrest to go on trial. ___ ALBUQUERQUE, New Mexico "" A protest along the historic Route 66 into downtown Albuquerque turned violent early Monday after police reported demonstrators setting small fires and officers say they were fired upon. Albuquerque police spokesman Gilbert Gallegos says officers reported shots fired at them in front of the historic Kimo Theater early Monday after a mostly peaceful demonstration disbanded. Gallego said there was damage to several properties in the area, including broken windows and some stealing from stores. No injuries were reported. Before the chaos, hundreds of people on Sunday marched down historic Route 66, protesting the death of George Floyd. Protesters in New Mexico's largest city held signs, wore masks and chanted, 'Say his name: George Floyd' and 'Hands up, don't shoot.' Activist Arthur Bell told protesters there will be another demonstration Monday evening in front of Albuquerque Police Department headquarters, but that rally will be 'different.' When The Associated Press asked Bell what he meant by 'different,' he said: 'A general never gives out his tactics.'",0.0

Protesters damaged 30 businesses. In addition to the courthouse, the Ryman Auditorium, known as the mother church of country music, was damaged, police said. Others who were arrested face charges that include assaulting police officers, disorderly conduct and criminal trespassing, police said. It wasn't immediately clear whether Somers has an attorney. Separate demonstrations were held in Murfreesboro, Chattanooga, and Memphis, where protesters made it onto Interstate 55, circumventing officers in riot gear. ___ BERLIN "" Protests against the death of George Floyd continued for a third day in Berlin, though the gathering outside the U.S. embassy Monday was significantly smaller than earlier rallies. Police said about 1,500 people took part in a march Sunday in the German capital's hip Kreuzberg district, after about 2,000 people staged a protest in front of the embassy Saturday. Paul Schreiner, 69 and originally from Wisconsin, was among a dozen people holding a vigil outside the embassy Monday. 'It's my duty, I feel, to be here,' he said. 'There's a very interesting phrase that 'white silence is violence,' and that moved me to make sure I came today.' Holding a sign with the names of George Floyd, Trayvon Martin, Eric Garner and others, American citizen Carmen Osorio Rodrigues said she was concerned about the direction the United States is heading. 'We have to confront these social injustices,' she said, adding: 'We need clear leadership on how to act.' ___ WASHINGTON "" Evidence of the chaos that erupted around the White House was visible as people streamed to work Monday morning. Plywood covered the windows of several shuttered businesses along one heavily traveled street leading to the White House, but a McDonald's that Bill Clinton frequented as president remained open, albeit with plywood structures reinforcing its street-facing windows. Blocks away, the windows of a major bank branch had been shattered and its exterior scrawled with expletive-filled graffiti expressing displeasure with such institutions. ___ SAN FRANCISCO "" San Francisco police officers seized firearms and explosives and arrested at least 80 people Sunday night on violating a curfew and looting charges. San Francisco Police Chief Bill Scott said demonstrations that drew about 1,000 people carrying signs and chanting 'George Floyd' and 'Black lives matter' were overwhelmingly peaceful Sunday and the vast majority of demonstrators dispersed without incident before the 8 p.m. curfew. But a relatively small number of 'defiant individuals' who had gathered in the Civic Center area refused to disperse, threw bottles at officers and started trash fires, Scott said. In response, officers and deputies with the sheriff's office began making arrests, he said. ___ INDIANAPOLIS "" An overnight curfew imposed by Indianapolis' mayor after two nights of violent protest over the death of George Floyd and police treatment of African Americans was followed by a night of relative calm after a weekend that left the city with widespread damage downtown, a police spokesman said Monday. Officer William Young of the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department said the city 'was relatively quiet' during the overnight curfew, in comparison to violent weekend protests during which demonstrators broke dozens of windows on downtown businesses and set fires. He said police planned to release a tally later Monday of arrests that occurred during the curfew that ran from 8 p.m. Sunday until 6 a.m. Monday. Curfew violators were subject to arrest and fines. ___ MINNEAPOLIS "" The attorney for George Floyd's family was set to announce findings Monday of an independent autopsy into his death a week ago after a Minneapolis officer held his knee on Floyd's neck for several minutes. Floyd, a black man who was in handcuffs at the time, died after the white officer ignored bystander shouts to get off him and Floyd's cries that he couldn't breathe. His death, captured on citizen video, sparked days of protests in Minneapolis that have spread to cities around America. An official autopsy last week said the combined effects of being restrained, potential intoxicants in Floyd's system and his underlying health issues, including heart disease, likely contributed to his death. There were no other details about intoxicants, and toxicology results can take weeks. In the 911 call that drew police, the caller described the man suspected of paying with counterfeit money as 'awfully drunk and he's not in control of himself.' The criminal complaint noted that the medical examiner's report was preliminary, but said the autopsy 'revealed no physical findings that support a diagnosis of traumatic asphyxia or strangulation.' Ben Crump, the attorney representing Floyd's family, said last week that he was commissioning the family's own autopsy. ___ MADISON, Wisconsin "" Fifteen people were arrested after a second night of violence erupted Sunday night in Madison, Wisconsin, with police firing tear gas as protesters again threw rocks and damaged store downtown stores following an afternoon peaceful protest over the death of George Floyd. There were also protests in Milwaukee and Racine on Sunday night, continuing a weekend of unrest both in Wisconsin and across the country in reaction to Floyd's death. Madison police reported Monday that multiple stores were looted in the State Street area, a business corridor that connects the state Capitol to the University of Wisconsin campus. One of the 15 people arrested was armed with a handgun, police said. There were multiple unsuccessful attempts to steal a police squad car, the police said. A protest Sunday night in Milwaukee was mostly peaceful, but a crowd that gathered outside of a city police station was dispersed with tear gas. National Guard troops were deployed in both Madison and Milwaukee to assist local law enforcement. In Racine, about 150 people marched to the police station where they threw rocks at police who were wearing riot gear. The crowd dispersed after police fired tear gas. ___ MINNEAPOLIS "" Authorities say the driver of a semitrailer who rolled into the midst of thousands of people marching on a closed Minneapolis freeway over the death of George Floyd has been arrested on suspicion of assault. Authorities had said it appeared no one was hurt Sunday but some witnesses said a handful of people who were on Interstate 35W near downtown Minneapolis sought medical attention on their own. Authorities said they could not confirm that. The freeway was among many shut down in the Minneapolis area for the second night in a row as officials imposed an 8 p.m. curfew and sought to make it more difficult for protesters to move around. Bystander video showed the crowd parting seconds before the semi rolled through, then the tanker truck gradually slowed and demonstrators swarmed the truck. Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington said Sunday that it initially appeared from traffic camera footage that the semitrailer was already on the freeway before barricades were set up at 5 p.m. State Corrections Commissioner Paul Schnell said at a later briefing, however, that the truck went around a traffic barrier to stay on the road. ___ LONDON "" British Prime Minister Boris Johnson's spokesman says arrests and assaults on journalists covering protests in the United States are 'very concerning.' James Slack said Monday that 'journalists all around the world must be free to do their job and to hold authorities to account without fear of arrest or violence.' He said the violence of the past few nights was 'very alarming. People must be allowed to protest peacefully.' Slack said 'the footage of George Floyd's death was deeply distressing and our thoughts are with all those who have been affected.' Noting that a police officer has been charged with murder, he said 'we would hope and expect justice to be done.' ___ LOUISVILLE, Ky. "" The police chief of Louisville, Kentucky, says police officers and National Guard soldiers enforcing a curfew in Louisville killed a man early Monday when they returned fire after someone in a large group fired at them first. Louisville Metro Police Chief Steve Conrad confirmed the shooting happened around 12:15 a.m. outside a business on West Broadway, where police and the National Guard had been called to break up a large group of people gathering in defiance of the city's curfew. Someone fired a shot at them and the officers returned fire, the chief said. It was unclear if the person killed is the one who fired at the law enforcers, he said. Protests have erupted in Louisville over the shooting death of Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old EMT was shot eight times by narcotics detectives who knocked down her front door, as well as the death of George Floyd. ___ SIOUX FALLS, S.D. "" South Dakota Gov. Governor Kristi Noem activated the National Guard after protests in Sioux Fall turned violent over the death of George Floyd. The protest in South Dakota's largest city started Sunday afternoon with a march downtown. Police said dozens of protesters later congregated at the Empire Mall and began throwing rocks at officers and breaking windows. Police said protesters had dispersed by 11 p.m. Noem said about 70 Guard members are in Sioux Falls and will remain until they are no longer needed. ___ PARIS "" In France, family and friends of a French black man who died shortly after he was arrested by police in 2016 have called for a protest on Tuesday which will also pay homage to George Floyd. The circumstances of the death of Adama Traore, a French 24-old-man of Malian origin, are still under investigation by justice authorities. Calls for Tuesday's protest in front of the Paris court come after some medical experts last week attributed the death to a cardiac problem, the latest in a series of conflicting medical assessments. French police claimed Traore died of a heart attack due to pre-existing medical condition. His family said he died from asphyxiation from police tactics. In a video message published on social media, Traore's sister Assa Traore calls for protesters to express their indignation 'at a time when the world, when France is outraged by the death of George Floyd.' She said 'they had the same words, their last words: 'I can't breathe, I can't breathe.'"" She denounced the latest medical experts' report as 'racist' and 'untrue.' The family wants the officers in charge of Traore's arrest to go on trial. ___ ALBUQUERQUE, New Mexico "" A protest along the historic Route 66 into downtown Albuquerque turned violent early Monday after police reported demonstrators setting small fires and officers say they were fired upon. Albuquerque police spokesman Gilbert Gallegos says officers reported shots fired at them in front of the historic Kimo Theater early Monday after a mostly peaceful demonstration disbanded. Gallego said there was damage to several properties in the area, including broken windows and some stealing from stores. No injuries were reported. Before the chaos, hundreds of people on Sunday marched down historic Route 66, protesting the death of George Floyd. Protesters in New Mexico's largest city held signs, wore masks and chanted, 'Say his name: George Floyd' and 'Hands up, don't shoot.' Activist Arthur Bell told protesters there will be another demonstration Monday evening in front of Albuquerque Police Department headquarters, but that rally will be 'different.' When The Associated Press asked Bell what he meant by 'different,' he said: 'A general never gives out his tactics.'",0.0

Some police action has been directed against people smashing windows, breaking into stores and burning cars, but many find other instances more difficult to understand "" like the elderly man knocked over by police as he walked with a cane on a Salt Lake City sidewalk. The protests began after the May 25 death of George Floyd, a black man who died in Minneapolis after a white police officer who is now charged with murder, Derek Chauvin, pressed his knee into Floyd's neck for several minutes even after he stopped moving and pleading for air. Now, some are questioning whether tough police tactics against demonstrators are actually making the violence worse rather than quelling it. While the protests and subsequent police interactions may be shocking to some, many African Americans aren't surprised because they've endured police brutality for decades, said Chris White, director of the Detroit Coalition Against Police Brutality, 'What's happening, it's the way American society has always been,' White said. U.S. Rep. Joyce Beatty, who was hit by pepper spray Saturday as scuffles broke out near the end of a demonstration in Columbus, Ohio, said police escalated matters by using heavy-handed tactics against 'passionate' young demonstrators who were mostly orderly. 'Too much force is not the answer to this,' said Beatty, who pressed for peaceful tactics on both sides in a video posted on Twitter by Columbus City Council president Shannon Hardin, who also was pepper-sprayed. Both are African American. In Salt Lake City, a police officer shoved and knocked over an older man who was walking with a cane on a sidewalk near a protest. Another officer stepped in within seconds to assist the man, as did the officer who knocked him down. Police Chief Mike Brown issued a video Sunday saying he'd personally apologized to the man. 'It was hard for me to watch what happened, and I know it was even harder for him to experience it,' Brown said. In New York, where video showed two police vehicles driving into a crowd, knocking aside demonstrators, Mayor Bill de Blasio decried what he called ""structural racism"" that leads to violence against minorities, but also defended police. 'It is inappropriate for protesters to surround a police vehicle and threaten police officers,' he said. 'That's wrong on its face and that hasn't happened in the history of protests in this city.' Two police officers in Atlanta were fired and three others placed on desk duty over excessive use of force during a protest incident involving two college students Saturday night. Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said Sunday that she and the police chief made the decision after reviewing body-camera footage. Footage shown on TV as captured by local reporters shows a group of police officers in riot gear and gas masks surround a car being driven by a man with a woman in the passenger seat. The officers pull the woman out and appear to use a stun gun on the man. They use zip-tie handcuffs on the woman on the ground. In a message some saw as encouraging police violence, President Donald Trump praised U.S. Secret Service officers guarding the White House amid demonstrations and said any protesters who breached its fence would face 'the most vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons, I have ever seen. That's when people would have been really badly hurt, at least.' In a letter titled 'Dear America,' civil rights leader Rev. William Barber II, a pastor at Greenleaf Christian Church in Goldsboro, North Carolina, said protesters have the right to decry 'brutal and inhumane' treatment at the hands of police. 'What if, instead of a President who tweets 'when the looting starts, the shooting starts,' we had leadership that could unequivocally say, 'When you use police power in the name of the state to murder, lynch, and destroy, you will be prosecuted for your crimes,'"" Barber wrote. Trump wasn't alone in using loaded language. The Minnesota Department of Public Safety sent a tweet Saturday saying it would strengthen its response to 'a sophisticated network of urban warfare.' Hours later, video emerged of police shooting paint projectiles at people gathered on the front porch of a home after curfew in Minneapolis. 'Light 'em up,' a man is heard saying before the shooting began. No one appeared seriously injured. Activist Meeko Williams organized a peaceful demonstration in Detroit on Friday and later traveled to Minnesota to help support organizers there. Trying to understand what he sees as increasingly aggressive law enforcement tactics, Williams said police shouldn't 'antagonize, provoke or instigate' protesters. 'I don't know what's going to happen over these next few days in this country because they want these killer cops arrested and they're not going to stop until they are,' Williams said, referring to the lack of charges against the other three officers at the scene when Floyd's neck was pinned under Chauvin's knee. 'People are just sick and tired of being in this predicament, where innocent life has been taken at the hands of those who were to protect and serve us. We have not been heard.' Some protesters are increasing efforts to protect themselves. On Sunday, Black Lives Matter organizers in Tampa, Florida, had nearly 100 safety marshals in fluorescent vests patrolling their march, trained in de-escalation tactics. The group also had medics and enlisted lawyers and those with legal training to watch out for protesters' rights from the sidelines. In New York, a police labor group, the Detectives' Endowment Association, noted some police there had been attacked and patrol cars set ablaze. 'As we do everything to stop NYC from burning, all we hear from elected officials is criticism,"" the group tweeted.

(WPRI) ─ Jennifer Rourke, a Democratic candidate for the Rhode Island Senate, did not expect to be the target of racist comments during a virtual town hall forum Thursday night. “Personally, I’m numb,” she said. Rourke, an African-American woman challenging Senate Majority Leader Mike McCaffrey this November, said the comments came from eight people watching the town hall and were sent repeatedly throughout the forum. She said she was frustrated she spent most of her time reading racist expletives than answering political questions, and while the messages upset Rourke, one message, in particular, left her speechless. “Get Lynched, and then lynched, lynched, lynched,” Rourke said. “I have never in my life had anyone ever say that to me and they did.” The racist comments come as the nation grapples with the deadly arrest of George Floyd, an African-American man who died in police custody after a Minneapolis officer kneeled on his neck. That officer has since been fired and charged with murder. Floyd’s death has sparked outrage across the country, leading to violent protests in Minneapolis and beyond. Rourke said simply discussing racism isn’t enough, and more has to be done. “We do the peaceful protests people complain and when there are the angry protests people complain,” she said. “What are we going to do to make sure that we don’t need to protest anymore?” During her daily coronavirus briefing, Gov. Gina Raimondo was asked about the racist comments directed at Rourke. She had one message for those eight viewers. “Stop it, it is wrong and none of us can tolerate it,” she said. Rourke hopes that speaking out will make others realize that racism exists everywhere, including in Rhode Island. “I need you to understand that I get treated differently because of the way my skin is,” Rourke said. “I don’t have the privilege, you have the privilege and I need you to use your privilege to uplift people like me.”",0.0

The image includes 29 players and the caption: 'Unity is strength #BlackLivesMatter.' Virgil van Dijk, Trent Alexander-Arnold and captain Jordan Henderson were among those to post the picture. Liverpool is owned by Fenway Sports Group, the U.S. company that controls the Boston Red Sox. ___ A Fort Lauderdale police officer has been suspended after video showed him pushing a kneeling woman to the ground Sunday. Others on the force quickly pushed the officer away from the woman and then down the street as bottles were thrown. Mayor Dean Trantalis told reporters that the officer, who has not been named, is suspended pending an investigation. 'If it's turned out that he acted inappropriately, then we will have swift discipline in response to what he did,"" Trantalis said. ""We do not appreciate that kind of conduct, nobody in the department wants to be disrespected, and we feel this should never have happened.' ___ NASHVILLE, Tenn. "" A man who set fire to a historic courthouse in Tennessee during weekend protests has been arrested. Wesley Somers, 25, is charged with felony arson, vandalism and disorderly conduct. He is accused of setting fire to Nashville's Historic Courthouse on Saturday night. Metro Nashville Police said Somers was among 29 people arrested after protesters in Tennessee's capital set fires inside and outside the courthouse and toppled a statue of a former state lawmaker and newspaper publisher who espoused racist views. Protesters damaged 30 businesses. In addition to the courthouse, the Ryman Auditorium, known as the mother church of country music, was damaged, police said. Others who were arrested face charges that include assaulting police officers, disorderly conduct and criminal trespassing, police said. It wasn't immediately clear whether Somers has an attorney. Separate demonstrations were held in Murfreesboro, Chattanooga, and Memphis, where protesters made it onto Interstate 55, circumventing officers in riot gear. ___ BERLIN "" Protests against the death of George Floyd continued for a third day in Berlin, though the gathering outside the U.S. embassy Monday was significantly smaller than earlier rallies. Police said about 1,500 people took part in a march Sunday in the German capital's hip Kreuzberg district, after about 2,000 people staged a protest in front of the embassy Saturday. Paul Schreiner, 69 and originally from Wisconsin, was among a dozen people holding a vigil outside the embassy Monday. 'It's my duty, I feel, to be here,' he said. 'There's a very interesting phrase that 'white silence is violence,' and that moved me to make sure I came today.' Holding a sign with the names of George Floyd, Trayvon Martin, Eric Garner and others, American citizen Carmen Osorio Rodrigues said she was concerned about the direction the United States is heading. 'We have to confront these social injustices,' she said, adding: 'We need clear leadership on how to act.' ___ WASHINGTON "" Evidence of the chaos that erupted around the White House was visible as people streamed to work Monday morning. Plywood covered the windows of several shuttered businesses along one heavily traveled street leading to the White House, but a McDonald's that Bill Clinton frequented as president remained open, albeit with plywood structures reinforcing its street-facing windows. Blocks away, the windows of a major bank branch had been shattered and its exterior scrawled with expletive-filled graffiti expressing displeasure with such institutions. ___ SAN FRANCISCO "" San Francisco police officers seized firearms and explosives and arrested at least 80 people Sunday night on violating a curfew and looting charges. San Francisco Police Chief Bill Scott said demonstrations that drew about 1,000 people carrying signs and chanting 'George Floyd' and 'Black lives matter' were overwhelmingly peaceful Sunday and the vast majority of demonstrators dispersed without incident before the 8 p.m. curfew. But a relatively small number of 'defiant individuals' who had gathered in the Civic Center area refused to disperse, threw bottles at officers and started trash fires, Scott said. In response, officers and deputies with the sheriff's office began making arrests, he said. ___ INDIANAPOLIS "" An overnight curfew imposed by Indianapolis' mayor after two nights of violent protest over the death of George Floyd and police treatment of African Americans was followed by a night of relative calm after a weekend that left the city with widespread damage downtown, a police spokesman said Monday. Officer William Young of the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department said the city 'was relatively quiet' during the overnight curfew, in comparison to violent weekend protests during which demonstrators broke dozens of windows on downtown businesses and set fires. He said police planned to release a tally later Monday of arrests that occurred during the curfew that ran from 8 p.m. Sunday until 6 a.m. Monday. Curfew violators were subject to arrest and fines. ___ MINNEAPOLIS "" The attorney for George Floyd's family was set to announce findings Monday of an independent autopsy into his death a week ago after a Minneapolis officer held his knee on Floyd's neck for several minutes. Floyd, a black man who was in handcuffs at the time, died after the white officer ignored bystander shouts to get off him and Floyd's cries that he couldn't breathe. His death, captured on citizen video, sparked days of protests in Minneapolis that have spread to cities around America. An official autopsy last week said the combined effects of being restrained, potential intoxicants in Floyd's system and his underlying health issues, including heart disease, likely contributed to his death. There were no other details about intoxicants, and toxicology results can take weeks. In the 911 call that drew police, the caller described the man suspected of paying with counterfeit money as 'awfully drunk and he's not in control of himself.' The criminal complaint noted that the medical examiner's report was preliminary, but said the autopsy 'revealed no physical findings that support a diagnosis of traumatic asphyxia or strangulation.' Ben Crump, the attorney representing Floyd's family, said last week that he was commissioning the family's own autopsy. ___ MADISON, Wisconsin "" Fifteen people were arrested after a second night of violence erupted Sunday night in Madison, Wisconsin, with police firing tear gas as protesters again threw rocks and damaged store downtown stores following an afternoon peaceful protest over the death of George Floyd. There were also protests in Milwaukee and Racine on Sunday night, continuing a weekend of unrest both in Wisconsin and across the country in reaction to Floyd's death. Madison police reported Monday that multiple stores were looted in the State Street area, a business corridor that connects the state Capitol to the University of Wisconsin campus. One of the 15 people arrested was armed with a handgun, police said. There were multiple unsuccessful attempts to steal a police squad car, the police said. A protest Sunday night in Milwaukee was mostly peaceful, but a crowd that gathered outside of a city police station was dispersed with tear gas. National Guard troops were deployed in both Madison and Milwaukee to assist local law enforcement. In Racine, about 150 people marched to the police station where they threw rocks at police who were wearing riot gear. The crowd dispersed after police fired tear gas. ___ MINNEAPOLIS "" Authorities say the driver of a semitrailer who rolled into the midst of thousands of people marching on a closed Minneapolis freeway over the death of George Floyd has been arrested on suspicion of assault. Authorities had said it appeared no one was hurt Sunday but some witnesses said a handful of people who were on Interstate 35W near downtown Minneapolis sought medical attention on their own. Authorities said they could not confirm that. The freeway was among many shut down in the Minneapolis area for the second night in a row as officials imposed an 8 p.m. curfew and sought to make it more difficult for protesters to move around. Bystander video showed the crowd parting seconds before the semi rolled through, then the tanker truck gradually slowed and demonstrators swarmed the truck. Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington said Sunday that it initially appeared from traffic camera footage that the semitrailer was already on the freeway before barricades were set up at 5 p.m. State Corrections Commissioner Paul Schnell said at a later briefing, however, that the truck went around a traffic barrier to stay on the road. ___ LONDON "" British Prime Minister Boris Johnson's spokesman says arrests and assaults on journalists covering protests in the United States are 'very concerning.' James Slack said Monday that 'journalists all around the world must be free to do their job and to hold authorities to account without fear of arrest or violence.' He said the violence of the past few nights was 'very alarming. People must be allowed to protest peacefully.' Slack said 'the footage of George Floyd's death was deeply distressing and our thoughts are with all those who have been affected.' Noting that a police officer has been charged with murder, he said 'we would hope and expect justice to be done.' ___ LOUISVILLE, Ky. "" The police chief of Louisville, Kentucky, says police officers and National Guard soldiers enforcing a curfew in Louisville killed a man early Monday when they returned fire after someone in a large group fired at them first. Louisville Metro Police Chief Steve Conrad confirmed the shooting happened around 12:15 a.m. outside a business on West Broadway, where police and the National Guard had been called to break up a large group of people gathering in defiance of the city's curfew. Someone fired a shot at them and the officers returned fire, the chief said. It was unclear if the person killed is the one who fired at the law enforcers, he said. Protests have erupted in Louisville over the shooting death of Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old EMT was shot eight times by narcotics detectives who knocked down her front door, as well as the death of George Floyd. ___ SIOUX FALLS, S.D. "" South Dakota Gov. Governor Kristi Noem activated the National Guard after protests in Sioux Fall turned violent over the death of George Floyd. The protest in South Dakota's largest city started Sunday afternoon with a march downtown. Police said dozens of protesters later congregated at the Empire Mall and began throwing rocks at officers and breaking windows. Police said protesters had dispersed by 11 p.m. Noem said about 70 Guard members are in Sioux Falls and will remain until they are no longer needed. ___ PARIS "" In France, family and friends of a French black man who died shortly after he was arrested by police in 2016 have called for a protest on Tuesday which will also pay homage to George Floyd. The circumstances of the death of Adama Traore, a French 24-old-man of Malian origin, are still under investigation by justice authorities. Calls for Tuesday's protest in front of the Paris court come after some medical experts last week attributed the death to a cardiac problem, the latest in a series of conflicting medical assessments. French police claimed Traore died of a heart attack due to pre-existing medical condition. His family said he died from asphyxiation from police tactics. In a video message published on social media, Traore's sister Assa Traore calls for protesters to express their indignation 'at a time when the world, when France is outraged by the death of George Floyd.' She said 'they had the same words, their last words: 'I can't breathe, I can't breathe.'"" She denounced the latest medical experts' report as 'racist' and 'untrue.' The family wants the officers in charge of Traore's arrest to go on trial. ___ ALBUQUERQUE, New Mexico "" A protest along the historic Route 66 into downtown Albuquerque turned violent early Monday after police reported demonstrators setting small fires and officers say they were fired upon. Albuquerque police spokesman Gilbert Gallegos says officers reported shots fired at them in front of the historic Kimo Theater early Monday after a mostly peaceful demonstration disbanded. Gallego said there was damage to several properties in the area, including broken windows and some stealing from stores. No injuries were reported. Before the chaos, hundreds of people on Sunday marched down historic Route 66, protesting the death of George Floyd. Protesters in New Mexico's largest city held signs, wore masks and chanted, 'Say his name: George Floyd' and 'Hands up, don't shoot.' Activist Arthur Bell told protesters there will be another demonstration Monday evening in front of Albuquerque Police Department headquarters, but that rally will be 'different.' When The Associated Press asked Bell what he meant by 'different,' he said: 'A general never gives out his tactics.'",0.0

Some police action has been directed against people smashing windows, breaking into stores and burning cars, but many find other instances more difficult to understand "" like the elderly man knocked over by police as he walked with a cane on a Salt Lake City sidewalk. The protests began after the May 25 death of George Floyd, a black man who died in Minneapolis after a white police officer who is now charged with murder, Derek Chauvin, pressed his knee into Floyd's neck for several minutes even after he stopped moving and pleading for air. Now, some are questioning whether tough police tactics against demonstrators are actually making the violence worse rather than quelling it. While the protests and subsequent police interactions may be shocking to some, many African Americans aren't surprised because they've endured police brutality for decades, said Chris White, director of the Detroit Coalition Against Police Brutality, 'What's happening, it's the way American society has always been,' White said. U.S. Rep. Joyce Beatty, who was hit by pepper spray Saturday as scuffles broke out near the end of a demonstration in Columbus, Ohio, said police escalated matters by using heavy-handed tactics against 'passionate' young demonstrators who were mostly orderly. 'Too much force is not the answer to this,' said Beatty, who pressed for peaceful tactics on both sides in a video posted on Twitter by Columbus City Council president Shannon Hardin, who also was pepper-sprayed. Both are African American. In Salt Lake City, a police officer shoved and knocked over an older man who was walking with a cane on a sidewalk near a protest. Another officer stepped in within seconds to assist the man, as did the officer who knocked him down. Police Chief Mike Brown issued a video Sunday saying he'd personally apologized to the man. 'It was hard for me to watch what happened, and I know it was even harder for him to experience it,' Brown said. In New York, where video showed two police vehicles driving into a crowd, knocking aside demonstrators, Mayor Bill de Blasio decried what he called ""structural racism"" that leads to violence against minorities, but also defended police. 'It is inappropriate for protesters to surround a police vehicle and threaten police officers,' he said. 'That's wrong on its face and that hasn't happened in the history of protests in this city.' Two police officers in Atlanta were fired and three others placed on desk duty over excessive use of force during a protest incident involving two college students Saturday night. Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said Sunday that she and the police chief made the decision after reviewing body-camera footage. Footage shown on TV as captured by local reporters shows a group of police officers in riot gear and gas masks surround a car being driven by a man with a woman in the passenger seat. The officers pull the woman out and appear to use a stun gun on the man. They use zip-tie handcuffs on the woman on the ground. In a message some saw as encouraging police violence, President Donald Trump praised U.S. Secret Service officers guarding the White House amid demonstrations and said any protesters who breached its fence would face 'the most vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons, I have ever seen. That's when people would have been really badly hurt, at least.' In a letter titled 'Dear America,' civil rights leader Rev. William Barber II, a pastor at Greenleaf Christian Church in Goldsboro, North Carolina, said protesters have the right to decry 'brutal and inhumane' treatment at the hands of police. 'What if, instead of a President who tweets 'when the looting starts, the shooting starts,' we had leadership that could unequivocally say, 'When you use police power in the name of the state to murder, lynch, and destroy, you will be prosecuted for your crimes,'"" Barber wrote. Trump wasn't alone in using loaded language. The Minnesota Department of Public Safety sent a tweet Saturday saying it would strengthen its response to 'a sophisticated network of urban warfare.' Hours later, video emerged of police shooting paint projectiles at people gathered on the front porch of a home after curfew in Minneapolis. 'Light 'em up,' a man is heard saying before the shooting began. No one appeared seriously injured. Activist Meeko Williams organized a peaceful demonstration in Detroit on Friday and later traveled to Minnesota to help support organizers there. Trying to understand what he sees as increasingly aggressive law enforcement tactics, Williams said police shouldn't 'antagonize, provoke or instigate' protesters. 'I don't know what's going to happen over these next few days in this country because they want these killer cops arrested and they're not going to stop until they are,' Williams said, referring to the lack of charges against the other three officers at the scene when Floyd's neck was pinned under Chauvin's knee. 'People are just sick and tired of being in this predicament, where innocent life has been taken at the hands of those who were to protect and serve us. We have not been heard.' Some protesters are increasing efforts to protect themselves. On Sunday, Black Lives Matter organizers in Tampa, Florida, had nearly 100 safety marshals in fluorescent vests patrolling their march, trained in de-escalation tactics. The group also had medics and enlisted lawyers and those with legal training to watch out for protesters' rights from the sidelines. In New York, a police labor group, the Detectives' Endowment Association, noted some police there had been attacked and patrol cars set ablaze. 'As we do everything to stop NYC from burning, all we hear from elected officials is criticism,"" the group tweeted.

(AP Photo/Mark J. Terrill) WASHINGTON (AP) — With cities wounded by days of violent unrest, America headed into a new week with neighborhoods in shambles, urban streets on lockdown and shaken confidence about when leaders would find the answers to control the mayhem amid unrelenting raw emotion over police killings of black people. All of it smashed into a nation already bludgeoned by a death toll from the coronavirus pandemic surging past 100,000 and unemployment that soared to levels not seen since the Great Depression. Sunday capped a tumultuous weekend and month that saw city and state officials deploy thousands of National Guard soldiers, enact strict curfews and shut down mass transit systems. Even with those efforts, many demonstrations erupted into violence as protesters hurled rocks and Molotov cocktails at police in Philadelphia, set a fire near the White House and were hit with tear gas and pepper spray in Austin and other cities. Seven Boston police officers were hospitalized. In some cities, thieves smashed their way into stores and ran off with as much as they could carry, leaving shop owners, many of them just ramping up their business again after coronavirus pandemic lockdowns, to clean up their shattered storefronts. In others, police tried to calm tensions by kneeling in solidarity with demonstrators, while still maintaining a strong presence for security. The demonstrations were sparked by the death of George Floyd, a black man who pleaded for air as an officer pressed a knee into his neck. Floyd’s death in Minneapolis came after tensions had already flared after two white men were arrested in May for the February shooting death of black jogger Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia, and the Louisville police shooting death of Breonna Taylor in her home in March. The scale of the coast-to-coast protests rivaled the historic demonstrations of the civil rights and Vietnam War eras. “They keep killing our people. I’m so sick and tired of it,” said Mahira Louis, 15, who was at a Boston protest with her mother Sunday, leading chants of “George Floyd, say his name.” Tensions rose Sunday outside the White House, the scene of three days of demonstrations, where police fired tear gas and stun grenades into a crowd of more than 1,000 chanting protesters across the street in Lafayette Park. The crowd ran, piling up road signs and plastic barriers to light a raging fire in a nearby street. Some pulled an American flag from a building and threw it into the blaze. A building in the park with bathrooms and a maintenance office went up in flames. The district’s entire National Guard — roughly 1,700 soldiers — was called in to help control the protests, according to two Defense Department officials who insisted on anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the matter. As the protests grew, President Donald Trump retweeted conservative commentator Buck Sexton who called for “overwhelming force” against violent demonstrators. Former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, visited the site of protests in his hometown of Wilmington, Delaware, and talked to demonstrators. He also wrote a post on Medium expressing empathy for those despairing about Floyd’s killing. At least 4,400 people have been arrested over days of protests, according to a tally compiled by The Associated Press. Arrests ranged from stealing and blocking highways to breaking curfew. In Salt Lake City, an activist leader condemned the destruction of property but said broken buildings shouldn’t be mourned on the same level as black men like Floyd. “Maybe this country will get the memo that we are sick of police murdering unarmed black men,” said Lex Scott, founder of Black Lives Matter Utah. “Maybe the next time a white police officer decides to pull the trigger, he will picture cities burning.” Yet thousands still marched peacefully in Phoenix, Albuquerque and other cities, with some calling for an end to the fires, vandalism and theft, saying it weakened calls for justice and reform. In downtown Atlanta, authorities fired tear gas to disperse hundreds of demonstrators. Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said two officers had been fired and three placed on desk duty after video showed police surrounding a car Saturday, and using stun guns on the man and woman inside. In Los Angeles, a police SUV accelerated into several protesters in a street, knocking two people to the ground. Nearby in Santa Monica, not far from a peaceful demonstration, groups broke into stores, walking out with boxes of shoes and folding chairs, among other items. A fire broke out at a restaurant across the street. Scores swarmed into nearby outlet stores in Long Beach. Some hauled armloads of clothing from a Forever 21 store away in garbage bags. In Minneapolis, the officer who pressed his knee onto Floyd’s neck has been charged with murder, but protesters are demanding the other three officers at the scene be prosecuted. All four were fired. “We’re not done,” said Darnella Wade, an organizer for Black Lives Matter in neighboring St. Paul, where thousands gathered peacefully in front of the state Capitol. “They sent us the military, and we only asked them for arrests.” Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz brought in thousands of National Guard soldiers on Saturday to help quell violence that had damaged or destroyed hundreds of buildings in Minneapolis over days of protests. That appeared to help minimize unrest, but thousands marching on a closed freeway were shaken when a semitrailer rolled into their midst. Disgust over generations of racism in a country founded by slaveholders combined with a string of recent racially charged killings to stoke the anger. Adding to that was angst from lockdowns brought on by the pandemic, which has disproportionately hurt communities of color, not only in terms of infections but in job losses and economic stress. The droves of people congregating for demonstrations threatened to trigger new outbreaks, a fact overshadowed by the boiling tensions. In Indianapolis, two people were reported dead in bursts of downtown violence this weekend, adding to deaths reported in Detroit and Minneapolis. In tweets Sunday, Trump blamed anarchists and the media for fueling violence. Attorney General William Barr pointed a finger at “far left extremist” groups. Police chiefs and politicians accused outsiders of causing the problems. At the Minneapolis intersection where Floyd was killed, people gathered with brooms and flowers, saying it was important to protect what they called a “sacred space.” Among those in Minneapolis was Michael Brown Sr., the father of Michael Brown, whose killing by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, set off unrest in 2014. “I understand what this family is feeling. I understand what this community is feeling,” he said. Morrison reported from Minneapolis and Vertuno reported from Austin, Texas.

Thousands marched peacefully through the streets of Boston, culminating with a rally at the State House, where they demanded justice over the death of George Floyd, who died after being restrained by Minneapolis police officers last week. Later in the day, a police cruiser was set on fire near Downtown Crossing and stores along Boylston and Newbury Streets in the city’s Back Bay neighborhood were targeted by looters. Windows and doors were smashed and merchandise was stolen. Massachusetts State Police and the National Guard were in the city to back up the Boston officers, mainly in the area of Boylston, Newbury and Arlington Streets. The Boston Police Department confirmed Monday that nine officers were injured and transported to area hospitals, and many more were treated on scene. Police said 21 cruisers were damaged and 53 individuals were arrested on a variety of charges, including larceny, breaking and entering and malicious destruction of property. Of those arrests, a 20-year-old East Providence man will be summonsed for larceny under $1,200 and receiving stolen property. Massachusetts State Police also confirmed two of the arrests were protestors who jumped the fence outside the State House and tried to get onto State House property. On Twitter, Gov. Charlie Baker thanked the peaceful protesters for their positive message. “The murder of George Floyd at the hands of police was a horrible tragedy – one of countless tragedies to befall people of color across the United States,” he wrote. “The vast majority of protesters today did so peacefully, toward a common goal of promoting justice and equality. I am deeply thankful for their voices and their positive, forceful message.” The murder of George Floyd at the hands of police was a horrible tragedy – one of countless tragedies to befall people of color across the United States.

Floyd’s death in Minneapolis came after tensions had already flared after two white men were arrested in May for the February shooting death of black jogger Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia, and the Louisville police shooting death of Breonna Taylor in her home in March. The scale of the coast-to-coast protests rivaled the historic demonstrations of the civil rights and Vietnam War eras. “They keep killing our people. I’m so sick and tired of it,” said Mahira Louis, 15, who was at a Boston protest with her mother Sunday, leading chants of “George Floyd, say his name.” Tensions rose Sunday outside the White House, the scene of three days of demonstrations, where police fired tear gas and stun grenades into a crowd of more than 1,000 chanting protesters across the street in Lafayette Park. The crowd ran, piling up road signs and plastic barriers to light a raging fire in a nearby street. Some pulled an American flag from a building and threw it into the blaze. A building in the park with bathrooms and a maintenance office went up in flames. The district’s entire National Guard — roughly 1,700 soldiers — was called in to help control the protests, according to two Defense Department officials who insisted on anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the matter. As the protests grew, President Donald Trump retweeted conservative commentator Buck Sexton who called for “overwhelming force” against violent demonstrators. Former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, visited the site of protests in his hometown of Wilmington, Delaware, and talked to demonstrators. He also wrote a post on Medium expressing empathy for those despairing about Floyd’s killing. At least 4,400 people have been arrested over days of protests, according to a tally compiled by The Associated Press. Arrests ranged from stealing and blocking highways to breaking curfew. In Salt Lake City, an activist leader condemned the destruction of property but said broken buildings shouldn’t be mourned on the same level as black men like Floyd. “Maybe this country will get the memo that we are sick of police murdering unarmed black men,” said Lex Scott, founder of Black Lives Matter Utah. “Maybe the next time a white police officer decides to pull the trigger, he will picture cities burning.” Yet thousands still marched peacefully in Phoenix, Albuquerque and other cities, with some calling for an end to the fires, vandalism and theft, saying it weakened calls for justice and reform. In downtown Atlanta, authorities fired tear gas to disperse hundreds of demonstrators. Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said two officers had been fired and three placed on desk duty after video showed police surrounding a car Saturday, and using stun guns on the man and woman inside. In Los Angeles, a police SUV accelerated into several protesters in a street, knocking two people to the ground. Nearby in Santa Monica, not far from a peaceful demonstration, groups broke into stores, walking out with boxes of shoes and folding chairs, among other items. A fire broke out at a restaurant across the street. Scores swarmed into nearby outlet stores in Long Beach. Some hauled armloads of clothing from a Forever 21 store away in garbage bags. In Minneapolis, the officer who pressed his knee onto Floyd’s neck has been charged with murder, but protesters are demanding the other three officers at the scene be prosecuted. All four were fired. “We’re not done,” said Darnella Wade, an organizer for Black Lives Matter in neighboring St. Paul, where thousands gathered peacefully in front of the state Capitol. “They sent us the military, and we only asked them for arrests.” Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz brought in thousands of National Guard soldiers on Saturday to help quell violence that had damaged or destroyed hundreds of buildings in Minneapolis over days of protests. That appeared to help minimize unrest, but thousands marching on a closed freeway were shaken when a semitrailer rolled into their midst. Disgust over generations of racism in a country founded by slaveholders combined with a string of recent racially charged killings to stoke the anger. Adding to that was angst from lockdowns brought on by the pandemic, which has disproportionately hurt communities of color, not only in terms of infections but in job losses and economic stress. The droves of people congregating for demonstrations threatened to trigger new outbreaks, a fact overshadowed by the boiling tensions. In Indianapolis, two people were reported dead in bursts of downtown violence this weekend, adding to deaths reported in Detroit and Minneapolis. In tweets Sunday, Trump blamed anarchists and the media for fueling violence. Attorney General William Barr pointed a finger at “far left extremist” groups. Police chiefs and politicians accused outsiders of causing the problems. At the Minneapolis intersection where Floyd was killed, people gathered with brooms and flowers, saying it was important to protect what they called a “sacred space.” Among those in Minneapolis was Michael Brown Sr., the father of Michael Brown, whose killing by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, set off unrest in 2014. “I understand what this family is feeling. I understand what this community is feeling,” he said. Morrison reported from Minneapolis and Vertuno reported from Austin, Texas.

Thousands marched peacefully through the streets of Boston, culminating with a rally at the State House, where they demanded justice over the death of George Floyd, who died after being restrained by Minneapolis police officers last week. Later in the day, a police cruiser was set on fire near Downtown Crossing and stores along Boylston and Newbury Streets in the city’s Back Bay neighborhood were targeted by looters. Windows and doors were smashed and merchandise was stolen. Massachusetts State Police and the National Guard were in the city to back up the Boston officers, mainly in the area of Boylston, Newbury and Arlington Streets. The Boston Police Department confirmed Monday that nine officers were injured and transported to area hospitals, and many more were treated on scene. Police said 21 cruisers were damaged and 53 individuals were arrested on a variety of charges, including larceny, breaking and entering and malicious destruction of property. Of those arrests, a 20-year-old East Providence man will be summonsed for larceny under $1,200 and receiving stolen property. Massachusetts State Police also confirmed two of the arrests were protestors who jumped the fence outside the State House and tried to get onto State House property. On Twitter, Gov. Charlie Baker thanked the peaceful protesters for their positive message. “The murder of George Floyd at the hands of police was a horrible tragedy – one of countless tragedies to befall people of color across the United States,” he wrote. “The vast majority of protesters today did so peacefully, toward a common goal of promoting justice and equality. I am deeply thankful for their voices and their positive, forceful message.” The murder of George Floyd at the hands of police was a horrible tragedy – one of countless tragedies to befall people of color across the United States.

He also expressed his disappointment for those who did not remain peaceful. “I see you. I hear you. I will use my voice for you,” he wrote. “I am angered, however, by the people who came into our city and chose to engage in acts of destruction and violence, undermining their message. If we are to achieve change and if we are to lead the change, our efforts must be rooted in peace and regard for our community.” I see you. I hear you.

His announcement came as police under federal command forced back peaceful demonstrators with tear gas so he could walk to a nearby church and pose with a Bible. Trump's bellicose rhetoric came as the nation convulsed through another round of violence over the death of George Floyd at a time when the country is already buckling under the coronavirus outbreak and the Depression-level unemployment it has caused. The president demanded an end to the heated protests in remarks from the White House Rose Garden and vowed to use more force to achieve that aim. If governors throughout the country do not deploy the National Guard in sufficient numbers to 'dominate the streets,' Trump said the U.S. military would step in to 'quickly solve the problem for them.' 'We have the greatest country in the world,' the president declared. 'We're going to keep it safe.' A military deployment by Trump to U.S. states would mark a stunning federal intervention rarely seen in modern American history. Yet the message Trump appeared to be sending with the brazen pushback of protesters outside the White House was that he sees few limits to what he is willing to do. Some around the president likened the moment to 1968, when Richard Nixon ran as the law-and-order candidate in the aftermath of a summer of riots, capturing the White House. But despite his efforts to portray himself as a political outsider, Trump is an incumbent who risks being held responsible for the violence. Minutes before Trump began speaking, police and National Guard soldiers began aggressively forcing back hundreds of peaceful protesters who had gathered in Lafayette Park, across the street from the White House, where they were chanting against police brutality and Floyd's death in Minneapolis. As Trump spoke, tear gas canisters could be heard exploding. Floyd died last week after he was pinned to the pavement by a police officer who put his knee on the handcuffed black man's neck until he stopped breathing. His death set off protests that spread from Minneapolis across America. His brother Terrence pleaded with protesters on Monday to remain peaceful. Five months before Election Day, the president made clear that he would stake his reelection efforts on convincing voters that his strong-arm approach was warranted to quell the most intense civil unrest since the 1960s. He made little effort to address the grievances of black Americans and others outraged by Floyd's death and the scourge of police brutality, undermining what his campaign had hoped would be increased appeal to African American voters. The scene in and around the White House on Monday night appeared to be carefully orchestrated. As the crowd of protesters grew, Attorney General William Barr arrived in Lafayette Park to look over at the demonstrations and the swarm of law enforcement. The sudden shift in tactics against the protesters was initially a mystery. Then, after finishing his Rose Garden remarks, Trump emerged from the White House gates and walked through the park to St. John's Church, where an office had been set on fire the previous night. Trump, who rarely attends church, held up a Bible and gathered a group of advisers "" all white "" to pose for photos. The moment was quickly decried by Trump's critics, with New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo saying the president 'used the military to push out a peaceful protest so he could have a photo op at a church."" 'It's all just a reality TV show for this president,"" he said on Twitter. 'Shameful.' Federal law permits presidents to dispatch the military into states to suppress an insurrection or if a state is defying federal law, legal experts said. But Trump's statements also set up an immediate conflict with officials in New York and other states who asserted that the president does not have the unilateral right to send in troops against the will of local governments. The country has been beset by angry demonstrations for the past week in some of the most widespread racial unrest in the U.S. since the 1960s. Spurred largely by Floyd's death, protesters have taken to the streets to decry the killings of black people by police. Minneapolis Officer Derek Chauvin has been charged with murder, but protesters are demanding that three of his colleagues be prosecuted, too. All four were fired. While most of the demonstrations have been peaceful, others have descended into violence, leaving neighborhoods in shambles, stores ransacked, windows broken and cars burned, despite curfews around the country and the deployment of thousands of National Guard members in at least 15 states. On Monday, demonstrations erupted from Philadelphia, where hundreds of protesters spilled onto a highway in the heart of the city, to Atlanta, where police fired tear gas at demonstrators, to Nashville, where more than 60 National Guard soldiers put down their riot shields at the request of peaceful protesters who had gathered in front of Tennessee's state Capitol to honor Floyd. Two people were killed during protests in the Chicago suburb of Cicero, authorities said, but provided no details. In Louisville, Kentucky, riot police firing tear gas scattered several hundred protesters from downtown, violently capping a day of mostly peaceful protests. A vehicle plowed through a group of law enforcement officers at a demonstration in Buffalo, New York, injuring at least two. Video from the scene showed the vehicle accelerating through an intersection shortly after officers apparently tackled a protester and handcuffed him. The officers were hospitalized in stable condition, authorities said. In New York City, where nightfall has brought widespread scenes of destruction, large crowds rallied peacefully in Times Square and Brooklyn during the day. Then, in early evening, looters rushed into a Nike store in Manhattan and protesters smashed storefront windows near Rockefeller Center. Video posted on social media showed some protesters arguing with people breaking windows, urging them to stop. The city has already endured immense commercial damage from the unrest. On Monday, rioters got through the doors of the city's flagship Macy's store, famous for its Thanksgiving Day parade, and police later pulled at least two handcuffed men out of the store and put them into a van. By that time, most of the the street was littered with broken glass. In Washington, protesters continued marching peacefully through Washington hours after being forced from Lafayette park and past the 7 p.m. curfew. Eventually, within sight of the Capitol building, the marchers were turned back by law enforcement officers using tear gas, pellets and low-flying helicopters kicking up debris. As they dispersed, some protesters smashed windows at a nearby office building. Earlier Monday, Trump told the nation's governors in a video conference that they 'look like fools' for not deploying even more National Guard troops. 'Most of you are weak,' he said. He added: 'You've got to arrest people, you have to track people, you have to put them in jail for 10 years and you'll never see this stuff again.' Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, a Democrat, dismissed Trump's comments as the 'rantings of an insecure man trying to look strong after building his entire political career on racism.' Former Vice President Joe Biden, the Democratic presidential candidate, vowed to address institutional racism in his first 100 days in office. He met in person with black leaders in Delaware and also held a virtual meeting with big-city mayors. Biden said hate emerges 'when you have somebody in power who breathes oxygen into the hate.' In Minneapolis, meanwhile, Floyd's brother Terrence made an emotional plea for peace at the site where Floyd was arrested. 'Let's switch it up, y'all. Let's switch it up. Do this peacefully, please,"" Terrence Floyd said as he urged people to use their power at the ballot box. Also Monday, an autopsy commissioned for Floyd's family found that he died of asphyxiation from neck and back compression, the family's attorneys said. Authorities in many cities have blamed the violence on outside agitators, though have provided little evidence to back that up. But on Monday, federal authorities arrested a 28-year-old Illinois man saying he had posted self-recorded video on his Facebook page last week that showed him in Minneapolis handing out explosive devices and encouraging people to throw them at law enforcement officers. More than 5,600 people nationwide have been arrested over the past week for such offenses as stealing, blocking highways and breaking curfew, according to a count by The Associated Press. ___ Sullivan and Morrison reported from Minneapolis.

His announcement came as police under federal command forced back peaceful demonstrators with tear gas so he could walk to a nearby church and pose with a Bible. Trump's bellicose rhetoric came as the nation convulsed through another round of violence over the death of George Floyd at a time when the country is already buckling under the coronavirus outbreak and the Depression-level unemployment it has caused. The president demanded an end to the heated protests in remarks from the White House Rose Garden and vowed to use more force to achieve that aim. If governors throughout the country do not deploy the National Guard in sufficient numbers to 'dominate the streets,' Trump said the U.S. military would step in to 'quickly solve the problem for them.' 'We have the greatest country in the world,' the president declared. 'We're going to keep it safe.' A military deployment by Trump to U.S. states would mark a stunning federal intervention rarely seen in modern American history. Yet the message Trump appeared to be sending with the brazen pushback of protesters outside the White House was that he sees few limits to what he is willing to do. Some around the president likened the moment to 1968, when Richard Nixon ran as the law-and-order candidate in the aftermath of a summer of riots, capturing the White House. But despite his efforts to portray himself as a political outsider, Trump is an incumbent who risks being held responsible for the violence. Minutes before Trump began speaking, police and National Guard soldiers began aggressively forcing back hundreds of peaceful protesters who had gathered in Lafayette Park, across the street from the White House, where they were chanting against police brutality and Floyd's death in Minneapolis. As Trump spoke, tear gas canisters could be heard exploding. Floyd died last week after he was pinned to the pavement by a police officer who put his knee on the handcuffed black man's neck until he stopped breathing. His death set off protests that spread from Minneapolis across America. His brother Terrence pleaded with protesters on Monday to remain peaceful. Five months before Election Day, the president made clear that he would stake his reelection efforts on convincing voters that his strong-arm approach was warranted to quell the most intense civil unrest since the 1960s. He made little effort to address the grievances of black Americans and others outraged by Floyd's death and the scourge of police brutality, undermining what his campaign had hoped would be increased appeal to African American voters. The scene in and around the White House on Monday night appeared to be carefully orchestrated. As the crowd of protesters grew, Attorney General William Barr arrived in Lafayette Park to look over at the demonstrations and the swarm of law enforcement. The sudden shift in tactics against the protesters was initially a mystery. Then, after finishing his Rose Garden remarks, Trump emerged from the White House gates and walked through the park to St. John's Church, where an office had been set on fire the previous night. Trump, who rarely attends church, held up a Bible and gathered a group of advisers "" all white "" to pose for photos. The moment was quickly decried by Trump's critics, with New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo saying the president 'used the military to push out a peaceful protest so he could have a photo op at a church."" 'It's all just a reality TV show for this president,"" he said on Twitter. 'Shameful.' Federal law permits presidents to dispatch the military into states to suppress an insurrection or if a state is defying federal law, legal experts said. But Trump's statements also set up an immediate conflict with officials in New York and other states who asserted that the president does not have the unilateral right to send in troops against the will of local governments. The country has been beset by angry demonstrations for the past week in some of the most widespread racial unrest in the U.S. since the 1960s. Spurred largely by Floyd's death, protesters have taken to the streets to decry the killings of black people by police. Minneapolis Officer Derek Chauvin has been charged with murder, but protesters are demanding that three of his colleagues be prosecuted, too. All four were fired. While most of the demonstrations have been peaceful, others have descended into violence, leaving neighborhoods in shambles, stores ransacked, windows broken and cars burned, despite curfews around the country and the deployment of thousands of National Guard members in at least 15 states. On Monday, demonstrations erupted from Philadelphia, where hundreds of protesters spilled onto a highway in the heart of the city, to Atlanta, where police fired tear gas at demonstrators, to Nashville, where more than 60 National Guard soldiers put down their riot shields at the request of peaceful protesters who had gathered in front of Tennessee's state Capitol to honor Floyd. Two people were killed during protests in the Chicago suburb of Cicero, authorities said, but provided no details. In Louisville, Kentucky, riot police firing tear gas scattered several hundred protesters from downtown, violently capping a day of mostly peaceful protests. A vehicle plowed through a group of law enforcement officers at a demonstration in Buffalo, New York, injuring at least two. Video from the scene showed the vehicle accelerating through an intersection shortly after officers apparently tackled a protester and handcuffed him. The officers were hospitalized in stable condition, authorities said. In New York City, where nightfall has brought widespread scenes of destruction, large crowds rallied peacefully in Times Square and Brooklyn during the day. Then, in early evening, looters rushed into a Nike store in Manhattan and protesters smashed storefront windows near Rockefeller Center. Video posted on social media showed some protesters arguing with people breaking windows, urging them to stop. The city has already endured immense commercial damage from the unrest. On Monday, rioters got through the doors of the city's flagship Macy's store, famous for its Thanksgiving Day parade, and police later pulled at least two handcuffed men out of the store and put them into a van. By that time, most of the the street was littered with broken glass. In Washington, protesters continued marching peacefully through Washington hours after being forced from Lafayette park and past the 7 p.m. curfew. Eventually, within sight of the Capitol building, the marchers were turned back by law enforcement officers using tear gas, pellets and low-flying helicopters kicking up debris. As they dispersed, some protesters smashed windows at a nearby office building. Earlier Monday, Trump told the nation's governors in a video conference that they 'look like fools' for not deploying even more National Guard troops. 'Most of you are weak,' he said. He added: 'You've got to arrest people, you have to track people, you have to put them in jail for 10 years and you'll never see this stuff again.' Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, a Democrat, dismissed Trump's comments as the 'rantings of an insecure man trying to look strong after building his entire political career on racism.' Former Vice President Joe Biden, the Democratic presidential candidate, vowed to address institutional racism in his first 100 days in office. He met in person with black leaders in Delaware and also held a virtual meeting with big-city mayors. Biden said hate emerges 'when you have somebody in power who breathes oxygen into the hate.' In Minneapolis, meanwhile, Floyd's brother Terrence made an emotional plea for peace at the site where Floyd was arrested. 'Let's switch it up, y'all. Let's switch it up. Do this peacefully, please,"" Terrence Floyd said as he urged people to use their power at the ballot box. Also Monday, an autopsy commissioned for Floyd's family found that he died of asphyxiation from neck and back compression, the family's attorneys said. Authorities in many cities have blamed the violence on outside agitators, though have provided little evidence to back that up. But on Monday, federal authorities arrested a 28-year-old Illinois man saying he had posted self-recorded video on his Facebook page last week that showed him in Minneapolis handing out explosive devices and encouraging people to throw them at law enforcement officers. More than 5,600 people nationwide have been arrested over the past week for such offenses as stealing, blocking highways and breaking curfew, according to a count by The Associated Press. ___ Sullivan and Morrison reported from Minneapolis.

The protests over George Floyd's death hit the nation's capital Friday night as angry protesters arrived at Pennsylvania Avenue, leading to a lockdown at the White House. Outside the White House on Friday, Secret Service could be seen after 7 p.m. taking at least one person into custody. Videos showed a large group of protesters gathering, with some burning flags and knocking over barricades. There were also some violent encounters. The president remained there about an hour before returning to the residence, according to a Republican close to the White House and an administration official who spoke to the Associated Press on the condition of anonymity. It is currently unknown whether first lady Melania Trump and their son, Barron, were with the president but the family has been shaken by the size and venom of the crowds, AP reported. ""The White House does not comment on security protocols and decisions,” said White House spokesman Judd Deere. The Secret Service said it does not discuss the means and methods of its protective operations. Officials told The New York Times, which first reported the story, they never believed Trump was in danger but took the precaution of moving him to the bunker as tensions escalated. Trump has told advisers he worries about his safety, while both privately and publicly praising the work of the Secret Service, according to the AP. Floyd, an unarmed black man, died in Minneapolis police custody this week after a white officer pinned him to the ground under his knee. His death has sparked demonstrations against police brutality and racial discrimination in cities across the United States. Trump praised the Secret Service and said he “watched every move” from inside the White House during Friday's protest and that he “couldn't have felt more safe.” ""They let the ‘protesters’ scream & rant as much as they wanted, but whenever someone got too frisky or out of line, they would quickly come down on them, hard – didn’t know what hit them,"" he said Saturday. Trump continued, ""The front line was replaced with fresh agents, like magic. Big crowd, professionally organized, but nobody came close to breaching the fence. If they had, they would have been greeted with the most vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons, I have ever seen. That’s when people would have been really badly hurt, at least."" He also claimed DC Mayor Muriel Bowser didn't allow DC police to ""get involved"" and assist Secret Service, though Secret Service later said they were on the scene. Bowser, a Democrat, said on Twitter the city's police department would protect everyone regardless of whether the mayor agreed with them. ""While he hides behind his fence afraid/alone, I stand w/ people peacefully exercising their First Amendment Right after the murder of #GeorgeFloyd & hundreds of years of institutional racism There are no vicious dogs & ominous weapons. There is just a scared man,"" she wrote. This is the same bunker Vice President Dick Cheney was brought after the September 11 attacks when authorities feared a hijacked plane hijacked was heading toward the White House. President George W. Bush, when he returned to D.C. later that evening, was later taken there after a false alarm of another plane. The recent protests have led to one of the highest alerts at the White House complex since those attacks.",0.0

More than 4,400 arrests have been made at protests nationwide since viral video emerged showing former Minneapolis Officer Derek Chauvin holding his knee to Floyd's neck for more than eight minutes on Memorial Day, resulting in Floyd's death. Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo apologized to Floyd's family Sunday, saying that firing Chauvin and the other three officers involved in the incident was the right thing to do. Peaceful protests continued to be marred by violence. The Minneapolis Department of Public safety confirmed a semi-truck drove into a group of peaceful protesters on Interstate 35. The driver of the truck was taken into custody, but not before protesters pulled him from the truck's cab. The driver was taken to the hospital with minor injuries. Elsewhere, vandalism and looting continued across the country, as did the use of tear gas and rubber bullets by police in confrontations with protesters.

""But we also understand that the use of excessive force is never acceptable."" – Jessica Flores At least 4,400 arrests since George Floyd's death: AP data At least 4,400 people nationwide have been arrested over days of protests since George Floyd’s death on Memorial Day, according to a tally compiled by The Associated Press. About 150 people were arrested in Minnesota after violating curfew amid protests Sunday night, the Minnesota Department of Public Safety tweeted. DPS continued to tweet about arrests late into the night and added, ""Even peaceful protesters who are breaking curfew are subject to arrest. Please go home and stay there."" DPS announced the arrests of more than 155 people Saturday night across multiple agencies. A dozen firearms were confiscated between the State Patrol and the Minneapolis Police Department. Historic St. John's Church near White House set ablaze amid DC protests As protesters gathered near the White House, flames were seen at Washington, D.C., landmark that bills itself as ""the church of the presidents."" The fire, apparently an act of arson, was in the basement of St. John's Church, across from the White House, The Washington Post reported, and was extinguished. It occurred as a demonstration was taking place outside. The gathering had attracted as many as 1,000 Sunday, who faced off against officers in riot gear. The Episcopalian church in Lafayette Square boasts on its website that every U.S. president since James Madison has attended services. Consecrated in 1816, the church also says the bell in its steeple, weighing almost 1,000 pounds, was cast in 1822 by Paul Revere's son Joseph. Illinois governor calls on National Guard to assist Chicago police Vandalism and fires were reported in several Chicago neighborhoods and some suburbs Sunday night after Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot severely restricted access to downtown following nights of violent protests. The communities of Tinley Park, Crestwood and Oak Lawn alerted residents to stay home due to civil unrest. Many businesses boarded up. Gov. J.B. Pritzker said he activated 375 Illinois National Guard soldiers to assist local law enforcement with street closures. ""This has been a scary and unsettling time, but I know we will get through this and begin the process of healing together,"" Lightfoot said in a midnight Twitter post. ""Please stay safe, and stay home."" Minneapolis police chief: George Floyd's death 'a violation of humanity' Minneapolis Police Department Chief Medaria Arradondo told CNN that George Floyd's death was ""a violation of humanity."" Speaking at the site where Floyd died after fired police officer Derek Chauvin held his knee to Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes, Arradondo apologized to Floyd's family and said he had a ""visceral"" and ""emotional"" reaction to the video that has sparked outrage across the nation. “There are absolute truths in life,"" Arradondo told CNN. ""We need air to breathe. ... I did not need days or weeks or months or processes or bureaucracies to tell me what occurred out here last Monday, it was wrong.” When asked why he fired the four officers involved in the incident that led to Floyd's death, Arradondo said: ""In my mind, this was a violation of humanity. This was a violation of the oath the majority of the men and women that put this uniform on — this goes absolutely against it. This goes contrary to what we believe in."" Protesters vandalize, set fire to police SUVs in New Jersey A group of people was captured on video destroying police SUVs in Trenton, New Jersey. In the video, the people vandalize three police vehicles, smashing windows and hitting and kicking the vehicles. One of the people opens a door to the SUV and those at the scene start lighting things inside of it on fire. Police eventually got to the scene and began pushing back protesters as the vehicles burned behind them. Minnesota AG Keith Ellison to lead prosecution of Derek Chauvin Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz announced Sunday that state Attorney General Keith Ellison will lead the prosecution in the Floyd case. Ellison called the case “unusual because of the way that Mr. Floyd was killed and who did it — at the hands of the defendant who was a Minneapolis police officer.” He said he expects to work together with Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman on the case. Ellison didn’t announce additional charges for Chauvin or charges for the three other officers involved in the incident. He added “prosecuting police officers for misconduct, including homicide and murder, is very difficult.” “Every single link in the prosecutorial chain will come under attack as we present this case to a jury or a fact finder and we need to make sure that we be absolutely prepared. We intend to be absolutely prepared.”",0.0
1622343238,2020-06-01 06:05:46,"Officials see extremist groups, disinformation in protests",https://www.providencejournal.com/news/20200601/officials-see-extremist-groups-disinformation-in-protests?rssfeed=true,en,True,,68874,providencejournal.com,http://www.providencejournal.com/#spider,"WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. officials are seeking to determine whether extremist groups had infiltrated police brutality protests across the country and deliberately tipped largely peaceful demonstrations toward violence — and if foreign adversaries were behind a burgeoning disinformation campaign on social media. As demonstrations spread from Minneapolis to the White House, New York City and overseas Sunday, federal law enforcement officials insisted far-left groups were stoking violence. Meanwhile, experts who track extremist groups also reported seeing evidence of the far-right at work. Investigators were also tracking online interference and looking into whether foreign agents were behind the effort. Officials have seen a surge of social media accounts with fewer than 200 followers created in the last month, a textbook sign of a disinformation effort. The accounts have posted graphic images of the protests, material on police brutality and material on the coronavirus pandemic that appeared designed to inflame tensions across the political divide, according to three administration officials. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss investigations. The investigations are an attempt to identify the network of forces behind some of the most widespread outbreaks of civil unrest in the U.S. in decades. Protests erupted in dozens of cities in recent days, triggered by the death of George Floyd, who died after he was pinned at the neck by a white Minneapolis police officer's knee. Pandemic-weary Americans were already angry — about COVID-19 deaths, lockdown orders and tens of millions of people out of work. The pandemic has hit African Americans harder than whites in the U.S., and the killings of black people by police have continued over the years even as the topic faded from the national stage. But there are signs of people with other disparate motives, including anarchist graffiti, arrests of some out-of-state protesters, and images circulating in extremist groups that suggest the involvement of outside groups. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said Sunday that state authorities were hit with a cyber attack as law enforcement prepared to diffuse protests in Minneapolis and St. Paul, the epicenter of the unrest. He described it as a ""very sophisticated denial of service attack on all computers."" President Donald Trump, Attorney General William Bar and others have said the left-wing extremist group antifa is to blame. Short for anti-fascists, antifa is an umbrella term for far-left-leaning militant groups that resist neo-Nazis and white supremacists at demonstrations. Barr on Sunday said the FBI would use its regional joint terrorism task forces to ""identify criminal organizers,"" and Trump threatened again to name antifa a terrorist group. The Justice Department is also deploying members of the U.S. Marshals Service and agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration on Sunday to supplement National Guard troops outside the White House, a senior department official said. The official was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. The addition of the federal agents, who will have armored vehicles, came as Barr warned that prosecutors could seek to use terrorism statutes against ""violent radical agitators"" who attempt to hijack protests to cause destruction. An antifa activist group disseminated a message in a Telegram channel on Saturday that encouraged people to consider Minnesota National Guard troops ""easy targets,"" two Defense Department officials said. The message encouraged activists to steal ""kit,"" meaning the weapons and body armor used by the soldiers. The officials were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. As a result, soldiers with the Minnesota National Guard were armed during their mission at protests across the state Sunday, the officials said. The soldiers are sometimes armed but had not been since they moved into parts of the state that had been besieged by riots in the last few days. The troops do not have the authority to make arrests, and are there to act mostly as extra security for police. Others have seen evidence of right-wing extremists. J.J. MacNab, a fellow at George Washington University's Program on Extremism, has been monitoring chatter about the protests among anti-government extremists on social media platforms. She has access to dozens of private Facebook groups for followers of the loosely organized ""Boogaloo"" movement, which uses an '80s movie sequel as a code word for a second civil war. She also has been poring over images from the weekend protests and spotted some ""boogaloo bois"" in the crowds, carrying high-powered rifles and wearing tactical gear. ""They want to co-opt them in order to start their war. They see themselves as being on the side of protesters and that the protesters themselves are useful in causing anarchy,"" MacNab said. She also sees signs that the Three Percenters militia movement appears to be taking an interest. Megan Squire, an Elon University computer science professor who tracks online extremism, saw images of at least four members of the far-right Proud Boys group on the periphery of a protest Saturday night in Raleigh, North Carolina. Trump was expected in the coming days to draw distinctions between the legitimate anger of peaceful protesters and the unacceptable actions of violent agitators, said a White House official who was not authorized to discuss the plans ahead of time and spoke on condition of anonymity. The Trump administration has largely remained silent on local reports that far-right protesters were also involved. Meanwhile, Democratic mayors said Trump's handling of the crisis was reminiscent of one of the darkest moments of his presidency — when he said there were ""good people on both sides"" of protests in 2017 over white supremacists demonstrating in Charlottesville, Virginia. America's racial fault lines are a perfect opportunity for foreign adversaries looking to sow discord and portray the U.S. in a negative light, according to James Ludes, director of the Pell Center for International Relations and Public Policy at Salve Regina University in Rhode Island. ""This is a real issue and Americans are legitimately upset about it,"" said Ludes, who studies foreign disinformation tactics. ""That's one of the hallmarks of these campaigns. You don't create new issues, you exploit existing issues."" There's a history of this. In 2016, another black man, Philando Castile, was killed by police in a Minneapolis suburb, his death livestreamed on Facebook. Russians used a fake Black Lives Matter page to confuse and stoke anger among the protesters. There were nearly 700,000 followers, but it's not clear how many were real. One debunked example from this week: That Atlanta had deployed a ""child militia."" Floyd was accused of trying to pass a bad bill at a grocery store after he was laid off in the pandemic. Disturbing video showed him prone on the street, while a white police officer pressed his knee into Floyd's neck even as he cried he couldn't breathe. He later died. The officers have been fired; Derek Chauvin, the officer who pinned Floyd in the video, was charged with murder. At first there were peaceful demonstrations, but violence soon erupted. A Minneapolis police station was torched and protests took off around the country, growing increasingly tense. Video showed a police vehicle ramming into demonstrators in New York. Meanwhile, a van with four New York Police Department officers inside was hit with a Molotov cocktail and torched. Hundreds have been arrested nationwide and cities braced for more protests. But booking information from the county jail in Minneapolis, for example, showed that out of 59 protest-related arrests, 47 people had a home address in Minnesota, with the majority coming from the Twin Cities. Before protests began in New York City, organizers of anarchist groups began raising money for bail, recruited medical teams to deploy for violent interactions with police and planned how to target high-end stores, said John Miller, the NYPD's deputy commissioner of intelligence and counterterrorism. Scouts on bicycles would also move ahead of the groups to report where the police would be and then direct small breakaway groups to areas where they could torch police cars or throw Molotov cocktails, Miller said. The NYPD has arrested 786 people related to protests since May 28 and 1 in 7 of them were not from New York City, he said. In Washington, where protesters raged outside the White House, most of the 17 people arrested were from the area. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser said the groups seemed, at the least, organized to destroy with tools to break windows and distribute materials. ___ Associated Press writers Kathleen Hennessey in Minneapolis; Michael Kunzelman in Silver Spring, Md.; Michael R.

""But we also understand that the use of excessive force is never acceptable."" – Jessica Flores At least 4,400 arrests since George Floyd's death: AP data At least 4,400 people nationwide have been arrested over days of protests since George Floyd’s death on Memorial Day, according to a tally compiled by The Associated Press. About 150 people were arrested in Minnesota after violating curfew amid protests Sunday night, the Minnesota Department of Public Safety tweeted. DPS continued to tweet about arrests late into the night and added, ""Even peaceful protesters who are breaking curfew are subject to arrest. Please go home and stay there."" DPS announced the arrests of more than 155 people Saturday night across multiple agencies. A dozen firearms were confiscated between the State Patrol and the Minneapolis Police Department. Historic St. John's Church near White House set ablaze amid DC protests As protesters gathered near the White House, flames were seen at Washington, D.C., landmark that bills itself as ""the church of the presidents."" The fire, apparently an act of arson, was in the basement of St. John's Church, across from the White House, The Washington Post reported, and was extinguished. It occurred as a demonstration was taking place outside. The gathering had attracted as many as 1,000 Sunday, who faced off against officers in riot gear. The Episcopalian church in Lafayette Square boasts on its website that every U.S. president since James Madison has attended services. Consecrated in 1816, the church also says the bell in its steeple, weighing almost 1,000 pounds, was cast in 1822 by Paul Revere's son Joseph. Illinois governor calls on National Guard to assist Chicago police Vandalism and fires were reported in several Chicago neighborhoods and some suburbs Sunday night after Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot severely restricted access to downtown following nights of violent protests. The communities of Tinley Park, Crestwood and Oak Lawn alerted residents to stay home due to civil unrest. Many businesses boarded up. Gov. J.B. Pritzker said he activated 375 Illinois National Guard soldiers to assist local law enforcement with street closures. ""This has been a scary and unsettling time, but I know we will get through this and begin the process of healing together,"" Lightfoot said in a midnight Twitter post. ""Please stay safe, and stay home."" Minneapolis police chief: George Floyd's death 'a violation of humanity' Minneapolis Police Department Chief Medaria Arradondo told CNN that George Floyd's death was ""a violation of humanity."" Speaking at the site where Floyd died after fired police officer Derek Chauvin held his knee to Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes, Arradondo apologized to Floyd's family and said he had a ""visceral"" and ""emotional"" reaction to the video that has sparked outrage across the nation. “There are absolute truths in life,"" Arradondo told CNN. ""We need air to breathe. ... I did not need days or weeks or months or processes or bureaucracies to tell me what occurred out here last Monday, it was wrong.” When asked why he fired the four officers involved in the incident that led to Floyd's death, Arradondo said: ""In my mind, this was a violation of humanity. This was a violation of the oath the majority of the men and women that put this uniform on — this goes absolutely against it. This goes contrary to what we believe in."" Protesters vandalize, set fire to police SUVs in New Jersey A group of people was captured on video destroying police SUVs in Trenton, New Jersey. In the video, the people vandalize three police vehicles, smashing windows and hitting and kicking the vehicles. One of the people opens a door to the SUV and those at the scene start lighting things inside of it on fire. Police eventually got to the scene and began pushing back protesters as the vehicles burned behind them. Minnesota AG Keith Ellison to lead prosecution of Derek Chauvin Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz announced Sunday that state Attorney General Keith Ellison will lead the prosecution in the Floyd case. Ellison called the case “unusual because of the way that Mr. Floyd was killed and who did it — at the hands of the defendant who was a Minneapolis police officer.” He said he expects to work together with Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman on the case. Ellison didn’t announce additional charges for Chauvin or charges for the three other officers involved in the incident. He added “prosecuting police officers for misconduct, including homicide and murder, is very difficult.” “Every single link in the prosecutorial chain will come under attack as we present this case to a jury or a fact finder and we need to make sure that we be absolutely prepared. We intend to be absolutely prepared.”",0.0

(AP Photo/Matt Rourke, File) WASHINGTON (AP) — Joe Biden’s search for a running mate could be reshaped by the police killing of George Floyd and the unrest it has ignited across the country, raising questions about contenders with law-and-order backgrounds and intensifying pressure on the presumptive Democratic nominee to select a black woman. Biden, who has already pledged to pick a woman, has cast a wide net in his search. Some of the women on his list have drawn national praise amid the protests over Floyd’s death, including Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, who delivered an impassioned appeal for calm in her city on Friday night. But the outcry over police brutality against minorities has complicated the prospects of Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who had a controversial record addressing police violence as a prosecutor in the city where Floyd died. Biden’s choice of a running mate will be among the most consequential decisions he makes in the campaign, particularly given that the 77-year-old is already talking about himself as a “transition” candidate to a new generation of Democratic leaders. His pick will also be viewed as a signal both of his values and who he believes should have representation at the highest level of the American government. Even before the outcry over Floyd’s death, some Biden allies were already urging him to put a black woman on the ticket given the critical role African Americans played in his path to the Democratic nomination. Those calls have gotten louder in recent days. “The more we see this level of hatred, the more I think it’s important to confront it with symbolic acts, including potentially the selection of an African American woman as vice president,” said Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers and one of the labor leaders who’s been asked for input by Biden’s team on the selection process. Biden was pressed to pick a black woman on Monday when he visited a black church in Wilmington, Delaware. “A black female will overwhelm and excite and turn the heads of these young people and everybody out there,” an attendee told Biden, referring to those demonstrating in the streets. Beyond Bottoms, Biden is believed to be considering California Sen. Kamala Harris, Florida Rep. Val Demings and Stacey Abrams, the Georgia Democrat and voting rights activist. In an interview Sunday with The Associated Press, Demings didn’t answer directly when asked if the events of the past week increased pressure on Biden to choose a black woman. “Well, we’ve never seen a black woman selected as a vice presidential candidate,” she said. “But I think the American people want someone who cares about their issues and are willing to move the ball forward.” Politicians with law-and-order backgrounds have been viewed skeptically by some in the Democratic Party given the high-profile instances of police brutality against minorities and other inequities in the criminal justice system. Demings, a former Orlando police chief, defended herself and other potential contenders with such backgrounds, declaring “you’re either gonna be part of the problem or part of the solution.” “The community wants people who understand the system from the inside out in order to bring real life necessary reforms,” she said. Harris faced criticism throughout her Democratic primary campaign for her record as a prosecutor and attorney general in California, when she resisted reforms that would have required her office to investigate killings by police and established statewide standards for body cameras. Former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid suggested a resume as a prosecutor could be problematic for potential contenders. “Prosecutors are not very popular, especially among young people now,” he said. “I’ve got a granddaughter who is graduating from law school and she wants to be a public defender. She doesn’t want to be a prosecutor. And I think a lot of younger people feel the same.” Klobuchar, who also sought the Democratic nomination, has faced questions about her eight years as prosecutor for Minnesota’s largest county during the primary. Most of the more than two dozen people who died during police encounters in her tenure were people of color, according to data compiled by Communities United Against Police Brutality and news articles reviewed by the AP. An officer involved in one of those past fatal incidents was Derek Chauvin, who was arrested and charged Friday with Floyd’s murder. Since ending her campaign, Klobuchar has emerged as a key Biden surrogate and some Democrats see her as a running mate who could help him appeal to some of the white, working-class voters who turned against the party in the 2016 election. Yet some Democrats say the renewed focus on police brutality could complicate her path. “This is very tough timing for her,” said Rep. James Clyburn, D-S.C., a top Biden ally. Klobuchar has said that she is confident Biden will make the right choice and that she’s not thinking about politics right now. Biden has said he will announce a running mate by Aug. 1, a timeline that leaves plenty of time for the national mood to shift again, particularly as the coronavirus pandemic and resulting economic collapse pressed on. Biden’s search process is still in a relatively early phase. A search committee has been meeting with power players on the left, with special attention to Democratic leaders on Capitol Hill and across organized labor. Biden, who has largely been cloistered at his home in Delaware during the pandemic, would also like to conduct in person meetings with finalists. “It’s important for him to see the candidate, talk to the candidate, get body language from the candidate.

The protests over George Floyd's death hit the nation's capital Friday night as angry protesters arrived at Pennsylvania Avenue, leading to a lockdown at the White House. Outside the White House on Friday, Secret Service could be seen after 7 p.m. taking at least one person into custody. Videos showed a large group of protesters gathering, with some burning flags and knocking over barricades. There were also some violent encounters. The president remained there about an hour before returning to the residence, according to a Republican close to the White House and an administration official who spoke to the Associated Press on the condition of anonymity. It is currently unknown whether first lady Melania Trump and their son, Barron, were with the president but the family has been shaken by the size and venom of the crowds, AP reported. ""The White House does not comment on security protocols and decisions,” said White House spokesman Judd Deere. The Secret Service said it does not discuss the means and methods of its protective operations. Officials told The New York Times, which first reported the story, they never believed Trump was in danger but took the precaution of moving him to the bunker as tensions escalated. Trump has told advisers he worries about his safety, while both privately and publicly praising the work of the Secret Service, according to the AP. Floyd, an unarmed black man, died in Minneapolis police custody this week after a white officer pinned him to the ground under his knee. His death has sparked demonstrations against police brutality and racial discrimination in cities across the United States. Trump praised the Secret Service and said he “watched every move” from inside the White House during Friday's protest and that he “couldn't have felt more safe.” ""They let the ‘protesters’ scream & rant as much as they wanted, but whenever someone got too frisky or out of line, they would quickly come down on them, hard – didn’t know what hit them,"" he said Saturday. Trump continued, ""The front line was replaced with fresh agents, like magic. Big crowd, professionally organized, but nobody came close to breaching the fence. If they had, they would have been greeted with the most vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons, I have ever seen. That’s when people would have been really badly hurt, at least."" He also claimed DC Mayor Muriel Bowser didn't allow DC police to ""get involved"" and assist Secret Service, though Secret Service later said they were on the scene. Bowser, a Democrat, said on Twitter the city's police department would protect everyone regardless of whether the mayor agreed with them. ""While he hides behind his fence afraid/alone, I stand w/ people peacefully exercising their First Amendment Right after the murder of #GeorgeFloyd & hundreds of years of institutional racism There are no vicious dogs & ominous weapons. There is just a scared man,"" she wrote. This is the same bunker Vice President Dick Cheney was brought after the September 11 attacks when authorities feared a hijacked plane hijacked was heading toward the White House. President George W. Bush, when he returned to D.C. later that evening, was later taken there after a false alarm of another plane.

Protesters hurled rocks and Molotov cocktails at police in Philadelphia, set a fire near the White House and were hit with tear gas and pepper spray in Austin, Texas, and other cities. Seven Boston police officers were hospitalized. Police officers and National Guard soldiers enforcing a curfew in Louisville, Kentucky, killed a man early Monday when they returned fire after someone in a large group shot at them first, police said.

The upheaval has unfolded amid the gloom and economic ruin caused by the coronavirus, which has killed over 100,000 Americans and sent unemployment soaring to levels not seen since the Depression. The outbreak has hit minorities especially hard, not just in infections and deaths but in job losses and economic stress. The scale of the coast-to-coast protests has rivaled the historic demonstrations of the civil rights and Vietnam War eras. At least 4,400 people have been arrested for such offenses as stealing, blocking highways and breaking curfew, according to a count compiled by The Associated Press. “They keep killing our people.

(NEXSTAR/AP) – After six straight days of unrest, America heads into a new work week with neighborhoods in shambles, urban streets on lockdown and political leaders struggling to control the coast-to-coast outpouring of rage over police killings of black people. Despite curfews in big cities across the U.S. and the deployment of thousands of National Guard soldiers over the past week, demonstrations descended into violence again on Sunday.

Protesters hurled rocks and Molotov cocktails at police in Philadelphia, set a fire near the White House and were hit with tear gas and pepper spray in Austin, Texas, and other cities. Seven Boston police officers were hospitalized. Police officers and National Guard soldiers enforcing a curfew in Louisville, Kentucky, killed a man early Monday when they returned fire after someone in a large group shot at them first, police said. In Indianapolis, two people were reported dead in bursts of downtown violence over the weekend, adding to deaths recorded in Detroit and Minneapolis.

1622395841,2020-06-01 08:02:55,Trump briefly taken to underground bunker as protests grew outside White House,https://www.newportri.com/zz/news/20200601/trump-briefly-taken-to-underground-bunker-as-protests-grew-outside-white-house?rssfeed=true,en,False,,662951,Newport Life,http://www.newportlifemagazine.com/,"WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump was briefly moved to the White House's underground bunker Friday night to shelter in place for a brief period of time as the protest grew outside the Executive Mansion. The protests over George Floyd's death hit the nation's capital Friday night as angry protesters arrived at Pennsylvania Avenue, leading to a lockdown at the White House. Outside the White House on Friday, Secret Service could be seen after 7 p.m. taking at least one person into custody. Videos showed a large group of protesters gathering, with some burning flags and knocking over barricades. There were also some violent encounters. The president remained there about an hour before returning to the residence, according to a Republican close to the White House and an administration official who spoke to the Associated Press on the condition of anonymity. It is currently unknown whether first lady Melania Trump and their son, Barron, were with the president but the family has been shaken by the size and venom of the crowds, AP reported. ""The White House does not comment on security protocols and decisions,” said White House spokesman Judd Deere. The Secret Service said it does not discuss the means and methods of its protective operations. Officials told The New York Times, which first reported the story, they never believed Trump was in danger but took the precaution of moving him to the bunker as tensions escalated. Trump has told advisers he worries about his safety, while both privately and publicly praising the work of the Secret Service, according to the AP. Floyd, an unarmed black man, died in Minneapolis police custody this week after a white officer pinned him to the ground under his knee. His death has sparked demonstrations against police brutality and racial discrimination in cities across the United States. Trump praised the Secret Service and said he “watched every move” from inside the White House during Friday's protest and that he “couldn't have felt more safe.” ""They let the ‘protesters’ scream & rant as much as they wanted, but whenever someone got too frisky or out of line, they would quickly come down on them, hard – didn’t know what hit them,"" he said Saturday. Trump continued, ""The front line was replaced with fresh agents, like magic. Big crowd, professionally organized, but nobody came close to breaching the fence. If they had, they would have been greeted with the most vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons, I have ever seen. That’s when people would have been really badly hurt, at least."" He also claimed DC Mayor Muriel Bowser didn't allow DC police to ""get involved"" and assist Secret Service, though Secret Service later said they were on the scene. Bowser, a Democrat, said on Twitter the city's police department would protect everyone regardless of whether the mayor agreed with them. ""While he hides behind his fence afraid/alone, I stand w/ people peacefully exercising their First Amendment Right after the murder of #GeorgeFloyd & hundreds of years of institutional racism There are no vicious dogs & ominous weapons. There is just a scared man,"" she wrote. This is the same bunker Vice President Dick Cheney was brought after the September 11 attacks when authorities feared a hijacked plane hijacked was heading toward the White House. President George W. Bush, when he returned to D.C. later that evening, was later taken there after a false alarm of another plane. The recent protests have led to one of the highest alerts at the White House complex since those attacks.",0.0

More than 4,400 arrests have been made at protests nationwide since viral video emerged showing former Minneapolis Officer Derek Chauvin holding his knee to Floyd's neck for more than eight minutes on Memorial Day, resulting in Floyd's death. Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo apologized to Floyd's family Sunday, saying that firing Chauvin and the other three officers involved in the incident was the right thing to do. Peaceful protests continued to be marred by violence. The Minneapolis Department of Public safety confirmed a semi-truck drove into a group of peaceful protesters on Interstate 35. The driver of the truck was taken into custody, but not before protesters pulled him from the truck's cab. The driver was taken to the hospital with minor injuries. Elsewhere, vandalism and looting continued across the country, as did the use of tear gas and rubber bullets by police in confrontations with protesters. Reports: President Trump hustled to bunker amid Washington protests President Donald Trump was briefly moved to the White House's underground bunker Friday night to shelter in place as the protest grew outside the Executive Mansion, according to multiple outlets. The protests over George Floyd's death hit the nation's capital Friday night as angry protesters arrived at Pennsylvania Avenue, leading to a lockdown at the White House. Dozens of Secret Service agents were injured in clashes with protesters over the weekend, and videos showed a large group of protesters – some burning flags and knocking over barricades. CNN reported that the president remained in the bunker for about an hour before returning to the residence, and it is currently unknown whether the First Lady and their son, Barron, were with him. – Savannah Behrmann 2 Atlanta officers fired, accused of excessive force against protesters Atlanta officials fired two police officers and placed three on desk duty pending review over the alleged use of excessive force against protesters in a clash Saturday night. Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said she saw a video, which she called ""disturbing,"" of five officers pulling two college students out of a car downtown. Bottoms and police Chief Erika Shields made the announcement at a press conference after reviewing body-camera footage. ""We understand that our officers are working very long hours under an enormous amount of stress,"" Bottoms said. ""But we also understand that the use of excessive force is never acceptable."" – Jessica Flores At least 4,400 arrests since George Floyd's death: AP data At least 4,400 people nationwide have been arrested over days of protests since George Floyd’s death on Memorial Day, according to a tally compiled by The Associated Press. About 150 people were arrested in Minnesota after violating curfew amid protests Sunday night, the Minnesota Department of Public Safety tweeted. DPS continued to tweet about arrests late into the night and added, ""Even peaceful protesters who are breaking curfew are subject to arrest. Please go home and stay there."" DPS announced the arrests of more than 155 people Saturday night across multiple agencies. A dozen firearms were confiscated between the State Patrol and the Minneapolis Police Department. Historic St. John's Church near White House set ablaze amid DC protests As protesters gathered near the White House, flames were seen at Washington, D.C., landmark that bills itself as ""the church of the presidents."" The fire, apparently an act of arson, was in the basement of St. John's Church, across from the White House, The Washington Post reported, and was extinguished. It occurred as a demonstration was taking place outside. The gathering had attracted as many as 1,000 Sunday, who faced off against officers in riot gear. The Episcopalian church in Lafayette Square boasts on its website that every U.S. president since James Madison has attended services. Consecrated in 1816, the church also says the bell in its steeple, weighing almost 1,000 pounds, was cast in 1822 by Paul Revere's son Joseph. Illinois governor calls on National Guard to assist Chicago police Vandalism and fires were reported in several Chicago neighborhoods and some suburbs Sunday night after Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot severely restricted access to downtown following nights of violent protests. The communities of Tinley Park, Crestwood and Oak Lawn alerted residents to stay home due to civil unrest. Many businesses boarded up. Gov. J.B. Pritzker said he activated 375 Illinois National Guard soldiers to assist local law enforcement with street closures. ""This has been a scary and unsettling time, but I know we will get through this and begin the process of healing together,"" Lightfoot said in a midnight Twitter post. ""Please stay safe, and stay home."" Minneapolis police chief: George Floyd's death 'a violation of humanity' Minneapolis Police Department Chief Medaria Arradondo told CNN that George Floyd's death was ""a violation of humanity."" Speaking at the site where Floyd died after fired police officer Derek Chauvin held his knee to Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes, Arradondo apologized to Floyd's family and said he had a ""visceral"" and ""emotional"" reaction to the video that has sparked outrage across the nation. “There are absolute truths in life,"" Arradondo told CNN. ""We need air to breathe. ... I did not need days or weeks or months or processes or bureaucracies to tell me what occurred out here last Monday, it was wrong.” When asked why he fired the four officers involved in the incident that led to Floyd's death, Arradondo said: ""In my mind, this was a violation of humanity. This was a violation of the oath the majority of the men and women that put this uniform on — this goes absolutely against it. This goes contrary to what we believe in."" Protesters vandalize, set fire to police SUVs in New Jersey A group of people was captured on video destroying police SUVs in Trenton, New Jersey. In the video, the people vandalize three police vehicles, smashing windows and hitting and kicking the vehicles. One of the people opens a door to the SUV and those at the scene start lighting things inside of it on fire. Police eventually got to the scene and began pushing back protesters as the vehicles burned behind them. Minnesota AG Keith Ellison to lead prosecution of Derek Chauvin Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz announced Sunday that state Attorney General Keith Ellison will lead the prosecution in the Floyd case. Ellison called the case “unusual because of the way that Mr. Floyd was killed and who did it — at the hands of the defendant who was a Minneapolis police officer.” He said he expects to work together with Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman on the case. Ellison didn’t announce additional charges for Chauvin or charges for the three other officers involved in the incident. He added “prosecuting police officers for misconduct, including homicide and murder, is very difficult.” “Every single link in the prosecutorial chain will come under attack as we present this case to a jury or a fact finder and we need to make sure that we be absolutely prepared. We intend to be absolutely prepared.”",0.0
1622399864,2020-06-01 10:51:55,What is antifa and what does the movement want?,https://www.newportri.com/zz/news/20200601/what-is-antifa-and-what-does-movement-want?rssfeed=true,en,False,,653261,Mercury - United States - Rhode Island,http://www.newportmercury.com/,"Antifa — short for ""anti-fascist"" — is the name for loosely affiliated, left-leaning anti-racist groups that monitor and track the activities of local neo-Nazis. The movement has no unified structure or national leadership but has emerged in the form of local bodies nationwide, particularly on the West Coast. Some of the groups, such as the 10-year-old Rose City Antifa in Portland, the oldest antifa group in the U.S., are particularly well-organized and active online and on Facebook, while its members are individually anonymous. President Trump has singled out antifa as part of what he calls the alt-left in his initial claim that ""many sides"" were to blame for violence in Charlottesville the weekend of Aug. 12, not just the neo-Nazis, KKK and white nationalists. How is it pronounced? ""AN-tifa"" with the emphasis on the first syllable, which sounds more like ""on"" in English than ""an."" When did it start? Anti-fascist groups, particularly in Europe, have been around for many decades, notably in Italy, against Mussolini, and in Germany, against Hitler. In the postwar period, antifa groups resurged to fight neo-Nazi groups, particularly in Germany. In the U.S., the anti-fascist movements grew out of leftist politics of the late '80s, primarily under the umbrella of Anti-Racist Action. What does the movement want? The primary goal is to stop neo-Nazis and white supremacists from gaining a platform rather than to promote a specific antifa agenda. The antifa groups are decidedly anti-racist, anti-sexist and anti-homophobia, but also by and large socially leftist and anti-capitalist. How do the groups operate? Mark Bray, a lecturer and Dartmouth and author of the new book Antifa: The Antifascist Handbook, says the groups ""organize educational campaigns, build community coalitions, monitor fascists, pressure venues to cancel their events, organize self-defense trainings and physically confront the far right when necessary."" A main goal is to try to deny fascists a public forum, which is why they turn out in numbers to physically confront neo-Nazis, the KKK and white supremacists at public demonstrations. They also step in to protect counter-protesters at such events. In addition, antifa is particularly active in ""doxxing,"" or identifying neo-Nazis and like-minded individuals and disseminating that private information to the public and employers to discourage people from joining their ranks. Is antifa violent? Members pointedly do not eschew violence but rather see themselves as engaging in ""self-defense,"" protecting other protesters and primarily confronting neo-Nazis and white supremacists to deny them a platform to publicly spread their views. ""We are unapologetic about the reality that fighting fascism at points requires physical militancy,” Rose City Antifa’s Facebook page reads. “Anti-fascism is, by nature, a form of self-defense: the goal of fascism is to exterminate the vast majority of human beings.” Political activist and author Cornel West, speaking to Amy Goodman on the program Democracy Now about the clashes in Charlottesville, said antifa intervened when the ""neofascists"" move against his group of protesters. ""We would have been crushed like cockroaches if it were not for the anarchists and the anti-fascists,"" he said. Bray says the rise of fascism in the 1930s demonstrates that it was a mistake to allow such groups to air their views in hopes that public opinion would blunt their growth. ""We should be wary of those who are more distressed about alleged violations of the speech of fascists than the actual violence they perpetrate,"" he says. Where has the movement demonstrated? In addition to Charlottesville, antifa forces, who often dress in black and wear masks, have confronted or clashed with far-right groups in such places as the University of California at Berkeley, where protests by West Coast antifa forces, some of whom smashed windows and set fires, forced the cancellation of a speech by alt-right activist Milo Yiannopoulos in February and another by conservative commentator Ann Coulter in April. In June, antifa forces turned out to protest a pro-Trump free-speech in Portland. Some antifa counterprotesters began throwing objects at police, who responded with flash grenades and pepper balls, according to the The Oregonian. Antifa was also out in force in June to confront Patriot Prayer, a free speech group protesting “political correctness and hatred” at Evergreen State College in Olympia, Wash.",0.0
1622399862,2020-06-01 11:01:47,GUEST VIEW: Now is the time to take an oath to end racism,https://www.newportri.com/opinion/20200601/guest-view-now-is-time-to-take-oath-to-end-racism?rssfeed=true,en,False,,653261,Mercury - United States - Rhode Island,http://www.newportmercury.com/,"“Man’s inhumanity to man,” and “depraved indifference” are just two ways of describing what we have just seen in Minneapolis and, at a time, when unity and support of each other are so desperately needed. Many of us are shocked and dismayed. Still others aren’t surprised because the underbelly of racism and discrimination have manifested themselves in some form over thousands of years. Somehow, we always manage to find reasons and ways to demonstrate this ugly side of human nature. Certain ethnic and racial groups have been ostracized and persecuted on virtually every continent for centuries, based on ideology, religion, greed, power, fear, misunderstanding, and propaganda, etc. But, it would be an egregious error to relegate the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis to some expected occurrence in the historical ledger. We are talking about a human being whose life was unjustifiably terminated in the most cruel way by a person in authority. We cannot let this pass. We all must take a stand against such inhumane behavior. A lot has been said about “a police culture” that has allowed the killing and torture of African-Americans, and not just of late. There are many, many black individuals who have been victims of police brutality in our country over the past several years. Still, most reasonable people realize that the vast majority of police officers are not prejudiced nor do they commit or condone such unjustifiable violence. To the credit of the Providence Police Department, a statement has been made condemning the action of the Minneapolis policeman and his accomplices. I haven’t heard other departments in R.I. doing this, but I think all of them should be making the same, clear, decisive statement. However, it would not be entirely helpful to blame all of this racial unrest only on the “police culture.” There is plenty of evidence of racial discrimination in other elements of our society. We see it in practice in government, politics, business, schools and social groups. Right now we are facing the most challenging health crisis in a century with the COVID-19 pandemic. We really need to be joined in addressing it. And, we have seen some very heroic and compassionate behavior by a lot of people, notably in the healthcare field and first responders, including police. We really appreciate their efforts. But, this racial crisis runs much deeper and is a sickness for which this country never seems committed enough to cure. We simply haven’t thought it to be important enough to consider how profound a problem it really is nor have we devoted the time and energy to find remedies. Do we ever think about how it feels to be constantly worried about being subjected to biased attitudes and behavior almost every day of our lives? We always find a way to put off thinking that all of us have a responsibility to do something about racism. We do this through a process of dehumanization which allows (deludes) us into thinking that another person whose appearance is not the same as ours does not share the same humanity. We don’t identify ourselves with others who don’t share our “markings,” by race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, etc. They don’t look like us, so they can’t think and feel like us is the conclusion. Another delusion is that these biases just “show up,” when, in fact, they are learned attitudes and behaviors.They are subtly or not-so subtly taught at home and get reinforced by social groups in school and work and other places. I am sure that there are many other people who are like me and say, in the phrase of current advocacy, “Enough is enough!” We are fed up with doing nothing meaningful. We are outraged about the suffering and, even despair, visited upon not only African-Americans, but also on all people who cherish and embrace equality and justice. While expressing concern about injustice is fundamental to the American way of life, demonstrators are not justified in becoming violent by setting fires, looting and attacking police. They demean the injustice and, in this instance, dishonor the life and memory of Mr. Floyd and hundreds of other victims. We all have a duty, not just as citizens of the United States, but as members of the human race to respect the rights of others. We must have a system of values and a code of law that allow everyone to live freely in a fair and just society with equal opportunity to succeed. When the law is flaunted by law enforcement, chaos results. So, it can be said that the unlawful killing of African-Americans, notably by police officials, is disgraceful, immoral, abhorrent, unacceptable, and un-American.

1622406950,2020-06-01 10:47:10,Biden meets with black leaders at local church amid unrest,https://www.providencejournal.com/ZZ/news/20200601/biden-meets-with-black-leaders-at-local-church-amid-unrest?rssfeed=true,en,True,,68874,providencejournal.com,http://www.providencejournal.com/#spider,"WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) "" Joe Biden vowed to address institutional racism in his first 100 days in office as he sought to elevate his voice Monday in the exploding national debate over racism and police brutality. The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee offered emotional support and promised bold action during an in-person discussion with black leaders in Delaware and a subsequent virtual meeting with big-city mayors who are grappling with racial tensions and frustrated by a lack of federal support. 'Hate just hides. It doesn't go away, and when you have somebody in power who breathes oxygen into the hate under the rocks, it comes out from under the rocks,' Biden told more than a dozen African American leaders gathered at a church in downtown Wilmington, his face mask lowered around his chin as he spoke. Without offering specifics, he promised to 'deal with institutional racism' and set up a police oversight body in his first 100 days in office, if elected. The former vice president also said he'd be releasing an economic plan focused on education, housing and 'access to capital"" and investments, especially for minority Americans, later this month. 'I really do believe that the blinders have been taken off. I think this tidal wave is moving,' Biden told the mayors of Atlanta, Chicago, Los Angeles and St. Paul, Minnesota. 'I realize we've got to do something big, we can do it, and everyone will benefit from it.' Largely sheltering in place amid the coronavirus, Biden has struggled in recent weeks to be heard from his makeshift home TV studio over the noise of dueling national crises. But after another night of violent protests, he ventured out into public for the second time in two days and just the third time since the pandemic arrived in mid-March. His hopeful and collaborative approach marked a sharp contrast to that of President Donald Trump, who has made little effort to unify the country. The Republican president slammed governors as 'weak' during a video teleconference on Monday and demanded tougher crackdowns on protesters. Trump also lashed out at Biden on Twitter, writing that 'Sleepy Joe Biden's people are so Radical Left that they are working to get the Anarchists out of jail, and probably more.' Biden's softer style may foreshadow how he presents himself in the five months before the presidential election, emphasizing calm and competence as a contrast to a mercurial president. It is an approach that carries the risk of being drowned out by Trump's much louder voice. On Monday evening, Trump declared himself 'the president of law and order' from the White House as military police and law enforcement fired tear gas and cleared protesters from nearby Lafayette Park. Biden made no mention of the unfolding events during an online fundraiser that took place at the same time, though he talked at length about persistent racism in the U.S. He plans to deliver remarks on the unrest gripping the U.S. on Tuesday in Philadelphia. In the early moments of Monday's gathering at the Bethel AME church in Wilmington, Biden listened quietly and took notes. All the attendees, including Biden, wore face masks but lowered them as they spoke. 'The vice president came to hear from us. This is a homeboy,' pastor Sylvester Beaman said before everyone bowed their heads in prayer. Biden's standing with the black community weighs heavily as he works to deny Trump a second term. African Americans rescued Biden's flailing primary campaign, but it's unclear if they will turn out for him in large numbers in November. 'I want to make something clear. I don't expect anything from the black community,"" Biden said Monday, insisting he has never taken its support for granted. The former vice president has been doing cleanup since telling a prominent black radio host a week and a half ago that African Americans who back Trump 'ain't black.' Yet the mayors who spoke with Biden, three of whom are black, were clearly frustrated and angry with Trump, who has offered military support to address violent protests while denying them federal support to address the coronavirus fallout and repeatedly attacking them on social media. 'To see the president of the United States say that he's going to send the military into our communities but hadn't mentioned sending a single dime of support into our communities, speaks to where we are in America,' said Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms. Much of Biden's campaign strategy centers on trying to draw a contrast with Trump on temperament and values. He has called the White House contest a battle for the soul of the nation and has been particularly forceful in condemning Trump's handling of moments of racial tension. In an election that is likely to be a referendum on the sitting president, some Biden aides say privately that the best plan may be to let Trump do himself in. Yet there is also a recognition that Biden needs to do more than simply wait for voters who may be turned off by Trump to turn toward him. Some Democrats who have criticized Biden for not being more visible during the onset of the coronavirus said he is making the right moves now. 'I'm sure they have some reluctance, understandably, right now to politicize it. That's not who he is,"" said Democratic strategist James Carville. 'There might be a time for eloquence, but I think that simplicity is eloquence right now.' ___ Jaffe reported from Washington; Peoples reported from Montclair, New Jersey.

The movement has no unified structure or national leadership but has emerged in the form of local bodies nationwide, particularly on the West Coast. Some of the groups, such as the 10-year-old Rose City Antifa in Portland, the oldest antifa group in the U.S., are particularly well-organized and active online and on Facebook, while its members are individually anonymous. President Trump has singled out antifa as part of what he calls the alt-left in his initial claim that ""many sides"" were to blame for violence in Charlottesville the weekend of Aug. 12, not just the neo-Nazis, KKK and white nationalists. How is it pronounced? ""AN-tifa"" with the emphasis on the first syllable, which sounds more like ""on"" in English than ""an."" When did it start? Anti-fascist groups, particularly in Europe, have been around for many decades, notably in Italy, against Mussolini, and in Germany, against Hitler. In the postwar period, antifa groups resurged to fight neo-Nazi groups, particularly in Germany. In the U.S., the anti-fascist movements grew out of leftist politics of the late '80s, primarily under the umbrella of Anti-Racist Action. What does the movement want? The primary goal is to stop neo-Nazis and white supremacists from gaining a platform rather than to promote a specific antifa agenda. The antifa groups are decidedly anti-racist, anti-sexist and anti-homophobia, but also by and large socially leftist and anti-capitalist. How do the groups operate? Mark Bray, a lecturer and Dartmouth and author of the new book Antifa: The Antifascist Handbook, says the groups ""organize educational campaigns, build community coalitions, monitor fascists, pressure venues to cancel their events, organize self-defense trainings and physically confront the far right when necessary."" A main goal is to try to deny fascists a public forum, which is why they turn out in numbers to physically confront neo-Nazis, the KKK and white supremacists at public demonstrations. They also step in to protect counter-protesters at such events. In addition, antifa is particularly active in ""doxxing,"" or identifying neo-Nazis and like-minded individuals and disseminating that private information to the public and employers to discourage people from joining their ranks. Is antifa violent? Members pointedly do not eschew violence but rather see themselves as engaging in ""self-defense,"" protecting other protesters and primarily confronting neo-Nazis and white supremacists to deny them a platform to publicly spread their views. ""We are unapologetic about the reality that fighting fascism at points requires physical militancy,” Rose City Antifa’s Facebook page reads. “Anti-fascism is, by nature, a form of self-defense: the goal of fascism is to exterminate the vast majority of human beings.” Political activist and author Cornel West, speaking to Amy Goodman on the program Democracy Now about the clashes in Charlottesville, said antifa intervened when the ""neofascists"" move against his group of protesters. ""We would have been crushed like cockroaches if it were not for the anarchists and the anti-fascists,"" he said. Bray says the rise of fascism in the 1930s demonstrates that it was a mistake to allow such groups to air their views in hopes that public opinion would blunt their growth. ""We should be wary of those who are more distressed about alleged violations of the speech of fascists than the actual violence they perpetrate,"" he says. Where has the movement demonstrated? In addition to Charlottesville, antifa forces, who often dress in black and wear masks, have confronted or clashed with far-right groups in such places as the University of California at Berkeley, where protests by West Coast antifa forces, some of whom smashed windows and set fires, forced the cancellation of a speech by alt-right activist Milo Yiannopoulos in February and another by conservative commentator Ann Coulter in April. In June, antifa forces turned out to protest a pro-Trump free-speech in Portland. Some antifa counterprotesters began throwing objects at police, who responded with flash grenades and pepper balls, according to the The Oregonian. Antifa was also out in force in June to confront Patriot Prayer, a free speech group protesting “political correctness and hatred” at Evergreen State College in Olympia, Wash.",0.0

Many of us are shocked and dismayed. Still others aren’t surprised because the underbelly of racism and discrimination have manifested themselves in some form over thousands of years. Somehow, we always manage to find reasons and ways to demonstrate this ugly side of human nature. Certain ethnic and racial groups have been ostracized and persecuted on virtually every continent for centuries, based on ideology, religion, greed, power, fear, misunderstanding, and propaganda, etc. But, it would be an egregious error to relegate the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis to some expected occurrence in the historical ledger. We are talking about a human being whose life was unjustifiably terminated in the most cruel way by a person in authority. We cannot let this pass. We all must take a stand against such inhumane behavior. A lot has been said about “a police culture” that has allowed the killing and torture of African-Americans, and not just of late. There are many, many black individuals who have been victims of police brutality in our country over the past several years. Still, most reasonable people realize that the vast majority of police officers are not prejudiced nor do they commit or condone such unjustifiable violence. To the credit of the Providence Police Department, a statement has been made condemning the action of the Minneapolis policeman and his accomplices. I haven’t heard other departments in R.I. doing this, but I think all of them should be making the same, clear, decisive statement. However, it would not be entirely helpful to blame all of this racial unrest only on the “police culture.” There is plenty of evidence of racial discrimination in other elements of our society. We see it in practice in government, politics, business, schools and social groups. Right now we are facing the most challenging health crisis in a century with the COVID-19 pandemic. We really need to be joined in addressing it. And, we have seen some very heroic and compassionate behavior by a lot of people, notably in the healthcare field and first responders, including police. We really appreciate their efforts. But, this racial crisis runs much deeper and is a sickness for which this country never seems committed enough to cure. We simply haven’t thought it to be important enough to consider how profound a problem it really is nor have we devoted the time and energy to find remedies. Do we ever think about how it feels to be constantly worried about being subjected to biased attitudes and behavior almost every day of our lives? We always find a way to put off thinking that all of us have a responsibility to do something about racism. We do this through a process of dehumanization which allows (deludes) us into thinking that another person whose appearance is not the same as ours does not share the same humanity. We don’t identify ourselves with others who don’t share our “markings,” by race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, etc. They don’t look like us, so they can’t think and feel like us is the conclusion. Another delusion is that these biases just “show up,” when, in fact, they are learned attitudes and behaviors.They are subtly or not-so subtly taught at home and get reinforced by social groups in school and work and other places. I am sure that there are many other people who are like me and say, in the phrase of current advocacy, “Enough is enough!” We are fed up with doing nothing meaningful. We are outraged about the suffering and, even despair, visited upon not only African-Americans, but also on all people who cherish and embrace equality and justice. While expressing concern about injustice is fundamental to the American way of life, demonstrators are not justified in becoming violent by setting fires, looting and attacking police. They demean the injustice and, in this instance, dishonor the life and memory of Mr. Floyd and hundreds of other victims. We all have a duty, not just as citizens of the United States, but as members of the human race to respect the rights of others. We must have a system of values and a code of law that allow everyone to live freely in a fair and just society with equal opportunity to succeed. When the law is flaunted by law enforcement, chaos results. So, it can be said that the unlawful killing of African-Americans, notably by police officials, is disgraceful, immoral, abhorrent, unacceptable, and un-American. All individuals and groups should sincerely take an oath to end racism in any form starting today. Don’t this let go because this affects all of us. Racism is a pernicious evil that must be eradicated. We will be a better country if we stand up and do our part. J. Clement Cicilline is vice president of Newport County branch of the NAACP.",0.0

In addition to Charlottesville, antifa forces, who often dress in black and wear masks, have confronted or clashed with far-right groups in such places as the University of California at Berkeley, where protests by West Coast antifa forces, some of whom smashed windows and set fires, forced the cancellation of a speech by alt-right activist Milo Yiannopoulos in February and another by conservative commentator Ann Coulter in April. In June, antifa forces turned out to protest a pro-Trump free-speech in Portland. Some antifa counterprotesters began throwing objects at police, who responded with flash grenades and pepper balls, according to the The Oregonian. Antifa was also out in force in June to confront Patriot Prayer, a free speech group protesting “political correctness and hatred” at Evergreen State College in Olympia, Wash.",0.0
1622426030,2020-06-01 11:01:47,GUEST VIEW: Now is the time to take an oath to end racism,https://www.newportri.com/opinion/20200601/guest-view-now-is-time-to-take-oath-to-end-racism?rssfeed=true,en,False,,662951,Newport Life,http://www.newportlifemagazine.com/,"“Man’s inhumanity to man,” and “depraved indifference” are just two ways of describing what we have just seen in Minneapolis and, at a time, when unity and support of each other are so desperately needed. Many of us are shocked and dismayed. Still others aren’t surprised because the underbelly of racism and discrimination have manifested themselves in some form over thousands of years. Somehow, we always manage to find reasons and ways to demonstrate this ugly side of human nature. Certain ethnic and racial groups have been ostracized and persecuted on virtually every continent for centuries, based on ideology, religion, greed, power, fear, misunderstanding, and propaganda, etc. But, it would be an egregious error to relegate the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis to some expected occurrence in the historical ledger. We are talking about a human being whose life was unjustifiably terminated in the most cruel way by a person in authority. We cannot let this pass. We all must take a stand against such inhumane behavior. A lot has been said about “a police culture” that has allowed the killing and torture of African-Americans, and not just of late. There are many, many black individuals who have been victims of police brutality in our country over the past several years. Still, most reasonable people realize that the vast majority of police officers are not prejudiced nor do they commit or condone such unjustifiable violence. To the credit of the Providence Police Department, a statement has been made condemning the action of the Minneapolis policeman and his accomplices. I haven’t heard other departments in R.I. doing this, but I think all of them should be making the same, clear, decisive statement. However, it would not be entirely helpful to blame all of this racial unrest only on the “police culture.” There is plenty of evidence of racial discrimination in other elements of our society. We see it in practice in government, politics, business, schools and social groups. Right now we are facing the most challenging health crisis in a century with the COVID-19 pandemic. We really need to be joined in addressing it. And, we have seen some very heroic and compassionate behavior by a lot of people, notably in the healthcare field and first responders, including police. We really appreciate their efforts. But, this racial crisis runs much deeper and is a sickness for which this country never seems committed enough to cure. We simply haven’t thought it to be important enough to consider how profound a problem it really is nor have we devoted the time and energy to find remedies. Do we ever think about how it feels to be constantly worried about being subjected to biased attitudes and behavior almost every day of our lives? We always find a way to put off thinking that all of us have a responsibility to do something about racism. We do this through a process of dehumanization which allows (deludes) us into thinking that another person whose appearance is not the same as ours does not share the same humanity. We don’t identify ourselves with others who don’t share our “markings,” by race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, etc. They don’t look like us, so they can’t think and feel like us is the conclusion. Another delusion is that these biases just “show up,” when, in fact, they are learned attitudes and behaviors.They are subtly or not-so subtly taught at home and get reinforced by social groups in school and work and other places. I am sure that there are many other people who are like me and say, in the phrase of current advocacy, “Enough is enough!” We are fed up with doing nothing meaningful. We are outraged about the suffering and, even despair, visited upon not only African-Americans, but also on all people who cherish and embrace equality and justice. While expressing concern about injustice is fundamental to the American way of life, demonstrators are not justified in becoming violent by setting fires, looting and attacking police. They demean the injustice and, in this instance, dishonor the life and memory of Mr. Floyd and hundreds of other victims. We all have a duty, not just as citizens of the United States, but as members of the human race to respect the rights of others. We must have a system of values and a code of law that allow everyone to live freely in a fair and just society with equal opportunity to succeed. When the law is flaunted by law enforcement, chaos results. So, it can be said that the unlawful killing of African-Americans, notably by police officials, is disgraceful, immoral, abhorrent, unacceptable, and un-American. All individuals and groups should sincerely take an oath to end racism in any form starting today. Don’t this let go because this affects all of us. Racism is a pernicious evil that must be eradicated. We will be a better country if we stand up and do our part. J. Clement Cicilline is vice president of Newport County branch of the NAACP.",0.0
1622429674,2020-06-01 11:20:00,"Their stores were burned, ransacked and looted. What's next for Minneapolis-area small business owners in danger of losing livelihoods?",https://www.newportri.com/zz/news/20200601/their-stores-were-burned-ransacked-and-looted-whats-next-for-minneapolis-area-small-business-owners-in-danger-of-losing-livelihoods?rssfeed=true,en,False,,653261,Mercury - United States - Rhode Island,http://www.newportmercury.com/,"MINNEAPOLIS — Brandy Moore likened the charred remains of her south Minneapolis clothing store and recording studio to the pangs for equality that minorities here feel. Smoke continued to waft in the air 24 hours after people protesting the death of George Floyd lit fire to Moore's storefront, and several others along Lake Street. ""My business burned down two days ago, you see the flames? It's still going,"" Moore, 41, said Sunday. ""That flame down in people's soul? It's still going. They want justice."" She is among dozens of Minneapolis and St. Paul business owners, small and large, trying to rebuild after fiery riots and demonstrations in the Twin Cities on Thursday and Friday. Her company, ""Levels,"" which also has a St. Paul location that remains undamaged, was Moore's ""baby."" Moore, a black woman, said she started the business from the trunk of her car once she left a job with Minneapolis Public Schools in 2011 to pursue her passion for fashion and music. It had been opened for five years before people broke in Friday and started a fire that destroyed her business and several adjacent stores. When she was alerted to the break-in, Moore went to Lake Street and watched nearly a decade of work collapse into the concrete. ""I'm hurt that I lost this. But ... I can't cry right now,"" she said. ""I can't go home and cry and be hurt because I lost businesses. George Floyd lost his life. He'll never be here again."" She's confident she can recover but isn't sure if she can rebuild at the same location — in the heart of a diverse southside neighborhood. A GoFundMe has been started to help with those expenses. Other small businesses face similar uncertainty, but several fundraisers have been started to help support Minneapolis' littlest companies. As looters ransacked his St. Paul store, this business owner hid in the bathroom and whispered to 911 In St. Paul's Midway neighborhood, just blocks from where Moore's second Levels location was protected by armed men standing on its porch, one business owner said he hid in his office as people ransacked, urinated in and damaged the building. Jim Segal closed Ax-Man Surplus earlier than normal Thursday afternoon because daylight looting took hold at the nearby intersection of University and Snelling avenues. After sending customers and employees home and locking the front door, Segal said he continued to work in the office of the six-decade-old company. Then he heard multiple glass windows break. ""Luckily, I have a steel door because they were trying to enter the office,"" said Segal, who bought the surplus store about 20 years ago. ""I don't think they knew anybody was in there, but I basically barricaded myself within a bathroom inside the office."" He felt as if he were in a movie, the St. Paul native said. As display cases were shattered and electronics taken from inside his store, he whispered to 911 dispatch asking for help. ""Police said, 'Don't even bother boarding up your store,'"" Segal said Saturday. ""'There's a 50/50 chance it won't be here tomorrow."" About 6:30 p.m. Thursday, he returned to the St. Paul Ax-Man location, one of three in the metro, in an unsuccessful effort to shoo away people running in and out of his store. A company agreed to board up his windows, Segal said, but left quickly after arriving, not wanting to work amongst the crowd. He tried to get a license plate of someone stealing, but others tried to take his phone so he retreated to his car. Segal sat in his vehicle for hours as rioters peed in his store and took items ranging from knick-knacks and DVDs to a snow-blower. He said coronavirus concerns forced him to close his business for the better part of two months. They'd been reopened a little more than a week when the building was ransacked. ""I don't recall ever being in a situation where I was that panicked. I was petrified, actually,"" he said. Ax-Man won't reopen for at least a week or two, and Segal fears it may close permanently because of the lack of sales during the spring. That would mean a loss of livelihood for him and about 10 employees. He sympathizes with those upset about Floyd's death in police custody on Memorial Day, describing the video of Minneapolis police officers' actions ""horrific."" ""This is just stuff, no comparison (to a person dying),"" said Segal, a white man. ""But what I'm disappointed about is the lack of leadership in the government — Mayor (Melvin) Carter, Mayor (Jacob) Frey, Gov. (Tim) Walz — to just allow lawlessness. ""Indefensible what happened to Mr. Floyd, but this doesn't make it better. And I don't know what does."" Insurance helps small business owners, but a full recovery is 'a lot more complicated' While Moore and Segal both said they are insured, they don't believe insurance alone will enough to replace everything they've lost. People typically see business owner and think ""wealth,"" Segal said. ""That's not true for me,"" he said. ""I'm the last one to get paid."" Understanding insurance policies can be difficult for many small business owners, said Allison Sharkey, executive director of the Lake Street Council, which supports local companies. Lake Street has always been an area for Minneapolis's immigrant entrepreneurs to start businesses, she said, and many of those folks may not be familiar with aid systems or insurance proceedings. ""There's a lot of detail to go through in your contract that most people don't really understand until a situation like this happens,"" Sharkey said. ""It's a lot more complicated than just paying a $500 deductible and thinking the rest is going to be covered."" Minority business owners may not have the credit or assets to withstand closures as long as white business owners with more resources, she said. The council, and other metro business associations like it, try to fill that gap and provide guidance, but insurance claims won't stop some businesses from completely fading away. For Moore, she's frustrated when people bring up the fact she's insured because it ignores the work she put into the building and the items she won't get back. ""When you get it out the mud — meaning when you get it on your own, no handouts ... someone just handing you money doesn't equate,"" she said. ""It's deeper than that."" Financial support is coming for Twin Cities small businesses left in rubble amid George Floyd protests When Segal returned to his business Friday, he found a person who lived nearby sweeping glass from the sidewalk, which raised his spirits. Monetary support has begun, too. It's especially vital, small business advocates say, because many companies were already running out of money because of closures due to COVID-19. The Lake Street Council has received over $1.5 million to help support the hundreds of businesses that line the heavily damaged area. Sharkey said companies owned by people of color and immigrants have been especially affected by the days of unrest. Several ""big, beautiful"" buildings on the southside have been replaced by rubble, which will be eventually replaced by vacant lots. ""($1.5 million) sounds like a big number, but we're gonna need a lot more government and nonprofit support,"" Sharkey said. ""We have a long road ahead of us."" She said her organization had already begun to save money to distribute to companies dealing with financial contractions from the coronavirus, but it's not been shifted to riot recovery. The council will request an aid package from the state, but Sharkey thinks they'll need federal dollars as well. ""We're headed toward a recession,"" she said. ""We're really going to have to create a long-term strategy along with stakeholders, business owners, property owners business groups, elected officials."" Donations to that fund can be made here. Fundraising has begun in Segal's area, as well. The Hamline Midway Coalition has received more than $75,000 to help aid small businesses in their recovery from property damage and lost sales. Kate Mudge, the coalition's director, said the organization has been raising funds to help small and minority business owners worried about gentrification and corporatization coming with the new U.S. soccer stadium built nearby. ""We already have been dealing with a pandemic, we've been dealing with some long-term issues in our community, and this is the icing on the cake. We hope that this is gonna bring new people to Midway, new businesses,"" she said. ""We've dealt with worse."" Donations to the Midway fund can be made at here. Despite the uncertainty, the organizations are confident many businesses will survive if community support keeps up. ""I'm not blaming people, you can't judge anybody's pain or anger. Everyone acts and reacts to things in different ways,"" Moore said. ""I have a black-owned business, it was burned down and we were protesting, for a black man's life that was taken. So, I was just a little confused on where we're going with this. But, at the end of the day, everything is about sacrifices.""",0.0

Most demonstrations, some attracting hundreds of people, were peaceful though violence, including the burning of police vehicles and looting, prompted police in some cities to deploy tear gas to gain control of the crowd. Early in the day, volunteers turned out in many cities to sweep up debris from businesses that had been burned, had their windows broken or were otherwise damaged Saturday. Here's a look at how protests are unfolding around the country on Sunday: Washington, D.C.: Historic St. John's Church near White House set ablaze As protesters gathered near the White House, flames were seen at the Washington, D.C., landmark that bills itself as ""the church of the presidents."" The fire, apparently an act of arson, was in the basement of St. John's Church, across from the White House, The Washington Post reported, and was extinguished. It occurred as a demonstration was taking place outside. The gathering had attracted as many as 1,000 Sunday, who faced off against officers in riot gear. The Episcopalian church in Lafayette Square boasts on its website that every U.S. president since James Madison has attended services there. Consecrated in 1816, the church also says the bell in its steeple, weighing almost 1,000 pounds, was cast in 1822 by Paul Revere's son Joseph. New York City: Protesters force closure of Manhattan Bridge; street fires, looting A crucial bridge into Manhattan was closed Sunday to make way for protesters, a day after hundreds of arrests including the mayor's daughter, it was reported. Street fires were being set and sporadic looting was reported Sunday evening after a day that saw large groups of protesters walk from Brooklyn to Manhattan over the Manhattan Bridge, which had to be closed, ABC7 in New York reported. Mayor Bill de Blasio's daughter Chiara, 25, was among 345 arrested, the station reported based on unnamed NYPD sources. The Daily Mail said it was able to confirm the arrest from a police report. She was reportedly arrested as part of a group of 100 demonstrators who refused to leave a roadway when ordered by police. Seattle: National Guard called to Bellevue; protesters block Interstate 5 National Guard troops were ordered to the Seattle suburb of Bellevue after reports of widespread looting. Washington Gov. Jay Inslee ordered 200 National Guard members to Bellevue after the mayor declared an emergency due to violence. Rioters broke into the Bellevue Mall and were stealing goods from stores. The thefts were part of a day of protests in the Seattle area that included shutting down Interstate 5, the same freeway that San Diego demonstrators blocked more than 1,000 miles away in southern California. Chicago: Gov. JB Pritzker activates National Guardsmen to assist police Vandalism reports continued to crop up in several city neighborhoods and some suburbs. The communities of Tinley Park, Crestwood and Oak Lawn alerted residents to stay home due to civil unrest. Many businesses boarded up. Gov. J.B. Pritzker said he activated 375 Illinois National Guard soldiers to assist local law enforcement with street closures. The downtown Chicago demonstrations that drew thousands started peacefully Saturday afternoon in a plaza, with protesters reading the names of black people who have died at the hands of police. But that gave way to violence and destruction that continued overnight Sunday in Chicago and elsewhere. Police used batons to beat back demonstrators as police cars were set ablaze and windows were smashed at businesses ranging from neighborhood convenience stores to high-end Michigan Avenue shops. Santa Monica, California: Unchecked looting as marchers confront police Looters took advantage of a large demonstration several blocks away to hit stores in the city's business district. In late afternoon, police were met with resistance when they tried to end a demonstration that had been peaceful. Demonstrators constructed a makeshift barricade in the middle of a street to protect themselves from non-lethal rounds fired by officers. The march had attracted hundreds along the city's main oceanfront boulevard. Though there were many police officers present for the march, looters were able to plunder stores with few to stop them. Cars were seen pulling up in front of stores, with looters running in to collect bundles of clothes and other merchandise, then running out. Boxes littered the sidewalk as thieves were seen transferring goods into plastic trash bags. A 5:30 p.m. PST curfew was announced due to the protests. The looting came despite the arrival of the National Guard troops in neighboring Los Angeles, which had seen extensive looting, vandalism and arson on Saturday. Murfreesboro, Tennessee: Brick thrown into business, police use tear gas A small but tense demonstration in Murfreesboro, Tennessee, appeared to have dispersed after demonstrators blocked traffic and threw a brick through the window of a local business, prompting police to respond with canisters of tear gas. About 50 protesters, many of whom appeared to be Middle Tennessee State University students, marched from Main Street toward Forrest Hall, a campus building named for Confederate general and Ku Klux Klan founder Nathan Bedford Forrest. Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee said protests in Murfreesboro are now “overt threats to public safety and property.” Police said an armored vehicle was vandalized and protesters have blocked traffic by lying in the street in an intersection. Officers responded by throwing canisters of tear gas to drive protesters out of the street. However, before the protest escalated, negotiations between police and protest leaders led to calm, then students and officers were seen walking together and posing for photos. – Nancy DeGennaro, Joseph Spears, Mealand Ragland-Hudgins and Brinley Hineman, Murfreesboro Daily News Journal Savannah, Georgia: Protesters chant 'Arrest the other three' during rally Thousands demonstrated against racism and the killings of black people at the hands of police Sunday in Savannah, Georgia. City leaders joined protesters who peacefully marched from Johnson Square to City Hall. “We need to make sure that we stop apologizing and we move from apology to action,” Savannah Police Chief Roy Minter said. At one point during Mayor Van Johnson’s speech, the crowd broke into a chant of “arrest the other three,” referring to other Minneapolis police officers who stood by while an officer knelt on Floyd’s neck. “Yeah, they should arrest the other three,” Johnson said. “We are tired of the mess and we want it to stop now. We stand here as a united community to say that we are standing with George Floyd and his family, because no man should ever have to die like that,” Johnson said. “We stand here united as a community to say that crooked police officers are called criminals. And in jail, they should be.” – Will Peebles, Dennis Knight, Mary Landers, Nathan Dominitz and Zach Dennis, Savannah Morning News San Diego: Police fire tear gas after being assaulted by rocks and bottles San Diego Police said they fired tear gas canisters Sunday after rocks and bottles were thrown at them. The department said in a series of tweets that the confrontation was taking place at Second Avenue and Broadway in the seaside city's downtown. ""Certain protestors continue to throw objects and vandalize our city,"" the department said in one post. ""The criminal behavior of these few is unacceptable. We are continuing to order the crowd to disperse."" Earlier, however, the department praised the peacefulness of most demonstrators. But it said it had to issue the order to disperse because of the dangerous actions of a few. At one point, demonstrators occupied Interstate 5, stopping traffic in both directions, the San Diego Union-Tribune reported. Philadelphia: Mayor Jim Kenney 'saddened and disappointed' beyond words Another day of street protests gave way to looting, with at least one police vehicle set on fire. Looters were running out of stores in the northeastern section of the city with armloads of merchandise. In the downtown, workers and volunteers swept up broken glass from windows shattered during riots the previous day. Graffiti was being removed. Mayor Jim Kenney said the mayhem “saddened and disappointed me beyond words, and I’m sure it saddened every Philadelphian who takes pride in their city.” He said those responsible “not only desecrated private businesses, they also desecrated the important message that was heard in the earlier peaceful protests.” Spartanburg, South Carolina: Passing motorists show support for protesters Chanting “No justice, no peace,” about 100 peaceful Spartanburg, South Carolina, protesters gathered at Barnet Park, drawing support from motorists who honked their car horns. “We want to take a peaceful stand to show support,” said organizer Kelvin Brown. “If we can all come together as a people, black and white, we can make a difference.” Many protesters said it wasn’t just Floyd’s death at the hand of a white police officer, or that it took days before the officer was arrested, that triggered anger. “We need to end the racist system,” said Curtis Pickens. “If you want all this to stop, real justice is what is needed. Stop the racial and social profiling.

The protest, peaceful like others in Baton Rouge and New Orleans this weekend, began in the morning with protesters lining the streets to chant. “I am sick and tired of being sick and tired,” Lafayette NAACP President Marja Broussard said to protesters. “I have a message for law enforcement. The message is: we want you to know that we’re human just like you...We want you to know we have families. We’re human.” – William Taylor Potter, Lafayette Daily Advertiser Augusta, Georgia: Demonstrators chant 'No justice, no peace' Demonstrators chanted “no justice, no peace” as they walked along Washington Road in Augusta, Georgia. While “No justice, no peace,” was a popular chant among protesters, Sunday’s peaceful march was about showing strength through peace rather than through violence, organizers said. Latoya Lovett said she asked the Street Justice Council to help her organize the marches after hearing many Augusta residents talk about going to Atlanta to join protests there, which have turned violent after peaceful starts. “You can march in your own city, you can have a voice in your own city,” Lovett said. “You don’t have to go smash windows, you don’t have to go beat people, you don’t have to drop on the police.” Demonstrators were escorted by Richmond County Sheriff’s Office deputies who blocked off roads and intersections as needed. Sheriff Richard Roundtree was among those who helped guide the marchers and ensure safety for both them and the motorists. “We believe in free speech and protesting and voicing your opinion, as long as you do it in a safe manner,” Roundtree said. “As long as you’re doing that, we’re all for it.” – Will Cheney and Miguel Legoas, The Augusta Chronicle Jacksonville, Florida: Peaceful rally follows violent Saturday night of protests A peaceful demonstration was held Sunday outside the Duval County Courthouse. Then protesters started moving downtown and Jacksonville, Florida, police worked to keep them in certain areas. The cleanup of smashed store windows began Sunday around Florida after a night of unrest throughout the state’s cities. Jacksonville Sheriff Mike Williams said an unnamed deputy was either stabbed or slashed in the neck and was taken to a hospital for treatment Saturday night. A sheriff’s office spokeswoman would not comment on the deputy’s condition Sunday morning. A protest Saturday resulted in many arrests, “but we still don’t know how many or anything related to those arrests,” the sheriff said. – Sarasota News-Tribune Cincinnati: Police make 100 arrests after urging protesters to go home Police arrested as many as 100 people after using tear gas and imploring the crowd to go home ahead of a curfew.

What's next for Minneapolis-area small business owners in danger of losing livelihoods?",https://www.newportri.com/zz/news/20200601/their-stores-were-burned-ransacked-and-looted-whats-next-for-minneapolis-area-small-business-owners-in-danger-of-losing-livelihoods?rssfeed=true,en,False,,662951,Newport Life,http://www.newportlifemagazine.com/,"MINNEAPOLIS — Brandy Moore likened the charred remains of her south Minneapolis clothing store and recording studio to the pangs for equality that minorities here feel. Smoke continued to waft in the air 24 hours after people protesting the death of George Floyd lit fire to Moore's storefront, and several others along Lake Street. ""My business burned down two days ago, you see the flames? It's still going,"" Moore, 41, said Sunday. ""That flame down in people's soul? It's still going. They want justice."" She is among dozens of Minneapolis and St. Paul business owners, small and large, trying to rebuild after fiery riots and demonstrations in the Twin Cities on Thursday and Friday. Her company, ""Levels,"" which also has a St. Paul location that remains undamaged, was Moore's ""baby."" Moore, a black woman, said she started the business from the trunk of her car once she left a job with Minneapolis Public Schools in 2011 to pursue her passion for fashion and music. It had been opened for five years before people broke in Friday and started a fire that destroyed her business and several adjacent stores. When she was alerted to the break-in, Moore went to Lake Street and watched nearly a decade of work collapse into the concrete. ""I'm hurt that I lost this. But ... I can't cry right now,"" she said. ""I can't go home and cry and be hurt because I lost businesses. George Floyd lost his life. He'll never be here again."" She's confident she can recover but isn't sure if she can rebuild at the same location — in the heart of a diverse southside neighborhood. A GoFundMe has been started to help with those expenses. Other small businesses face similar uncertainty, but several fundraisers have been started to help support Minneapolis' littlest companies. As looters ransacked his St. Paul store, this business owner hid in the bathroom and whispered to 911 In St. Paul's Midway neighborhood, just blocks from where Moore's second Levels location was protected by armed men standing on its porch, one business owner said he hid in his office as people ransacked, urinated in and damaged the building. Jim Segal closed Ax-Man Surplus earlier than normal Thursday afternoon because daylight looting took hold at the nearby intersection of University and Snelling avenues. After sending customers and employees home and locking the front door, Segal said he continued to work in the office of the six-decade-old company. Then he heard multiple glass windows break. ""Luckily, I have a steel door because they were trying to enter the office,"" said Segal, who bought the surplus store about 20 years ago. ""I don't think they knew anybody was in there, but I basically barricaded myself within a bathroom inside the office."" He felt as if he were in a movie, the St. Paul native said. As display cases were shattered and electronics taken from inside his store, he whispered to 911 dispatch asking for help. ""Police said, 'Don't even bother boarding up your store,'"" Segal said Saturday. ""'There's a 50/50 chance it won't be here tomorrow."" About 6:30 p.m. Thursday, he returned to the St. Paul Ax-Man location, one of three in the metro, in an unsuccessful effort to shoo away people running in and out of his store. A company agreed to board up his windows, Segal said, but left quickly after arriving, not wanting to work amongst the crowd. He tried to get a license plate of someone stealing, but others tried to take his phone so he retreated to his car. Segal sat in his vehicle for hours as rioters peed in his store and took items ranging from knick-knacks and DVDs to a snow-blower. He said coronavirus concerns forced him to close his business for the better part of two months. They'd been reopened a little more than a week when the building was ransacked. ""I don't recall ever being in a situation where I was that panicked. I was petrified, actually,"" he said. Ax-Man won't reopen for at least a week or two, and Segal fears it may close permanently because of the lack of sales during the spring. That would mean a loss of livelihood for him and about 10 employees. He sympathizes with those upset about Floyd's death in police custody on Memorial Day, describing the video of Minneapolis police officers' actions ""horrific."" ""This is just stuff, no comparison (to a person dying),"" said Segal, a white man. ""But what I'm disappointed about is the lack of leadership in the government — Mayor (Melvin) Carter, Mayor (Jacob) Frey, Gov. (Tim) Walz — to just allow lawlessness. ""Indefensible what happened to Mr. Floyd, but this doesn't make it better. And I don't know what does."" Insurance helps small business owners, but a full recovery is 'a lot more complicated' While Moore and Segal both said they are insured, they don't believe insurance alone will enough to replace everything they've lost. People typically see business owner and think ""wealth,"" Segal said. ""That's not true for me,"" he said. ""I'm the last one to get paid."" Understanding insurance policies can be difficult for many small business owners, said Allison Sharkey, executive director of the Lake Street Council, which supports local companies. Lake Street has always been an area for Minneapolis's immigrant entrepreneurs to start businesses, she said, and many of those folks may not be familiar with aid systems or insurance proceedings. ""There's a lot of detail to go through in your contract that most people don't really understand until a situation like this happens,"" Sharkey said. ""It's a lot more complicated than just paying a $500 deductible and thinking the rest is going to be covered."" Minority business owners may not have the credit or assets to withstand closures as long as white business owners with more resources, she said. The council, and other metro business associations like it, try to fill that gap and provide guidance, but insurance claims won't stop some businesses from completely fading away. For Moore, she's frustrated when people bring up the fact she's insured because it ignores the work she put into the building and the items she won't get back. ""When you get it out the mud — meaning when you get it on your own, no handouts ... someone just handing you money doesn't equate,"" she said. ""It's deeper than that."" Financial support is coming for Twin Cities small businesses left in rubble amid George Floyd protests When Segal returned to his business Friday, he found a person who lived nearby sweeping glass from the sidewalk, which raised his spirits. Monetary support has begun, too. It's especially vital, small business advocates say, because many companies were already running out of money because of closures due to COVID-19. The Lake Street Council has received over $1.5 million to help support the hundreds of businesses that line the heavily damaged area. Sharkey said companies owned by people of color and immigrants have been especially affected by the days of unrest. Several ""big, beautiful"" buildings on the southside have been replaced by rubble, which will be eventually replaced by vacant lots. ""($1.5 million) sounds like a big number, but we're gonna need a lot more government and nonprofit support,"" Sharkey said. ""We have a long road ahead of us."" She said her organization had already begun to save money to distribute to companies dealing with financial contractions from the coronavirus, but it's not been shifted to riot recovery. The council will request an aid package from the state, but Sharkey thinks they'll need federal dollars as well. ""We're headed toward a recession,"" she said. ""We're really going to have to create a long-term strategy along with stakeholders, business owners, property owners business groups, elected officials."" Donations to that fund can be made here. Fundraising has begun in Segal's area, as well. The Hamline Midway Coalition has received more than $75,000 to help aid small businesses in their recovery from property damage and lost sales. Kate Mudge, the coalition's director, said the organization has been raising funds to help small and minority business owners worried about gentrification and corporatization coming with the new U.S. soccer stadium built nearby. ""We already have been dealing with a pandemic, we've been dealing with some long-term issues in our community, and this is the icing on the cake. We hope that this is gonna bring new people to Midway, new businesses,"" she said. ""We've dealt with worse."" Donations to the Midway fund can be made at here. Despite the uncertainty, the organizations are confident many businesses will survive if community support keeps up. ""I'm not blaming people, you can't judge anybody's pain or anger. Everyone acts and reacts to things in different ways,"" Moore said. ""I have a black-owned business, it was burned down and we were protesting, for a black man's life that was taken. So, I was just a little confused on where we're going with this. But, at the end of the day, everything is about sacrifices.""",0.0

Most demonstrations, some attracting hundreds of people, were peaceful though violence, including the burning of police vehicles and looting, prompted police in some cities to deploy tear gas to gain control of the crowd. Early in the day, volunteers turned out in many cities to sweep up debris from businesses that had been burned, had their windows broken or were otherwise damaged Saturday. Here's a look at how protests are unfolding around the country on Sunday: Washington, D.C.: Historic St. John's Church near White House set ablaze As protesters gathered near the White House, flames were seen at the Washington, D.C., landmark that bills itself as ""the church of the presidents."" The fire, apparently an act of arson, was in the basement of St. John's Church, across from the White House, The Washington Post reported, and was extinguished. It occurred as a demonstration was taking place outside. The gathering had attracted as many as 1,000 Sunday, who faced off against officers in riot gear. The Episcopalian church in Lafayette Square boasts on its website that every U.S. president since James Madison has attended services there. Consecrated in 1816, the church also says the bell in its steeple, weighing almost 1,000 pounds, was cast in 1822 by Paul Revere's son Joseph. New York City: Protesters force closure of Manhattan Bridge; street fires, looting A crucial bridge into Manhattan was closed Sunday to make way for protesters, a day after hundreds of arrests including the mayor's daughter, it was reported. Street fires were being set and sporadic looting was reported Sunday evening after a day that saw large groups of protesters walk from Brooklyn to Manhattan over the Manhattan Bridge, which had to be closed, ABC7 in New York reported. Mayor Bill de Blasio's daughter Chiara, 25, was among 345 arrested, the station reported based on unnamed NYPD sources. The Daily Mail said it was able to confirm the arrest from a police report. She was reportedly arrested as part of a group of 100 demonstrators who refused to leave a roadway when ordered by police. Seattle: National Guard called to Bellevue; protesters block Interstate 5 National Guard troops were ordered to the Seattle suburb of Bellevue after reports of widespread looting. Washington Gov. Jay Inslee ordered 200 National Guard members to Bellevue after the mayor declared an emergency due to violence. Rioters broke into the Bellevue Mall and were stealing goods from stores. The thefts were part of a day of protests in the Seattle area that included shutting down Interstate 5, the same freeway that San Diego demonstrators blocked more than 1,000 miles away in southern California. Chicago: Gov. JB Pritzker activates National Guardsmen to assist police Vandalism reports continued to crop up in several city neighborhoods and some suburbs. The communities of Tinley Park, Crestwood and Oak Lawn alerted residents to stay home due to civil unrest. Many businesses boarded up. Gov. J.B. Pritzker said he activated 375 Illinois National Guard soldiers to assist local law enforcement with street closures. The downtown Chicago demonstrations that drew thousands started peacefully Saturday afternoon in a plaza, with protesters reading the names of black people who have died at the hands of police. But that gave way to violence and destruction that continued overnight Sunday in Chicago and elsewhere. Police used batons to beat back demonstrators as police cars were set ablaze and windows were smashed at businesses ranging from neighborhood convenience stores to high-end Michigan Avenue shops. Santa Monica, California: Unchecked looting as marchers confront police Looters took advantage of a large demonstration several blocks away to hit stores in the city's business district. In late afternoon, police were met with resistance when they tried to end a demonstration that had been peaceful. Demonstrators constructed a makeshift barricade in the middle of a street to protect themselves from non-lethal rounds fired by officers. The march had attracted hundreds along the city's main oceanfront boulevard. Though there were many police officers present for the march, looters were able to plunder stores with few to stop them. Cars were seen pulling up in front of stores, with looters running in to collect bundles of clothes and other merchandise, then running out. Boxes littered the sidewalk as thieves were seen transferring goods into plastic trash bags. A 5:30 p.m. PST curfew was announced due to the protests. The looting came despite the arrival of the National Guard troops in neighboring Los Angeles, which had seen extensive looting, vandalism and arson on Saturday. Murfreesboro, Tennessee: Brick thrown into business, police use tear gas A small but tense demonstration in Murfreesboro, Tennessee, appeared to have dispersed after demonstrators blocked traffic and threw a brick through the window of a local business, prompting police to respond with canisters of tear gas. About 50 protesters, many of whom appeared to be Middle Tennessee State University students, marched from Main Street toward Forrest Hall, a campus building named for Confederate general and Ku Klux Klan founder Nathan Bedford Forrest. Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee said protests in Murfreesboro are now “overt threats to public safety and property.” Police said an armored vehicle was vandalized and protesters have blocked traffic by lying in the street in an intersection. Officers responded by throwing canisters of tear gas to drive protesters out of the street. However, before the protest escalated, negotiations between police and protest leaders led to calm, then students and officers were seen walking together and posing for photos. – Nancy DeGennaro, Joseph Spears, Mealand Ragland-Hudgins and Brinley Hineman, Murfreesboro Daily News Journal Savannah, Georgia: Protesters chant 'Arrest the other three' during rally Thousands demonstrated against racism and the killings of black people at the hands of police Sunday in Savannah, Georgia. City leaders joined protesters who peacefully marched from Johnson Square to City Hall. “We need to make sure that we stop apologizing and we move from apology to action,” Savannah Police Chief Roy Minter said. At one point during Mayor Van Johnson’s speech, the crowd broke into a chant of “arrest the other three,” referring to other Minneapolis police officers who stood by while an officer knelt on Floyd’s neck. “Yeah, they should arrest the other three,” Johnson said. “We are tired of the mess and we want it to stop now. We stand here as a united community to say that we are standing with George Floyd and his family, because no man should ever have to die like that,” Johnson said. “We stand here united as a community to say that crooked police officers are called criminals. And in jail, they should be.” – Will Peebles, Dennis Knight, Mary Landers, Nathan Dominitz and Zach Dennis, Savannah Morning News San Diego: Police fire tear gas after being assaulted by rocks and bottles San Diego Police said they fired tear gas canisters Sunday after rocks and bottles were thrown at them. The department said in a series of tweets that the confrontation was taking place at Second Avenue and Broadway in the seaside city's downtown. ""Certain protestors continue to throw objects and vandalize our city,"" the department said in one post. ""The criminal behavior of these few is unacceptable. We are continuing to order the crowd to disperse."" Earlier, however, the department praised the peacefulness of most demonstrators. But it said it had to issue the order to disperse because of the dangerous actions of a few. At one point, demonstrators occupied Interstate 5, stopping traffic in both directions, the San Diego Union-Tribune reported. Philadelphia: Mayor Jim Kenney 'saddened and disappointed' beyond words Another day of street protests gave way to looting, with at least one police vehicle set on fire. Looters were running out of stores in the northeastern section of the city with armloads of merchandise. In the downtown, workers and volunteers swept up broken glass from windows shattered during riots the previous day. Graffiti was being removed. Mayor Jim Kenney said the mayhem “saddened and disappointed me beyond words, and I’m sure it saddened every Philadelphian who takes pride in their city.” He said those responsible “not only desecrated private businesses, they also desecrated the important message that was heard in the earlier peaceful protests.” Spartanburg, South Carolina: Passing motorists show support for protesters Chanting “No justice, no peace,” about 100 peaceful Spartanburg, South Carolina, protesters gathered at Barnet Park, drawing support from motorists who honked their car horns. “We want to take a peaceful stand to show support,” said organizer Kelvin Brown. “If we can all come together as a people, black and white, we can make a difference.” Many protesters said it wasn’t just Floyd’s death at the hand of a white police officer, or that it took days before the officer was arrested, that triggered anger. “We need to end the racist system,” said Curtis Pickens. “If you want all this to stop, real justice is what is needed. Stop the racial and social profiling. Stop hiring white supremacist officers.” “It’s time to stand up for what we believe in,” Isaiah Jordan said. “What happened to George Floyd terrorizes the whole nation. We’ve got to do something about it.

So, I was just a little confused on where we're going with this. But, at the end of the day, everything is about sacrifices.""",0.0

Most demonstrations, some attracting hundreds of people, were peaceful though violence, including the burning of police vehicles and looting, prompted police in some cities to deploy tear gas to gain control of the crowd. Early in the day, volunteers turned out in many cities to sweep up debris from businesses that had been burned, had their windows broken or were otherwise damaged Saturday. Here's a look at how protests are unfolding around the country on Sunday: Washington, D.C.: Historic St. John's Church near White House set ablaze As protesters gathered near the White House, flames were seen at the Washington, D.C., landmark that bills itself as ""the church of the presidents."" The fire, apparently an act of arson, was in the basement of St. John's Church, across from the White House, The Washington Post reported, and was extinguished. It occurred as a demonstration was taking place outside. The gathering had attracted as many as 1,000 Sunday, who faced off against officers in riot gear. The Episcopalian church in Lafayette Square boasts on its website that every U.S. president since James Madison has attended services there. Consecrated in 1816, the church also says the bell in its steeple, weighing almost 1,000 pounds, was cast in 1822 by Paul Revere's son Joseph. New York City: Protesters force closure of Manhattan Bridge; street fires, looting A crucial bridge into Manhattan was closed Sunday to make way for protesters, a day after hundreds of arrests including the mayor's daughter, it was reported. Street fires were being set and sporadic looting was reported Sunday evening after a day that saw large groups of protesters walk from Brooklyn to Manhattan over the Manhattan Bridge, which had to be closed, ABC7 in New York reported. Mayor Bill de Blasio's daughter Chiara, 25, was among 345 arrested, the station reported based on unnamed NYPD sources. The Daily Mail said it was able to confirm the arrest from a police report. She was reportedly arrested as part of a group of 100 demonstrators who refused to leave a roadway when ordered by police. Seattle: National Guard called to Bellevue; protesters block Interstate 5 National Guard troops were ordered to the Seattle suburb of Bellevue after reports of widespread looting. Washington Gov. Jay Inslee ordered 200 National Guard members to Bellevue after the mayor declared an emergency due to violence. Rioters broke into the Bellevue Mall and were stealing goods from stores. The thefts were part of a day of protests in the Seattle area that included shutting down Interstate 5, the same freeway that San Diego demonstrators blocked more than 1,000 miles away in southern California. Chicago: Gov. JB Pritzker activates National Guardsmen to assist police Vandalism reports continued to crop up in several city neighborhoods and some suburbs. The communities of Tinley Park, Crestwood and Oak Lawn alerted residents to stay home due to civil unrest. Many businesses boarded up. Gov. J.B. Pritzker said he activated 375 Illinois National Guard soldiers to assist local law enforcement with street closures. The downtown Chicago demonstrations that drew thousands started peacefully Saturday afternoon in a plaza, with protesters reading the names of black people who have died at the hands of police. But that gave way to violence and destruction that continued overnight Sunday in Chicago and elsewhere. Police used batons to beat back demonstrators as police cars were set ablaze and windows were smashed at businesses ranging from neighborhood convenience stores to high-end Michigan Avenue shops. Santa Monica, California: Unchecked looting as marchers confront police Looters took advantage of a large demonstration several blocks away to hit stores in the city's business district. In late afternoon, police were met with resistance when they tried to end a demonstration that had been peaceful. Demonstrators constructed a makeshift barricade in the middle of a street to protect themselves from non-lethal rounds fired by officers. The march had attracted hundreds along the city's main oceanfront boulevard. Though there were many police officers present for the march, looters were able to plunder stores with few to stop them. Cars were seen pulling up in front of stores, with looters running in to collect bundles of clothes and other merchandise, then running out. Boxes littered the sidewalk as thieves were seen transferring goods into plastic trash bags. A 5:30 p.m. PST curfew was announced due to the protests. The looting came despite the arrival of the National Guard troops in neighboring Los Angeles, which had seen extensive looting, vandalism and arson on Saturday. Murfreesboro, Tennessee: Brick thrown into business, police use tear gas A small but tense demonstration in Murfreesboro, Tennessee, appeared to have dispersed after demonstrators blocked traffic and threw a brick through the window of a local business, prompting police to respond with canisters of tear gas. About 50 protesters, many of whom appeared to be Middle Tennessee State University students, marched from Main Street toward Forrest Hall, a campus building named for Confederate general and Ku Klux Klan founder Nathan Bedford Forrest. Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee said protests in Murfreesboro are now “overt threats to public safety and property.” Police said an armored vehicle was vandalized and protesters have blocked traffic by lying in the street in an intersection. Officers responded by throwing canisters of tear gas to drive protesters out of the street. However, before the protest escalated, negotiations between police and protest leaders led to calm, then students and officers were seen walking together and posing for photos. – Nancy DeGennaro, Joseph Spears, Mealand Ragland-Hudgins and Brinley Hineman, Murfreesboro Daily News Journal Savannah, Georgia: Protesters chant 'Arrest the other three' during rally Thousands demonstrated against racism and the killings of black people at the hands of police Sunday in Savannah, Georgia. City leaders joined protesters who peacefully marched from Johnson Square to City Hall. “We need to make sure that we stop apologizing and we move from apology to action,” Savannah Police Chief Roy Minter said. At one point during Mayor Van Johnson’s speech, the crowd broke into a chant of “arrest the other three,” referring to other Minneapolis police officers who stood by while an officer knelt on Floyd’s neck. “Yeah, they should arrest the other three,” Johnson said. “We are tired of the mess and we want it to stop now. We stand here as a united community to say that we are standing with George Floyd and his family, because no man should ever have to die like that,” Johnson said. “We stand here united as a community to say that crooked police officers are called criminals. And in jail, they should be.” – Will Peebles, Dennis Knight, Mary Landers, Nathan Dominitz and Zach Dennis, Savannah Morning News San Diego: Police fire tear gas after being assaulted by rocks and bottles San Diego Police said they fired tear gas canisters Sunday after rocks and bottles were thrown at them. The department said in a series of tweets that the confrontation was taking place at Second Avenue and Broadway in the seaside city's downtown. ""Certain protestors continue to throw objects and vandalize our city,"" the department said in one post. ""The criminal behavior of these few is unacceptable. We are continuing to order the crowd to disperse."" Earlier, however, the department praised the peacefulness of most demonstrators. But it said it had to issue the order to disperse because of the dangerous actions of a few. At one point, demonstrators occupied Interstate 5, stopping traffic in both directions, the San Diego Union-Tribune reported. Philadelphia: Mayor Jim Kenney 'saddened and disappointed' beyond words Another day of street protests gave way to looting, with at least one police vehicle set on fire. Looters were running out of stores in the northeastern section of the city with armloads of merchandise. In the downtown, workers and volunteers swept up broken glass from windows shattered during riots the previous day. Graffiti was being removed. Mayor Jim Kenney said the mayhem “saddened and disappointed me beyond words, and I’m sure it saddened every Philadelphian who takes pride in their city.” He said those responsible “not only desecrated private businesses, they also desecrated the important message that was heard in the earlier peaceful protests.” Spartanburg, South Carolina: Passing motorists show support for protesters Chanting “No justice, no peace,” about 100 peaceful Spartanburg, South Carolina, protesters gathered at Barnet Park, drawing support from motorists who honked their car horns. “We want to take a peaceful stand to show support,” said organizer Kelvin Brown. “If we can all come together as a people, black and white, we can make a difference.” Many protesters said it wasn’t just Floyd’s death at the hand of a white police officer, or that it took days before the officer was arrested, that triggered anger. “We need to end the racist system,” said Curtis Pickens. “If you want all this to stop, real justice is what is needed. Stop the racial and social profiling. Stop hiring white supremacist officers.” “It’s time to stand up for what we believe in,” Isaiah Jordan said. “What happened to George Floyd terrorizes the whole nation. We’ve got to do something about it. I’m just sick and tired of young, black men dying."" --Bob Montgomery, GoUpstate.com Lafayette, Louisiana: Protesters want police to know 'we're human' Hundreds of protesters, some wearing protective face coverings, lined Lafayette streets to join a peaceful demonstration against police brutality. The protest, peaceful like others in Baton Rouge and New Orleans this weekend, began in the morning with protesters lining the streets to chant. “I am sick and tired of being sick and tired,” Lafayette NAACP President Marja Broussard said to protesters. “I have a message for law enforcement. The message is: we want you to know that we’re human just like you...We want you to know we have families. We’re human.” – William Taylor Potter, Lafayette Daily Advertiser Augusta, Georgia: Demonstrators chant 'No justice, no peace' Demonstrators chanted “no justice, no peace” as they walked along Washington Road in Augusta, Georgia. While “No justice, no peace,” was a popular chant among protesters, Sunday’s peaceful march was about showing strength through peace rather than through violence, organizers said. Latoya Lovett said she asked the Street Justice Council to help her organize the marches after hearing many Augusta residents talk about going to Atlanta to join protests there, which have turned violent after peaceful starts. “You can march in your own city, you can have a voice in your own city,” Lovett said. “You don’t have to go smash windows, you don’t have to go beat people, you don’t have to drop on the police.” Demonstrators were escorted by Richmond County Sheriff’s Office deputies who blocked off roads and intersections as needed. Sheriff Richard Roundtree was among those who helped guide the marchers and ensure safety for both them and the motorists. “We believe in free speech and protesting and voicing your opinion, as long as you do it in a safe manner,” Roundtree said. “As long as you’re doing that, we’re all for it.” – Will Cheney and Miguel Legoas, The Augusta Chronicle Jacksonville, Florida: Peaceful rally follows violent Saturday night of protests A peaceful demonstration was held Sunday outside the Duval County Courthouse. Then protesters started moving downtown and Jacksonville, Florida, police worked to keep them in certain areas. The cleanup of smashed store windows began Sunday around Florida after a night of unrest throughout the state’s cities. Jacksonville Sheriff Mike Williams said an unnamed deputy was either stabbed or slashed in the neck and was taken to a hospital for treatment Saturday night. A sheriff’s office spokeswoman would not comment on the deputy’s condition Sunday morning. A protest Saturday resulted in many arrests, “but we still don’t know how many or anything related to those arrests,” the sheriff said. – Sarasota News-Tribune Cincinnati: Police make 100 arrests after urging protesters to go home Police arrested as many as 100 people after using tear gas and imploring the crowd to go home ahead of a curfew. It ended a day that earlier featured a large crowd gathered at Inwood Park in Cincinnati to hear speakers as a rally, followed by a march. Organizers gave instructions about what to do if they are tear-gassed. The rally started with a fist-up salute and a song about the death Sam DuBose, shot by a police officer not far from the scene of this protest in 2015. Some Cincinnati City Council members tweeted from the rally. – Sarah Brookbank, Cincinnati Enquirer Contributing: The Associated Press",0.0

Crews cleared broken glass along the Downtown Crossing, a mostly pedestrian shopping and commercial district, as well as the Common, the city's central park, and the Back Bay, a nearby neighborhood of high-end shops and stately brick townhouses. Looters on Sunday plundered stores including a Walgreens and a shoe retailer, and vandals smashed store windows and scrawled graffiti across parts of a church, a law school and other structures. A downtown street bore the char marks from a police car that had been set ablaze as protesters and looters clashed with police. Cardboard protest signs and other trash littered the Common. In Back Bay, a wine shop had been looted, and an H&M clothing store's glass doors had been shattered, but an Apple store was untouched, shielded by plywood boards. Boston police say 40 people were arrested and seven officers injured after being pelted with bricks, rocks, and glass bottles. Twenty-one police cruisers were damaged. Democratic Mayor Marty Walsh, who is set to speak at noon Monday, said in a statement that he supported the peaceful protests, but that was was angered by those who ""chose to engage in acts of destruction and violence, undermining their message."" Republican Gov. Charlie Baker, who will speak later Monday, also criticized the violence, calling it ""criminal and cowardly"" and saying it ""distracted from the powerful statement made today by thousands of Massachusetts residents."" Thousands of mostly mask-wearing demonstrators marched peacefully through Boston in several protests Sunday in response to the killing of George Floyd, who died June 25 after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee on his neck as he was handcuffed and pleaded for air. The largest gathering began in the historically black Boston neighborhood of Roxbury, with several thousand people making their way about 4 miles to the State House downtown near the Common. But as the march ended around 9 p.m., protesters and police clashed. The National Guard was called about a few hours later to help quell the unrest. __ Associated Press writer Michael Casey in Boston contributed to this report. j",0.0
1622474449,2020-06-01 12:10:10,George Floyd. Ahmaud Arbery. Breonna Taylor. What do we tell our children?,https://www.newportri.com/zz/news/20200601/george-floyd-ahmaud-arbery-breonna-taylor-what-do-we-tell-our-children?rssfeed=true,en,False,,653261,Mercury - United States - Rhode Island,http://www.newportmercury.com/,"Should we tell the children? How? Those are among the many questions parents are asking after the recent deaths of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor. Many white parents wonder whether to talk with their kids at all, while parents of color swallow their grief and fear to have ""the talk"" once again. These deaths are part of a more complex story, one some parents have been telling for generations, and others have long felt they've had the luxury to ignore. But experts in child psychology and race-based stress say these conversations are essential for all parents to have, and they underscore that there are developmentally appropriate ways to talk to children of all ages about racism and police brutality. ""Silence will not protect you or them,"" said Beverly Daniel Tatum, a psychologist and author of, Why Are All The Black Kids Sitting Together in the Cafeteria? And Other Conversations About Race. ""Avoiding the topic is not a solution."" Racism persists, experts say, because many parents avoid difficult conversations. ""One of the most important things to remember is that you may not have all the answers and that is OK,"" said Erlanger Turner, a clinical psychologist and assistant professor of psychology at Pepperdine University who studies mental health among racial communities. USA TODAY spoke with Tatum and Turner about how to talk with children about racial violence: Why is it important to talk with children about what happened to George Floyd and other incidents of police brutality or racism in the news? Beverly Daniel Tatum: Even young children may see or hear about highly publicized incidents like the George Floyd case – perhaps overhearing the TV or the radio – and may ask questions. Or if parents are upset by the news, the child may perceive the parent’s distress and ask why mom or dad is upset. In either case, an age-appropriate explanation is better than silence. Older children with Internet access may see online images on their own. Initiating an age-appropriate conversation can give children a helpful frame for understanding difficult realities. If parents are silent, children will draw their own often faulty conclusions about what is happening and why. Erlanger Turner: Many adults are hurt and angered by these events and their children may notice changes in their mood. It is helpful to have a healthy conversation around what happened and also talk about ways to cope when you witness social injustice. Does COVID-19 warrant avoiding these conversations, given many children are already struggling with fear, anxiety and uncertainty? BDT: No. Not talking about upsetting events only fuels fear, anxiety and uncertainty. Being able to talk about something with a supportive adult can reduce fear, anxiety and uncertainty. Parents may avoid the conversation because they don’t know what to say, but it is a mistake to think that their silence is helpful. ET: I don't think that anxiety and fear about COVID-19 should stop a parent from talking about police brutality. This issue has been increasing in concern over the last few years as the number of black and brown people killed by police continue to rise. I think if you do talk with your child don't leave them in a high state of worry. Make sure to end the conversation by engaging in a pleasant activity after the difficult discussion so they won't stay worried or afraid. How do parents start these conversations and how does that change depending on the age of their children? ET: I think the first place to start a conversation around racism and police brutality is with honesty. Take ownership of your feelings and be comfortable sharing those feelings with your child. Then you can begin to allow them to share what they may already know about racial differences. I think that it is always good to allow children to share their opinion and understanding before you offer information. For younger children conversations about racism should be limited to basic facts about how people are treated differently due to the color of their skin but also acknowledge that not everyone treats people differently based on race. For older teens, parents can consider exposure to news or social media posts as discussion points about this issue. BDT: Regardless of the age of the child, it is important to balance acknowledging the reality of racism, or unfairness, with messages about the possibility of change, and the community of allies who are working together to make things better. If a child of color asks if a police officer is going to kill them, what do you say? BDT: The answer will depend on the age of the child. If it is a young child, a parent can be reassuring. “No, honey, you don’t have to worry about that. Police officers don’t want to hurt you.” In response to an older child, it can be reassuring to say something like: ""I know that it is scary to think that something like that might happen, and I really don’t want you to worry about anything like that. I know that most police officers want to help people, and most police officers never fire their guns. But sometimes they do get nervous and make mistakes. So it is important for you to know what to do if a police officer ever stops you…” Black parents often refer to this as “the talk” they have to have with their adolescent sons to increase the odds they will survive an encounter with a police officer if and when they are stopped. ET: That is a tough question. Depending on the age of the child, they may have some awareness of youth that have been killed by police. Obviously you don't want to respond in a way that is going to make children be more fearful for their safety. In my opinion, I think that you should let children know that most police officers work to protect them and their community. If a child says they are afraid or angry, what do you say? BDT: Acknowledge the child’s feelings. The parent may have similar feelings. “I know it’s upsetting to hear about and see these things happening. It upsets me too when bad things like this happen. Racism is very unfair. But it makes me feel better to know there are lots of people who want to change things."" Being able to offer specific examples of community change agents would be useful. Being able to talk about what family members are doing to speak up against unfairness is especially useful. Actions always speak louder than words. ET: If a child tells you that they are angry, that is appropriate. Don't force them to hide their emotional expression. However, be sure to help them identify ways to express their anger in a healthy manner which may include journaling or exercising to release the energy from their body. If a child is afraid for one of their friends, what do you say? BDT: “I can see that you are worried about your friend. What do you think we could do that might help him or her?” Depending on the situation, this could be an opportunity to talk about what it means to be an ally, and how to stand in solidarity with another person. ET: If a child is afraid for one of their friends, talk with them about those emotions. Allow the child to express why they may be afraid and help them identify how they can check on their friend's safety to ease their anxiety or fear. Part of what increases anxiety is the fear of the unknown. If you have a plan of action it will reduce some of those fears. How can parents talk about law enforcement in a way that is honest but also doesn’t discourage children from seeking help from law enforcement when appropriate? BDT: Most police officers become police officers because they want to help people. And there are times when we would really want a police officer to help us – give some examples – if there’s been a car accident, or if someone took something that belonged to us, etc. But sometimes a police officer does something bad, like today. When that happens, we might start to think that all police officers are like that. But it’s important to remember that that is not true. ET: I think that it is very important to talk with the children about law enforcement. For example, you can talk with them about how they protect rules in society such as making sure that people don't drive too fast so they won't harm themselves or others. Providing clear examples about the ways that law enforcement helps society will allow the child to better understand. You can also be honest about situations such as police brutality and let children know that some police officers break laws. If you have a trusted officer in your community it may be good to also allow the child to talk with them in person to reduce their fear. Should these conversations be different depending on the race of the child? BDT: Children of color are likely to experience racist encounters as they get older. They need to be helped to understand their own worth and feel affirmed in their identity as young people of color despite the negative messages they may get from others. Parents of color want to raise self-confident and empowered children who are not demoralized by other people’s racism. This requires lots of conversation about racism and how to resist it in an ongoing way throughout their children’s lives. White children are often racially isolated as a consequence of segregated schools and neighborhoods, and consequently limited in their understanding of people different from themselves. White parents who want to interrupt the cycle of racism must learn to talk to their children about it and model their own anti-racist activity. ET: According to research, white parents often don't talk with their children about race or may emphasize ""not seeing color."" The concept of colorblindness or ""not seeing color"" is more harmful than helpful and does not honor an individual's identity. ... For white families, research suggests ... conversations should focus on raising anti-racist children and encouraging more friendships with children from others races. Many of these deaths garner attention because footage of it goes viral. What should we say if our child asks to see it? BDT: There are many adults who don’t want to see such footage. I would not show it to a child at all. Once an image is in your head, it is very difficult to get it out. That said, it is reasonable to describe what happened and talk about why it was wrong. It is also likely that children with Internet access can view the footage without an adult’s permission or assistance. Talking about it after the fact will help children process their feelings. ET: You should not show your children these videos as it may increase the likelihood of them experiencing symptoms of trauma or having nightmares. What we know from research on witnessing disasters is that individuals may be at a higher risk of developing post-traumatic stress disorder even through indirect exposure to these events. What do we say if, in the course of this conversation, a child says something racist? BDT: Inquire about it with curiosity, not judgment. ""I’m wondering why you said that…"" After hearing more about what the child is thinking, you can offer correction by providing new information. “You know, a lot of people might think that is true, but I don’t because….” ET: I think the first thing to do is to not get defensive. You want to foster open communication with your child. However, I think you should explore why they have that opinion, where did they learn it from, and tell them why what they said was wrong. It might be helpful for you as a parent to think about ways that you may have unconsciously expressed racist attitudes. How can parents explain the uprisings in a way that doesn’t condone violence but also doesn't minimize the sense of injustice fueling them? BDT: Children understand the concept of unfairness as well as the experience of frustration. Years and years of unfairness – racism – results in intense anger and frustration. The conversation can then be about what we must do to fix the continuing unfairness. ET: I think it is important for parents to be honest. Share your hurt, anger, or disappointment with your child. You should also talk about different ways to protest social injustice such as calling your local politicians office or even visit their office to talk with them about policy change to reduce injustice.

Jack Manderscheid, a University of Minnesota senior, exemplified the spirit of the day by meticulously walking through the Uptown neighborhood filling up four trash bags that he carried on his bicycle. “I’ve never really seen a community come together,” said Manderscheid, a native of suburban Edina who woke up Sunday intent on finding one gesture to help put the city. There have been five nights of anguished protests following the Monday death of George Floyd, a black man whose neck was knelt on for nearly nine minutes by Derek Chauvin, a white police officer. Manderscheid had attended a demonstration earlier in the week, but the fumes from tear gas used by police officers bothered him. So had the large crowds during a time when he is trying to keep his distance from people over fears of spreading the new coronavirus. He instead decided to clean the streets and sidewalks, only to find that hundreds of others had the same idea. “The longer this goes on, the more I realize I’m going to remember this the rest of my life,” Manderscheid said. Meanwhile, Dan Halvorsen picked up trash and swept away debris along with seven other members of his church in suburban Bloomington. “We wanted to perform a good deed. Our hearts are just breaking about this whole situation,” he said. “By the time we got here, the response has been so amazing, that there wasn’t a big need for us.” Other residents found a way to help by providing food, diapers and other essentials in a city where most stores and restaurants are closed. That’s how Tracy Gray Knutson found herself an unwitting, but perfectly willing, Santa Claus of sorts. Knutson, 40, sat down on a chair on the sidewalk outside a boarded-up Franklin Avenue café, planning to rest her sunburned feet. Above her, a large sign read: “Free Food and Stuff.” Residents of the south Minneapolis neighborhood surveyed the scene and decided that Knutson was in charge of a popup pantry. Soon, they descended on her with sacks of bread, beans and other groceries, plus diapers, bottled water and even more garbage bags ready to be filled. Knutson, who said she is recently homeless, enjoyed giving the goods away to a line of people who politely approached her, asking if it was really free. “Anything you want, brother. Take anything,” she implored one hesitant man. “I love you.” A few blocks away on Franklin Avenue, an east-west thoroughfare lined with stores that now sit empty, Alan Gross oversaw an impromptu food shelf that quickly resembled a warehouse. Gross, 52, jokingly called himself a barista/counselor/bouncer at two businesses that share a building: Powwow Grounds Coffee and All My Relations Gallery. The latter is a large space that typically displays American Indian art. It was shuttered in March after the COVID-19 threat forced the closure of museums and galleries in Minnesota. The art has been relocated, although Gross hopes to reopen soon. On Sunday, the floor was rapidly filling with food brought in by the carload from people eager to help. It all happened over the course of 72 hours, after word went out on Facebook that the gallery would serve as a distribution point for groceries in the neighborhood. Gross was surprised by the amount of donated food but philosophical about the motivation of his fellow Minnesotans. “Pitching in, believing that there’s a better way to do things, I think that’s the draw,” he said. “Everyone’s got to have a cause.”",0.0
1622478502,2020-06-01 13:02:30,"Raimondo: George Floyd death, protests should be a wake-up call",https://www.wpri.com/news/local-news/providence/raimondo-george-floyd-death-protests-should-be-a-wake-up-call/,en,False,,23384,wpri.com,http://www.wpri.com,"PROVIDENCE, R.I. (WPRI) — Rhode Island Gov. Gina Raimondo says the death of George Floyd and the protests in response have to be a wake-up call for all Americans. The death of Floyd, a black man killed by police in Minnesota last Monday, was captured on video by bystanders pleading with police to let him free. The video shows former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin pinning Floyd down with his knee at Floyd’s neck until Floyd was unconscious. He later died. Chauvin has since been arrested and charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Three other officers in the video have not been charged. Protests around the country came in the days following Floyd’s death, with some resulting in violence, vandalism and looting. A day of peaceful protesting in Boston turned into riots and police officers were injured, police cruisers were damaged, and at least 40 people were arrested on the street. In Rhode Island, a protest was held in Providence Saturday afternoon. A group first rallied at Burnside Park before marching to the State House. Police reported a largely peaceful rally, with no arrests made. Much later that night, however, acts of vandalism were reported. Rhode Island State Police responded to find explicit messages spray-painted on the State House steps and entrance, and two glass doors shattered. At the time, police say about 50 protesters were assembled. On a phone call with reporters Monday morning, Raimondo said she spoke with African American faith leaders over the weekend. She said the theme of those conversations focused on pain and anger.

(Story continues below the video.) “As a white woman of privilege, I don’t know what it’s like to be fearful of going for a jog and being discriminated against or attacked,” Raimondo said. “People like me need to do a lot more listening with humility before we can commit to specific actions.” On the vandalism at the State House, Raimondo said any form of vandalism is unacceptable, adding those who participated will be prosecuted. However, she said what’s driving the vandalism needs to be acknowledged, as well. “We all need to ask ourselves in whatever walk of life we find ourselves, what more can we do to bring about a more equal and more just America, and what more can we do to fight back against racism on an individual level and institutional level?” Raimondo said. The governor said she is in constant contact with the state police, adding that the current approach in regards to protesting is to deescalate while encouraging the voluntary compliance with social distancing and public health guidelines in place due to COVID-19. She also noted she was proud of the protesters in Rhode Island this weekend for remaining peaceful and compliant. Raimondo also acknowledged members of the press, noting those reporting on the front line of the protests have been put in danger or arrested by police for doing their job. “You have my respect and support, and I hope that you’ll have the courage to continue doing what you’re doing,” Raimondo said directly to reporters on the call.

(WPRI) — Rhode Island Gov. Gina Raimondo says the death of George Floyd and the protests in response have to be a wake-up call for all Americans. The death of Floyd, a black man killed by police in Minnesota last Monday, was captured on video by bystanders pleading with police to let him free. The video shows former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin pinning Floyd down with his knee at Floyd’s neck until Floyd was unconscious. He later died. Chauvin has since been arrested and charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Three other officers in the video have not been charged. Protests around the country came in the days following Floyd’s death, with some resulting in violence, vandalism and looting. A day of peaceful protesting in Boston turned into riots and police officers were injured, police cruisers were damaged, and at least 40 people were arrested on the street. In Rhode Island, a protest was held in Providence Saturday afternoon. A group first rallied at Burnside Park before marching to the State House. Police reported a largely peaceful rally, with no arrests made. Much later that night, however, acts of vandalism were reported. Rhode Island State Police responded to find explicit messages spray-painted on the State House steps and entrance, and two glass doors shattered. At the time, police say about 50 protesters were assembled. On a phone call with reporters Monday morning, Raimondo said she spoke with African American faith leaders over the weekend. She said the theme of those conversations focused on pain and anger. The governor did not have any new policies to announce Monday, but said she will first commit to engaging and listening to concerns of young people and people of color. (Story continues below the video.) “As a white woman of privilege, I don’t know what it’s like to be fearful of going for a jog and being discriminated against or attacked,” Raimondo said. “People like me need to do a lot more listening with humility before we can commit to specific actions.” On the vandalism at the State House, Raimondo said any form of vandalism is unacceptable, adding those who participated will be prosecuted.

What do we tell our children?,https://www.newportri.com/zz/news/20200601/george-floyd-ahmaud-arbery-breonna-taylor-what-do-we-tell-our-children?rssfeed=true,en,False,,662951,Newport Life,http://www.newportlifemagazine.com/,"Should we tell the children? How? Those are among the many questions parents are asking after the recent deaths of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor. Many white parents wonder whether to talk with their kids at all, while parents of color swallow their grief and fear to have ""the talk"" once again. These deaths are part of a more complex story, one some parents have been telling for generations, and others have long felt they've had the luxury to ignore. But experts in child psychology and race-based stress say these conversations are essential for all parents to have, and they underscore that there are developmentally appropriate ways to talk to children of all ages about racism and police brutality. ""Silence will not protect you or them,"" said Beverly Daniel Tatum, a psychologist and author of, Why Are All The Black Kids Sitting Together in the Cafeteria? And Other Conversations About Race. ""Avoiding the topic is not a solution."" Racism persists, experts say, because many parents avoid difficult conversations. ""One of the most important things to remember is that you may not have all the answers and that is OK,"" said Erlanger Turner, a clinical psychologist and assistant professor of psychology at Pepperdine University who studies mental health among racial communities. USA TODAY spoke with Tatum and Turner about how to talk with children about racial violence: Why is it important to talk with children about what happened to George Floyd and other incidents of police brutality or racism in the news? Beverly Daniel Tatum: Even young children may see or hear about highly publicized incidents like the George Floyd case – perhaps overhearing the TV or the radio – and may ask questions. Or if parents are upset by the news, the child may perceive the parent’s distress and ask why mom or dad is upset. In either case, an age-appropriate explanation is better than silence. Older children with Internet access may see online images on their own. Initiating an age-appropriate conversation can give children a helpful frame for understanding difficult realities. If parents are silent, children will draw their own often faulty conclusions about what is happening and why. Erlanger Turner: Many adults are hurt and angered by these events and their children may notice changes in their mood. It is helpful to have a healthy conversation around what happened and also talk about ways to cope when you witness social injustice. Does COVID-19 warrant avoiding these conversations, given many children are already struggling with fear, anxiety and uncertainty? BDT: No. Not talking about upsetting events only fuels fear, anxiety and uncertainty. Being able to talk about something with a supportive adult can reduce fear, anxiety and uncertainty. Parents may avoid the conversation because they don’t know what to say, but it is a mistake to think that their silence is helpful. ET: I don't think that anxiety and fear about COVID-19 should stop a parent from talking about police brutality. This issue has been increasing in concern over the last few years as the number of black and brown people killed by police continue to rise. I think if you do talk with your child don't leave them in a high state of worry. Make sure to end the conversation by engaging in a pleasant activity after the difficult discussion so they won't stay worried or afraid. How do parents start these conversations and how does that change depending on the age of their children? ET: I think the first place to start a conversation around racism and police brutality is with honesty. Take ownership of your feelings and be comfortable sharing those feelings with your child. Then you can begin to allow them to share what they may already know about racial differences. I think that it is always good to allow children to share their opinion and understanding before you offer information. For younger children conversations about racism should be limited to basic facts about how people are treated differently due to the color of their skin but also acknowledge that not everyone treats people differently based on race. For older teens, parents can consider exposure to news or social media posts as discussion points about this issue. BDT: Regardless of the age of the child, it is important to balance acknowledging the reality of racism, or unfairness, with messages about the possibility of change, and the community of allies who are working together to make things better. If a child of color asks if a police officer is going to kill them, what do you say? BDT: The answer will depend on the age of the child. If it is a young child, a parent can be reassuring. “No, honey, you don’t have to worry about that. Police officers don’t want to hurt you.” In response to an older child, it can be reassuring to say something like: ""I know that it is scary to think that something like that might happen, and I really don’t want you to worry about anything like that. I know that most police officers want to help people, and most police officers never fire their guns. But sometimes they do get nervous and make mistakes. So it is important for you to know what to do if a police officer ever stops you…” Black parents often refer to this as “the talk” they have to have with their adolescent sons to increase the odds they will survive an encounter with a police officer if and when they are stopped. ET: That is a tough question. Depending on the age of the child, they may have some awareness of youth that have been killed by police. Obviously you don't want to respond in a way that is going to make children be more fearful for their safety. In my opinion, I think that you should let children know that most police officers work to protect them and their community. If a child says they are afraid or angry, what do you say? BDT: Acknowledge the child’s feelings. The parent may have similar feelings. “I know it’s upsetting to hear about and see these things happening. It upsets me too when bad things like this happen. Racism is very unfair. But it makes me feel better to know there are lots of people who want to change things."" Being able to offer specific examples of community change agents would be useful. Being able to talk about what family members are doing to speak up against unfairness is especially useful. Actions always speak louder than words. ET: If a child tells you that they are angry, that is appropriate. Don't force them to hide their emotional expression. However, be sure to help them identify ways to express their anger in a healthy manner which may include journaling or exercising to release the energy from their body. If a child is afraid for one of their friends, what do you say? BDT: “I can see that you are worried about your friend. What do you think we could do that might help him or her?” Depending on the situation, this could be an opportunity to talk about what it means to be an ally, and how to stand in solidarity with another person. ET: If a child is afraid for one of their friends, talk with them about those emotions. Allow the child to express why they may be afraid and help them identify how they can check on their friend's safety to ease their anxiety or fear. Part of what increases anxiety is the fear of the unknown. If you have a plan of action it will reduce some of those fears. How can parents talk about law enforcement in a way that is honest but also doesn’t discourage children from seeking help from law enforcement when appropriate? BDT: Most police officers become police officers because they want to help people. And there are times when we would really want a police officer to help us – give some examples – if there’s been a car accident, or if someone took something that belonged to us, etc. But sometimes a police officer does something bad, like today. When that happens, we might start to think that all police officers are like that. But it’s important to remember that that is not true. ET: I think that it is very important to talk with the children about law enforcement. For example, you can talk with them about how they protect rules in society such as making sure that people don't drive too fast so they won't harm themselves or others. Providing clear examples about the ways that law enforcement helps society will allow the child to better understand. You can also be honest about situations such as police brutality and let children know that some police officers break laws. If you have a trusted officer in your community it may be good to also allow the child to talk with them in person to reduce their fear. Should these conversations be different depending on the race of the child? BDT: Children of color are likely to experience racist encounters as they get older. They need to be helped to understand their own worth and feel affirmed in their identity as young people of color despite the negative messages they may get from others. Parents of color want to raise self-confident and empowered children who are not demoralized by other people’s racism. This requires lots of conversation about racism and how to resist it in an ongoing way throughout their children’s lives. White children are often racially isolated as a consequence of segregated schools and neighborhoods, and consequently limited in their understanding of people different from themselves. White parents who want to interrupt the cycle of racism must learn to talk to their children about it and model their own anti-racist activity. ET: According to research, white parents often don't talk with their children about race or may emphasize ""not seeing color."" The concept of colorblindness or ""not seeing color"" is more harmful than helpful and does not honor an individual's identity. ... For white families, research suggests ... conversations should focus on raising anti-racist children and encouraging more friendships with children from others races. Many of these deaths garner attention because footage of it goes viral. What should we say if our child asks to see it? BDT: There are many adults who don’t want to see such footage. I would not show it to a child at all. Once an image is in your head, it is very difficult to get it out. That said, it is reasonable to describe what happened and talk about why it was wrong. It is also likely that children with Internet access can view the footage without an adult’s permission or assistance. Talking about it after the fact will help children process their feelings. ET: You should not show your children these videos as it may increase the likelihood of them experiencing symptoms of trauma or having nightmares. What we know from research on witnessing disasters is that individuals may be at a higher risk of developing post-traumatic stress disorder even through indirect exposure to these events. What do we say if, in the course of this conversation, a child says something racist? BDT: Inquire about it with curiosity, not judgment. ""I’m wondering why you said that…"" After hearing more about what the child is thinking, you can offer correction by providing new information. “You know, a lot of people might think that is true, but I don’t because….” ET: I think the first thing to do is to not get defensive. You want to foster open communication with your child. However, I think you should explore why they have that opinion, where did they learn it from, and tell them why what they said was wrong. It might be helpful for you as a parent to think about ways that you may have unconsciously expressed racist attitudes. How can parents explain the uprisings in a way that doesn’t condone violence but also doesn't minimize the sense of injustice fueling them? BDT: Children understand the concept of unfairness as well as the experience of frustration. Years and years of unfairness – racism – results in intense anger and frustration. The conversation can then be about what we must do to fix the continuing unfairness. ET: I think it is important for parents to be honest. Share your hurt, anger, or disappointment with your child. You should also talk about different ways to protest social injustice such as calling your local politicians office or even visit their office to talk with them about policy change to reduce injustice.

1622519195,2020-06-01 12:32:51,Minneapolis is trying to recover after days of George Floyd protests – one bag of garbage and one food donation at a time,https://www.newportri.com/zz/news/20200601/minneapolis-is-trying-to-recover-after-days-of-george-floyd-protests---one-bag-of-garbage-and-one-food-donation-at-time?rssfeed=true,en,False,,662951,Newport Life,http://www.newportlifemagazine.com/,"MINNEAPOLIS — At the end of a week that roiled this city of 400,000, there were people carrying brooms and garbage bags on a sunny Sunday. Jack Manderscheid, a University of Minnesota senior, exemplified the spirit of the day by meticulously walking through the Uptown neighborhood filling up four trash bags that he carried on his bicycle. “I’ve never really seen a community come together,” said Manderscheid, a native of suburban Edina who woke up Sunday intent on finding one gesture to help put the city. There have been five nights of anguished protests following the Monday death of George Floyd, a black man whose neck was knelt on for nearly nine minutes by Derek Chauvin, a white police officer. Manderscheid had attended a demonstration earlier in the week, but the fumes from tear gas used by police officers bothered him. So had the large crowds during a time when he is trying to keep his distance from people over fears of spreading the new coronavirus. He instead decided to clean the streets and sidewalks, only to find that hundreds of others had the same idea. “The longer this goes on, the more I realize I’m going to remember this the rest of my life,” Manderscheid said. Meanwhile, Dan Halvorsen picked up trash and swept away debris along with seven other members of his church in suburban Bloomington. “We wanted to perform a good deed. Our hearts are just breaking about this whole situation,” he said. “By the time we got here, the response has been so amazing, that there wasn’t a big need for us.” Other residents found a way to help by providing food, diapers and other essentials in a city where most stores and restaurants are closed. That’s how Tracy Gray Knutson found herself an unwitting, but perfectly willing, Santa Claus of sorts. Knutson, 40, sat down on a chair on the sidewalk outside a boarded-up Franklin Avenue café, planning to rest her sunburned feet. Above her, a large sign read: “Free Food and Stuff.” Residents of the south Minneapolis neighborhood surveyed the scene and decided that Knutson was in charge of a popup pantry. Soon, they descended on her with sacks of bread, beans and other groceries, plus diapers, bottled water and even more garbage bags ready to be filled. Knutson, who said she is recently homeless, enjoyed giving the goods away to a line of people who politely approached her, asking if it was really free. “Anything you want, brother. Take anything,” she implored one hesitant man. “I love you.” A few blocks away on Franklin Avenue, an east-west thoroughfare lined with stores that now sit empty, Alan Gross oversaw an impromptu food shelf that quickly resembled a warehouse. Gross, 52, jokingly called himself a barista/counselor/bouncer at two businesses that share a building: Powwow Grounds Coffee and All My Relations Gallery. The latter is a large space that typically displays American Indian art. It was shuttered in March after the COVID-19 threat forced the closure of museums and galleries in Minnesota. The art has been relocated, although Gross hopes to reopen soon. On Sunday, the floor was rapidly filling with food brought in by the carload from people eager to help. It all happened over the course of 72 hours, after word went out on Facebook that the gallery would serve as a distribution point for groceries in the neighborhood. Gross was surprised by the amount of donated food but philosophical about the motivation of his fellow Minnesotans. “Pitching in, believing that there’s a better way to do things, I think that’s the draw,” he said. “Everyone’s got to have a cause.”",0.0

1622519919,2020-06-01 12:32:51,Minneapolis is trying to recover after days of George Floyd protests – one bag of garbage and one food donation at a time,https://www.newportri.com/zz/news/20200601/minneapolis-is-trying-to-recover-after-days-of-george-floyd-protests---one-bag-of-garbage-and-one-food-donation-at-time?rssfeed=true,en,False,,662950,Newport Daily News,http://www.newportdailynews.com/ee/newportdailynews/index.php,"MINNEAPOLIS — At the end of a week that roiled this city of 400,000, there were people carrying brooms and garbage bags on a sunny Sunday. Jack Manderscheid, a University of Minnesota senior, exemplified the spirit of the day by meticulously walking through the Uptown neighborhood filling up four trash bags that he carried on his bicycle. “I’ve never really seen a community come together,” said Manderscheid, a native of suburban Edina who woke up Sunday intent on finding one gesture to help put the city. There have been five nights of anguished protests following the Monday death of George Floyd, a black man whose neck was knelt on for nearly nine minutes by Derek Chauvin, a white police officer. Manderscheid had attended a demonstration earlier in the week, but the fumes from tear gas used by police officers bothered him. So had the large crowds during a time when he is trying to keep his distance from people over fears of spreading the new coronavirus. He instead decided to clean the streets and sidewalks, only to find that hundreds of others had the same idea. “The longer this goes on, the more I realize I’m going to remember this the rest of my life,” Manderscheid said. Meanwhile, Dan Halvorsen picked up trash and swept away debris along with seven other members of his church in suburban Bloomington. “We wanted to perform a good deed. Our hearts are just breaking about this whole situation,” he said. “By the time we got here, the response has been so amazing, that there wasn’t a big need for us.” Other residents found a way to help by providing food, diapers and other essentials in a city where most stores and restaurants are closed. That’s how Tracy Gray Knutson found herself an unwitting, but perfectly willing, Santa Claus of sorts. Knutson, 40, sat down on a chair on the sidewalk outside a boarded-up Franklin Avenue café, planning to rest her sunburned feet. Above her, a large sign read: “Free Food and Stuff.” Residents of the south Minneapolis neighborhood surveyed the scene and decided that Knutson was in charge of a popup pantry. Soon, they descended on her with sacks of bread, beans and other groceries, plus diapers, bottled water and even more garbage bags ready to be filled. Knutson, who said she is recently homeless, enjoyed giving the goods away to a line of people who politely approached her, asking if it was really free. “Anything you want, brother. Take anything,” she implored one hesitant man. “I love you.” A few blocks away on Franklin Avenue, an east-west thoroughfare lined with stores that now sit empty, Alan Gross oversaw an impromptu food shelf that quickly resembled a warehouse. Gross, 52, jokingly called himself a barista/counselor/bouncer at two businesses that share a building: Powwow Grounds Coffee and All My Relations Gallery. The latter is a large space that typically displays American Indian art. It was shuttered in March after the COVID-19 threat forced the closure of museums and galleries in Minnesota. The art has been relocated, although Gross hopes to reopen soon. On Sunday, the floor was rapidly filling with food brought in by the carload from people eager to help. It all happened over the course of 72 hours, after word went out on Facebook that the gallery would serve as a distribution point for groceries in the neighborhood. Gross was surprised by the amount of donated food but philosophical about the motivation of his fellow Minnesotans. “Pitching in, believing that there’s a better way to do things, I think that’s the draw,” he said. “Everyone’s got to have a cause.”",0.0

President Donald Trump, meanwhile, berated most of the nation’s governors as “weak” for not cracking down harder on the lawlessness. The country has been convulsed by angry demonstrations from coast to coast for the past week in some of the most widespread racial unrest in the U.S. since the 1960s. Spurred by the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis, protesters have taken to the streets to decry the killings of black people by police. While most of the demonstrations have been peaceful, others have descending into violence, leaving neighborhoods in shambles, stores ransacked and cars burned, despite curfews around the country and the deployment of thousands of National Guard members in at least 15 states. “We are a country that is scared,” said Sam Page, county executive in St. Louis County, Missouri, where the city of Ferguson has been synonymous with the Black Lives Matter movement since the 2014 death of Michael Brown, a black 18-year-old, during a confrontation with a white officer. “We are country that is angry. And we are a country that is holding out for the promise of justice for all.” In Minneapolis, Floyd’s brother, Terrence, made an emotional plea for peace at the site of where Floyd was pinned to pavement by an officer who put his knee on the handcuffed black’s man neck for several minutes. “Let’s switch it up ya’ll. Let’s switch it up. Do this peacefully, please,” Terrence Floyd said. The crowd chanted, “What’s his name? George Floyd” and “One down, three to go,” in reference to the four officers involved in the arrest. Officer Derek Chauvin has been charged with murder, but protesters are demanding that his colleagues be prosecuted, too. All four were fired. The gathering was part rally and part impromptu eulogy as Floyd urged people to stop the violence and use their power at the ballot box. “If I’m not over here messing up my community, then what are you all doing?” he said. “You all are doing nothing. Because that’s not going to bring my brother back at all.” Even as police in some places tried to calm tensions by kneeling or marching in solidarity, officers elsewhere were accused of the very type of harsh treatment at the heart of the unrest. In Fort Lauderdale, Florida, an officer was suspended for pushing a kneeling woman to the ground during a protest. In Atlanta, two officers were fired after bashing in the window of a car and using a stun gun on the occupants. In Los Angeles, a police SUV accelerated into several protesters, knocking two people to the ground. In New York, the police commissioner said about six incidents were being investigated by the department’s internal affairs bureau, including a weekend confrontation in Brooklyn in which two police vehicles appeared to plow through a group of protesters. In another incident, an officer pointed a gun at protesters, drawing condemnation from the mayor. “I think some of the actions of the NYPD have exacerbated the anger,” New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said. “There are videos of some NYPD actions that are very disturbing. There are videos of NYPD cars driving into a crowd that are very disturbing. Pulling a mask down off a person to pepper spray them. Throwing a woman to the ground. It’s on video! It’s on video!” New York Mayor Bill de Blasio said he was considering imposing a curfew on the nation’s biggest city after groups of people broke into Chanel, Prada and Rolex boutiques and electronics stores on Sunday night. At the same time, the mayor said the law-breaking in the city of 8.6 million people was being “fomented by a very small number of violent protesters.” Around the country, political leaders girded for the possibility of more of what unfolded over the weekend: protesters hurling rocks and Molotov cocktails at police in Philadelphia, setting a fire near the White House and smashing their way into Los Angeles stores, running off with as much as they could carry. At least 4,400 people have been arrested for offenses such as stealing, blocking highways and breaking curfew, according to a count by The Associated Press. Police officers and National Guard soldiers enforcing a curfew in Louisville, Kentucky, killed a man early Monday when they returned fire after someone in a large group shot at them, police said. In Indianapolis, two people were reported dead in bursts of downtown violence over the weekend, adding to deaths recorded in Detroit and Minneapolis. Trump told the nation’s governors in a video conference that they they “look like fools” for not deploying even more National Guard members. “Most of you are weak,” he said. He added: “You’ve got to arrest people, you have to track people, you have to put them in jail for 10 years and you’ll never see this stuff again.” Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, a Democrat, rejected Trump’s call for the use of force. He said he told Trump during the meeting: “No one is laughing here. We’re in pain. We’re crying.” Former Vice President Joe Biden, the Democratic presidential candidate, wrote a post online expressing empathy for those despairing about Floyd’s killing. On Monday, he met with community leaders at a black church in his hometown of Wilmington, Delaware. “The vice president came to hear from us.

His announcement came as police under federal command forced back peaceful demonstrators with tear gas so he could walk to a nearby church and pose with a Bible. Trump's bellicose rhetoric came as the nation convulsed through another round of violence over the death of George Floyd at a time when the country is already buckling under the coronavirus outbreak and the Depression-level unemployment it has caused. The president demanded an end to the heated protests in remarks from the White House Rose Garden and vowed to use more force to achieve that aim. If governors throughout the country do not deploy the National Guard in sufficient numbers to 'dominate the streets,' Trump said the U.S. military would step in to 'quickly solve the problem for them.' 'We have the greatest country in the world,' the president declared. 'We're going to keep it safe.' A military deployment by Trump to U.S. states would mark a stunning federal intervention rarely seen in modern American history. Yet the message Trump appeared to be sending with the brazen pushback of protesters outside the White House was that he sees few limits to what he is willing to do. Some around the president likened the moment to 1968, when Richard Nixon ran as the law-and-order candidate in the aftermath of a summer of riots, capturing the White House. But despite his efforts to portray himself as a political outsider, Trump is an incumbent who risks being held responsible for the violence. Minutes before Trump began speaking, police and National Guard soldiers began aggressively forcing back hundreds of peaceful protesters who had gathered in Lafayette Park, across the street from the White House, where they were chanting against police brutality and Floyd's death in Minneapolis. As Trump spoke, tear gas canisters could be heard exploding. Floyd died last week after he was pinned to the pavement by a police officer who put his knee on the handcuffed black man's neck until he stopped breathing. His death set off protests that spread from Minneapolis across America. His brother Terrence pleaded with protesters on Monday to remain peaceful. Five months before Election Day, the president made clear that he would stake his reelection efforts on convincing voters that his strong-arm approach was warranted to quell the most intense civil unrest since the 1960s. He made little effort to address the grievances of black Americans and others outraged by Floyd's death and the scourge of police brutality, undermining what his campaign had hoped would be increased appeal to African American voters. The scene in and around the White House on Monday night appeared to be carefully orchestrated. As the crowd of protesters grew, Attorney General William Barr arrived in Lafayette Park to look over at the demonstrations and the swarm of law enforcement. The sudden shift in tactics against the protesters was initially a mystery. Then, after finishing his Rose Garden remarks, Trump emerged from the White House gates and walked through the park to St. John's Church, where an office had been set on fire the previous night. Trump, who rarely attends church, held up a Bible and gathered a group of advisers "" all white "" to pose for photos. The moment was quickly decried by Trump's critics, with New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo saying the president 'used the military to push out a peaceful protest so he could have a photo op at a church."" 'It's all just a reality TV show for this president,"" he said on Twitter. 'Shameful.' Federal law permits presidents to dispatch the military into states to suppress an insurrection or if a state is defying federal law, legal experts said. But Trump's statements also set up an immediate conflict with officials in New York and other states who asserted that the president does not have the unilateral right to send in troops against the will of local governments. The country has been beset by angry demonstrations for the past week in some of the most widespread racial unrest in the U.S. since the 1960s. Spurred largely by Floyd's death, protesters have taken to the streets to decry the killings of black people by police. Minneapolis Officer Derek Chauvin has been charged with murder, but protesters are demanding that three of his colleagues be prosecuted, too. All four were fired. While most of the demonstrations have been peaceful, others have descended into violence, leaving neighborhoods in shambles, stores ransacked, windows broken and cars burned, despite curfews around the country and the deployment of thousands of National Guard members in at least 15 states. On Monday, demonstrations erupted from Philadelphia, where hundreds of protesters spilled onto a highway in the heart of the city, to Atlanta, where police fired tear gas at demonstrators, to Nashville, where more than 60 National Guard soldiers put down their riot shields at the request of peaceful protesters who had gathered in front of Tennessee's state Capitol to honor Floyd. Two people were killed during protests in the Chicago suburb of Cicero, authorities said, but provided no details. In Louisville, Kentucky, riot police firing tear gas scattered several hundred protesters from downtown, violently capping a day of mostly peaceful protests. A vehicle plowed through a group of law enforcement officers at a demonstration in Buffalo, New York, injuring at least two. Video from the scene showed the vehicle accelerating through an intersection shortly after officers apparently tackled a protester and handcuffed him. The officers were hospitalized in stable condition, authorities said. In New York City, where nightfall has brought widespread scenes of destruction, large crowds rallied peacefully in Times Square and Brooklyn during the day. Then, in early evening, looters rushed into a Nike store in Manhattan and protesters smashed storefront windows near Rockefeller Center. Video posted on social media showed some protesters arguing with people breaking windows, urging them to stop. The city has already endured immense commercial damage from the unrest. On Monday, rioters got through the doors of the city's flagship Macy's store, famous for its Thanksgiving Day parade, and police later pulled at least two handcuffed men out of the store and put them into a van. By that time, most of the the street was littered with broken glass. In Washington, protesters continued marching peacefully through Washington hours after being forced from Lafayette park and past the 7 p.m. curfew. Eventually, within sight of the Capitol building, the marchers were turned back by law enforcement officers using tear gas, pellets and low-flying helicopters kicking up debris. As they dispersed, some protesters smashed windows at a nearby office building. Earlier Monday, Trump told the nation's governors in a video conference that they 'look like fools' for not deploying even more National Guard troops. 'Most of you are weak,' he said. He added: 'You've got to arrest people, you have to track people, you have to put them in jail for 10 years and you'll never see this stuff again.' Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, a Democrat, dismissed Trump's comments as the 'rantings of an insecure man trying to look strong after building his entire political career on racism.' Former Vice President Joe Biden, the Democratic presidential candidate, vowed to address institutional racism in his first 100 days in office.

His announcement came as police under federal command forced back peaceful demonstrators with tear gas so he could walk to a nearby church and pose with a Bible. Trump's bellicose rhetoric came as the nation convulsed through another round of violence over the death of George Floyd at a time when the country is already buckling under the coronavirus outbreak and the Depression-level unemployment it has caused. The president demanded an end to the heated protests in remarks from the White House Rose Garden and vowed to use more force to achieve that aim. If governors throughout the country do not deploy the National Guard in sufficient numbers to 'dominate the streets,' Trump said the U.S. military would step in to 'quickly solve the problem for them.' 'We have the greatest country in the world,' the president declared. 'We're going to keep it safe.' A military deployment by Trump to U.S. states would mark a stunning federal intervention rarely seen in modern American history. Yet the message Trump appeared to be sending with the brazen pushback of protesters outside the White House was that he sees few limits to what he is willing to do. Some around the president likened the moment to 1968, when Richard Nixon ran as the law-and-order candidate in the aftermath of a summer of riots, capturing the White House. But despite his efforts to portray himself as a political outsider, Trump is an incumbent who risks being held responsible for the violence. Minutes before Trump began speaking, police and National Guard soldiers began aggressively forcing back hundreds of peaceful protesters who had gathered in Lafayette Park, across the street from the White House, where they were chanting against police brutality and Floyd's death in Minneapolis. As Trump spoke, tear gas canisters could be heard exploding. Floyd died last week after he was pinned to the pavement by a police officer who put his knee on the handcuffed black man's neck until he stopped breathing. His death set off protests that spread from Minneapolis across America. His brother Terrence pleaded with protesters on Monday to remain peaceful. Five months before Election Day, the president made clear that he would stake his reelection efforts on convincing voters that his strong-arm approach was warranted to quell the most intense civil unrest since the 1960s. He made little effort to address the grievances of black Americans and others outraged by Floyd's death and the scourge of police brutality, undermining what his campaign had hoped would be increased appeal to African American voters. The scene in and around the White House on Monday night appeared to be carefully orchestrated. As the crowd of protesters grew, Attorney General William Barr arrived in Lafayette Park to look over at the demonstrations and the swarm of law enforcement. The sudden shift in tactics against the protesters was initially a mystery. Then, after finishing his Rose Garden remarks, Trump emerged from the White House gates and walked through the park to St. John's Church, where an office had been set on fire the previous night. Trump, who rarely attends church, held up a Bible and gathered a group of advisers "" all white "" to pose for photos. The moment was quickly decried by Trump's critics, with New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo saying the president 'used the military to push out a peaceful protest so he could have a photo op at a church."" 'It's all just a reality TV show for this president,"" he said on Twitter. 'Shameful.' Federal law permits presidents to dispatch the military into states to suppress an insurrection or if a state is defying federal law, legal experts said. But Trump's statements also set up an immediate conflict with officials in New York and other states who asserted that the president does not have the unilateral right to send in troops against the will of local governments. The country has been beset by angry demonstrations for the past week in some of the most widespread racial unrest in the U.S. since the 1960s. Spurred largely by Floyd's death, protesters have taken to the streets to decry the killings of black people by police. Minneapolis Officer Derek Chauvin has been charged with murder, but protesters are demanding that three of his colleagues be prosecuted, too. All four were fired. While most of the demonstrations have been peaceful, others have descended into violence, leaving neighborhoods in shambles, stores ransacked, windows broken and cars burned, despite curfews around the country and the deployment of thousands of National Guard members in at least 15 states. On Monday, demonstrations erupted from Philadelphia, where hundreds of protesters spilled onto a highway in the heart of the city, to Atlanta, where police fired tear gas at demonstrators, to Nashville, where more than 60 National Guard soldiers put down their riot shields at the request of peaceful protesters who had gathered in front of Tennessee's state Capitol to honor Floyd. Two people were killed during protests in the Chicago suburb of Cicero, authorities said, but provided no details. In Louisville, Kentucky, riot police firing tear gas scattered several hundred protesters from downtown, violently capping a day of mostly peaceful protests. A vehicle plowed through a group of law enforcement officers at a demonstration in Buffalo, New York, injuring at least two. Video from the scene showed the vehicle accelerating through an intersection shortly after officers apparently tackled a protester and handcuffed him. The officers were hospitalized in stable condition, authorities said. In New York City, where nightfall has brought widespread scenes of destruction, large crowds rallied peacefully in Times Square and Brooklyn during the day. Then, in early evening, looters rushed into a Nike store in Manhattan and protesters smashed storefront windows near Rockefeller Center. Video posted on social media showed some protesters arguing with people breaking windows, urging them to stop. The city has already endured immense commercial damage from the unrest. On Monday, rioters got through the doors of the city's flagship Macy's store, famous for its Thanksgiving Day parade, and police later pulled at least two handcuffed men out of the store and put them into a van. By that time, most of the the street was littered with broken glass. In Washington, protesters continued marching peacefully through Washington hours after being forced from Lafayette park and past the 7 p.m. curfew. Eventually, within sight of the Capitol building, the marchers were turned back by law enforcement officers using tear gas, pellets and low-flying helicopters kicking up debris. As they dispersed, some protesters smashed windows at a nearby office building. Earlier Monday, Trump told the nation's governors in a video conference that they 'look like fools' for not deploying even more National Guard troops. 'Most of you are weak,' he said. He added: 'You've got to arrest people, you have to track people, you have to put them in jail for 10 years and you'll never see this stuff again.' Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, a Democrat, dismissed Trump's comments as the 'rantings of an insecure man trying to look strong after building his entire political career on racism.' Former Vice President Joe Biden, the Democratic presidential candidate, vowed to address institutional racism in his first 100 days in office. He met in person with black leaders in Delaware and also held a virtual meeting with big-city mayors. Biden said hate emerges 'when you have somebody in power who breathes oxygen into the hate.'

Over the years, she’s reported from the front lines at rallies and demonstrations in an effort to document what was happening. What occurred last week in the Twin Cities region of Minnesota was different and unlike anything she’s experienced previously. A Newport resident since 2005, Enger was in her native Minnesota to visit family and ""escape COVID,"" she said, after her photography business, Studio Newport, was considered non-essential and forced to close because of the pandemic. On May 25, a black man named George Floyd died while in police custody and video of the incident soon surfaced. It showed Minneapolis Police Department officer Derek Chauvin, who is white, kneeling on the neck of Floyd, who begged for his life and repeatedly uttered the phrase, ""I can’t breath."" Chauvin has been charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. In the wake of Floyd’s death, people took to the streets of Minneapolis and nearby St. Paul, where violent and destructive riots erupted. Staying at her parents’ home in the suburb of Edina, Enger grabbed her camera and convinced her sister to head to the area. ""I’m of the mindset that once you’re a reporter, you’re always a reporter,"" she said in a phone interview on Monday morning. ""I felt it was important to bear witness to the riots. Anyone who saw that video, you can’t help by have an immense sense of outrage for what happened to George Floyd."" Enger has been documenting her experiences on her Facebook page, with one post being shared more than 1,500 times. At first, Enger and her sister, both of whom are white, were fearful of the rioters, but before long, it was the police who were on the attack, she said. Enger was taking pictures of looters emerging from a Verizon store when an officer spotted her. ""He told me to get back, to get back on the grass, which I did,"" Enger said. ""The situation was being mitigated, then the officer turned around, looked at my sister and I and threw — he didn’t throw the tear gas at the rioters — he threw it directly at us."" The tear gas canister landed ""about a half a foot from my sister and that exploded,"" Enger said. ""I thought I was dying,"" said Enger, who suffers from asthma. ""It’s like you’re underwater and you’re trying to take a breath. I was following the screams of my sister to get out of the gas clouds."" When Enger had previously covered protests, she said she always looked at police ""as an ally."" In St. Paul, Enger said police were actively targeting media and the people who ""are trying to tell the story."" ""It was the first time I’d ever seen or experienced, and unfortunately witnessed, a different side of police that I as a white woman had never experienced,"" she said. A woman approached Enger and began to pour milk into her eyes to soothe the burning. ""She was like a hero out of nowhere,"" Enger said. She continued to photograph the scene and captured an image of a man who too had been hit with tear gas, milk running down his face. ""You can see in his face how agonizing it is,"" Enger said. ""It was quite horrific."" Enger wanted to make it clear the rioters weren’t just those angry about the George Floyd killing. She said there were ""agitators, white supremacists and a lot of different groups"" present. For the most part, it was the big-box stores being targeted over the small businesses, she said. The neighborhood where George Floyd was killed, primarily a black community in Minneapolis, was spared, Enger said. There, instead of violent protests, peaceful demonstrations ruled the day and she was there to capture the moments. She even brought her mother, Kathleen, to experience it. She said those non-violent rallies were filled with people of all colors and backgrounds. One of the speakers was Fred Hampton Jr., the son of Black Panther Party leader Fred Hampton, who was shot and killed by Chicago police in 1969. Like his father, Hampton Jr. is an activist and, according to Enger, he told the crowd, ""This is not a riot, this is a rebellion. Minneapolis will be at the center of a revolution."" The Black Panther Party launched a permanent chapter in the city, and Enger said she has volunteered to follow the group and document the effort after meeting with Hampton Jr. Minnesota on a whole isn’t a racist state, Enger said, but what has transpired there goes to show how far we need to come as a country. ""This is a problem everywhere,"" she said. What she saw during those non-violent rallies brought a sense of pride. ""I’m proud of my city. I’ve never been more proud of Minneapolis."" Enger was scheduled to return to Newport next week, but said she’ll stay through June because ""people need to see what’s happening."" ""This has been a life-changing experience,"" she said. sbarrett@newportri.com",0.0

On April 29, 1992, thousands in the city's largely minority south side took to the streets after an all-white jury acquitted four white police officers of attacking King, a black driver, after a traffic stop. The outcome outraged a community that watched video of King being beaten with police batons, shot with stun guns and stomped on. By the time order was restored, rioting had spread across much of LA for five days, leaving more than 60 people dead, over 2,300 injured and $1 billion in property damage. Smoke enveloped the city after hundreds of buildings burned to the ground. The losses are far higher than in protests over Floyd's killing that have swept the nation for days, devolving into people setting buildings and police cars on fire, smashing their way into stores and hurling rocks and bottles at officers. Police have responded with tear gas, rubber bullets and thousands of arrests, many of them in LA. Kerman Maddox was a young radio reporter who lived just a block from one of the flashpoints in the 1992 riots. 'I had a chance to see a lot and observe a lot, and I was hoping I would never see that again,' said Maddox, who is black. But he also thought he'd never see another video recorded by a bystander as violent as the one of King's beating, Maddox said. Not until he watched footage of white Minneapolis police Officer Derek Chauvin pressing a knee into Floyd's neck for several minutes even after he stopped moving and pleading for air. 'I still have a hard time seeing that,"" said Maddox, who's a public affairs consultant. He said the chaotic protests it triggered did not entirely surprise him, soon after white men were arrested in May in the February killing of black Georgia jogger Ahmaud Arbery and other incidents. 'The problem is this is 2020, Rodney King happened almost 30 years ago and a lot of people see this stuff is still going on,"" Maddox said. ""You're upset, and you're angry, and you're perplexed because you're trying to figure out what do we have to do for this to end.' To see Los Angeles erupt in chaos for the second time in her life has been devastating, says Aurea Montes-Rodriguez, executive vice president of the Community Coalition South Los Angeles. As a high school student, she had to walk past burning buildings and looters after her school abruptly suspended bus service during the 1992 riots. The experience inspired her to dedicate her career to public service after earning a master's degree from the University of California, Los Angeles. 'I felt that what I was seeing on TV the first night and when I walked through the fires the second day was a civil unrest by people who were fed up believing that the legal system, that the justice system, was going to work for our community,' she said on the 25th anniversary of the King riots in 2017. That's still the problem, she said Sunday, not only in Los Angeles but in other U.S. cities. 'I'm deeply concerned and heartbroken that this is happening in our city, and worse, that it's happening in different parts of the country because our elected officials refuse to hear or see the devastation that families are hearing and experiencing,' Montes-Rodriguez said. Civil rights scholar Jody Armour has noticed that people of color now protesting are often joined by white people, something he didn't see during the 1992 uprising. That could be an indication, he says, that more white people, realizing black people were not exaggerating when they spoke of the dangers of driving or walking while black, have begun to develop an empathy and to stand with African Americans against oppression. 'Racial discrimination today isn't the old KKK racism, but racism of indifference,' says Armour, a black University of Southern California professor who has written and lectured on racial justice, criminal justice and the rule of law. 'You're not motivated by racial animus or spite, you just don't feel the pain of the out-group members as you do for your in-group members."" Still, he cautioned real change has never been easy and is often violent, from the Civil War to the 1960s civil rights movement. That it has taken this long to get to that point is especially frustrating to Los Angeles County Supervisor Janice Hahn, who was 13 when the Watts riots erupted near her home in 1965 after white officers got into a scuffle with a drunken driving suspect in the city's racially segregated Watts neighborhood. More than 30 people were killed. While there were substantial efforts to rebuild communities after both uprisings, she said Sunday that it's clear that ""despite what we have done, what has still not changed is the systemic racism that we're seeing across the country as it relates to the interaction between law enforcement and unarmed black men.' She said she's encouraged that several police chiefs have spoken out against Floyd's death. In New Jersey, for instance, Camden County Police Chief Joe Wysocki joined protesters in a march. 'I think that's where it has to start, we have to reform throughout this country our police departments,"" said Hahn, who is white and whose late father, Kenneth Hahn, was a revered figure in the largely black community he represented on the county Board of Supervisors for 40 years. 'I'm 68 years old,"" she said ruefully. ""My hope is to see in my lifetime a real change. So that I don't go through one of these again.'",0.0

(AP) "" Joe Biden vowed to address institutional racism in his first 100 days in office as he sought to elevate his voice Monday in the exploding national debate over racism and police brutality. The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee offered emotional support and promised bold action during an in-person discussion with black leaders in Delaware and a subsequent virtual meeting with big-city mayors who are grappling with racial tensions and frustrated by a lack of federal support. 'Hate just hides. It doesn't go away, and when you have somebody in power who breathes oxygen into the hate under the rocks, it comes out from under the rocks,' Biden told more than a dozen African American leaders gathered at a church in downtown Wilmington, his face mask lowered around his chin as he spoke. Without offering specifics, he promised to 'deal with institutional racism' and set up a police oversight body in his first 100 days in office, if elected. The former vice president also said he'd be releasing an economic plan focused on education, housing and 'access to capital"" and investments, especially for minority Americans, later this month. 'I really do believe that the blinders have been taken off. I think this tidal wave is moving,' Biden told the mayors of Atlanta, Chicago, Los Angeles and St. Paul, Minnesota. 'I realize we've got to do something big, we can do it, and everyone will benefit from it.' Largely sheltering in place amid the coronavirus, Biden has struggled in recent weeks to be heard from his makeshift home TV studio over the noise of dueling national crises. But after another night of violent protests, he ventured out into public for the second time in two days and just the third time since the pandemic arrived in mid-March. His hopeful and collaborative approach marked a sharp contrast to that of President Donald Trump, who has made little effort to unify the country. The Republican president slammed governors as 'weak' during a video teleconference on Monday and demanded tougher crackdowns on protesters. Trump also lashed out at Biden on Twitter, writing that 'Sleepy Joe Biden's people are so Radical Left that they are working to get the Anarchists out of jail, and probably more.' Biden's softer style may foreshadow how he presents himself in the five months before the presidential election, emphasizing calm and competence as a contrast to a mercurial president. It is an approach that carries the risk of being drowned out by Trump's much louder voice. On Monday evening, Trump declared himself 'the president of law and order' from the White House as military police and law enforcement fired tear gas and cleared protesters from nearby Lafayette Park. Biden made no mention of the unfolding events during an online fundraiser that took place at the same time, though he talked at length about persistent racism in the U.S. He plans to deliver remarks on the unrest gripping the U.S. on Tuesday in Philadelphia. In the early moments of Monday's gathering at the Bethel AME church in Wilmington, Biden listened quietly and took notes. All the attendees, including Biden, wore face masks but lowered them as they spoke. 'The vice president came to hear from us. This is a homeboy,' pastor Sylvester Beaman said before everyone bowed their heads in prayer. Biden's standing with the black community weighs heavily as he works to deny Trump a second term. African Americans rescued Biden's flailing primary campaign, but it's unclear if they will turn out for him in large numbers in November. 'I want to make something clear. I don't expect anything from the black community,"" Biden said Monday, insisting he has never taken its support for granted. The former vice president has been doing cleanup since telling a prominent black radio host a week and a half ago that African Americans who back Trump 'ain't black.' Yet the mayors who spoke with Biden, three of whom are black, were clearly frustrated and angry with Trump, who has offered military support to address violent protests while denying them federal support to address the coronavirus fallout and repeatedly attacking them on social media. 'To see the president of the United States say that he's going to send the military into our communities but hadn't mentioned sending a single dime of support into our communities, speaks to where we are in America,' said Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms. Much of Biden's campaign strategy centers on trying to draw a contrast with Trump on temperament and values. He has called the White House contest a battle for the soul of the nation and has been particularly forceful in condemning Trump's handling of moments of racial tension. In an election that is likely to be a referendum on the sitting president, some Biden aides say privately that the best plan may be to let Trump do himself in. Yet there is also a recognition that Biden needs to do more than simply wait for voters who may be turned off by Trump to turn toward him. Some Democrats who have criticized Biden for not being more visible during the onset of the coronavirus said he is making the right moves now. 'I'm sure they have some reluctance, understandably, right now to politicize it. That's not who he is,"" said Democratic strategist James Carville.

1622588610,2020-06-01 14:49:05,Facebook employees speak out against company over Trump,https://www.newportri.com/ZZ/news/20200601/facebook-employees-speak-out-against-company-over-trump?rssfeed=true,en,True,,662950,Newport Daily News,http://www.newportdailynews.com/ee/newportdailynews/index.php,"OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) "" Facebook employees are using Twitter and Facebook's internal communications tools to register their frustration over CEO Mark Zuckerberg's decision to leave up posts by President Donald Trump that suggested protesters in Minneapolis could be shot. Twitter flagged and demoted Trump's tweet about the protests when he used the phrase 'when the looting starts the shooting starts.' Facebook has let it stand, and Zuckerberg explained his reasoning in a Facebook post Friday. 'I know many people are upset that we've left the President's posts up, but our position is that we should enable as much expression as possible unless it will cause imminent risk of specific harms or dangers spelled out in clear policies,' Zuckerberg wrote. Angry demonstrations have spread across the U.S. over the past week, creating some of the most widespread racial unrest since the 1960s. The protests, which have been met by violent police action in many cities, were spurred by the death of George Floyd, a black man who died after he was pinned to the pavement by an officer who put his knee on the handcuffed man's neck until he stopped breathing. Trump's comment evoked the civil-rights era by borrowing a phrase used in 1967 by Miami's police chief to warn of an aggressive police response to unrest in black neighborhoods. On Monday, dozens of Facebook employees staged a virtual 'walkout' to protest the company's decision not to touch the Trump posts according to a report in the New York Times, which cited anonymous senior employees at Facebook. The Times report says dozens of Facebook workers 'took the day off by logging into Facebook's systems and requesting time off to support protesters across the country."" Workers also expressed frustration in other ways, including posting on Twitter, speaking to managers and writing on Facebook's internal communication network. Though virtual, this was the first time that Facebook workers have staged a walkout in the company's history. Employees at the social media giant have been less outspoken than their counterparts at other tech companies such as Google and Twitter. 'I work at Facebook and I am not proud of how we're showing up. The majority of coworkers I've spoken to feel the same way. We are making our voice heard,' tweeted Jason Toff, a director of product management at Facebook who's been at the company for a year. Toff, who has a verified Twitter account, had 131,400 'likes' and thousands of retweets of his comment. He did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment on Monday. 'I don't know what to do, but I know doing nothing is not acceptable. I'm a FB employee that completely disagrees with Mark's decision to do nothing about Trump's recent posts, which clearly incite violence. I'm not alone inside of FB. There isn't a neutral position on racism,' Facebook design manager Jason Stirman tweeted. Stirman did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Monday. Sara Zhang, a product designer at the company, tweeted that Facebook's 'decision to not act on posts that incite violence ignores other options to keep our community safe. The policy pigeon holes us into addressing harmful user-facing content in two ways: keep content up or take it down.' 'I believe that this is a self-imposed constraint and implore leadership to revisit the solution,' she continued. Zhang declined to comment to The Associated Press. 'We recognize the pain many of our people are feeling right now, especially our Black community. We encourage employees to speak openly when they disagree with leadership. As we face additional difficult decisions around content ahead, we'll continue seeking their honest feedback,' Facebook spokeswoman Liz Bourgeois said in a statement Monday. Facebook moved a weekly employee question and answer session with executives to Tuesday from this coming Thursday to respond to workers' concerns. Late Sunday, Zuckerberg again posted on Facebook, pledging a $10 million donation to racial justice groups. But he made no mention of Trump's posts. Instead, he highlighted Facebook's role in the spreading of the video of Floyd's death. 'We need to know George Floyd's name. But it's clear Facebook also has more work to do to keep people safe and ensure our systems don't amplify bias,' Zuckerberg wrote. Twitter has historically taken stronger stances than its larger rival, including a complete ban on political advertisements that Twitter announced last November. That's partly because Facebook, a much larger company with a broader audience,targeted by regulators over its size and power, has more to lose. And partly because the companies' CEOs don't always see eye to eye on their role in society. Over the weekend, Twitter changed the background and logo of its main Twitter account to black from its usual blue in support of the Black Lives Matter protesters and added a #blacklivesmatter hashtag. Facebook did the same with its own logo on its site, though without the hashtag.",0.0

Gina M. Raimondo in her daily briefing on Monday afternoon. “There’s going to be a lot of activity in Rhode Island that we haven’t seen in a couple of months,” said Raimondo of this week, where all state parks and beaches are now open while businesses such as salons, gyms, fitness centers and child care centers are reopening for the first time since mid-March. Over this past weekend, Raimondo said the state was successful in keeping up with health guidelines. Some state parks, however, such as Lincoln Woods, were closed to visitors for a period of time over the weekend due to having to break up large congregations. “We have to do a better job,” urged Raimondo. - Advertisement - According to Raimondo, the R.I. Department of Business Regulations reported 95% of customers and nearly 100% of employees were wearing face masks over the weekend at businesses that were open. However, the governor said the state could do better on the percentage of businesses that have filled out their COVID-19 Control Plans. “Only 70% of businesses have filled out their COVID Control Plans,” said Raimondo. “Seventy percent is not okay.” Health officials on Monday reported just two new deaths in the state due to COVID-19 and 67 more cases, bringing the latter total to 14,991. The state has reported a total of 720 fatalities related to the new coronavirus. The number of new cases reported on Monday is the lowest daily total since April 2. “Our COVID-19 numbers have been stable,” said R.I. Department of Health Director Dr. Nicole Alexander-Scott. “We are not out of the woods yet, but we are moving in the right direction.” The state conducted 2,183 more tests on Sunday, bringing the total to 156,835. Raimondo said Sunday’s positivity rate was 3%, which is below the 10% mark to continue reopening the state. “Those are very encouraging statistics,” said Raimondo, turning her attention to testing in Central Falls, Woonsocket and parts of Providence. “But, we still have certain communities that have positive rates that are too high.” Current hospitalizations due to the virus total 195, a decline from 206 one day prior. Of those hospitalized, 46 are in intensive care units, while 29 are on ventilators, both unchanged from the previous day. Raimondo addressed Saturday’s peaceful demonstration in Providence amid the death of another Black man death while in police custody, where more than 1,000 people protested. She said nearly all of these demonstrators were wearing masks while socially distancing and were peaceful. “It made me proud to be a Rhode Islander,” said Raimondo. However, unrelated rioters have vandalized property and looted from businesses in cities throughout the country. In Rhode Island, the State House experienced some vandalism that was not “particularly extensive,” as the Governor stated in a Monday morning call with reporters and said that State Police are handling the investigation. In a call with President Donald Trump today, which Raimondo participated in, he told Governors to be tougher with violent protestors by “dominating.” “We have to maintain peace,” said Raimondo. “But there’s a lot of angry people and it’s hard to blame them.” This story has been updated to include details from the governor’s press conference.",0.0

Gina M. Raimondo said she is “recommitting” herself to take action to eliminate racism and inequality. Protests had lasted peacefully for hours in cities such as nearby Boston and New York, until nightfall when violence exploded in pockets for the third consecutive night. Windows were smashed by bricks, stores were looted, and graffiti was sprayed with obscenities directed toward police officers. The protests come following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis while in police custody and in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. “COVID-19 has brought to the forefront, the racial inequalities that have existed for a long time,” said Raimondo in a Monday morning conference call with reporters. “We’ve seen the real human cost of this inequality.” The protest in Providence on May 30 was peaceful for several hours, while those demonstrating were wearing face masks and social distancing, according to the governor, until rioters vandalized the Statehouse. The governor said damage was not “particularly extensive” and that R.I. State Police are handling the investigation. She said that those responsible “will be held accountable.” Raimondo called Floyd’s death and the past few days a “wake-up call.” - Advertisement - “We’ve had an equity-central approach. But apparently, we aren’t doing enough,” said Raimondo. “We all have to summon our sense of hope and let that hope drive us to a renewed commitment to take action on every level to eliminate racism and inequality.” Raimondo said much of her future action to help eliminate inequality will stem from “more listening” of younger people, such as teenagers and those in their 20s. “I’m committed to engaging and not dismissing,” said Raimondo.

On April 29, 1992, thousands in the city's largely minority south side took to the streets after an all-white jury acquitted four white police officers of attacking King, a black driver, after a traffic stop. The outcome outraged a community that watched video of King being beaten with police batons, shot with stun guns and stomped on. By the time order was restored, rioting had spread across much of LA for five days, leaving more than 60 people dead, over 2,300 injured and $1 billion in property damage. Smoke enveloped the city after hundreds of buildings burned to the ground. The losses are far higher than in protests over Floyd's killing that have swept the nation for days, devolving into people setting buildings and police cars on fire, smashing their way into stores and hurling rocks and bottles at officers. Police have responded with tear gas, rubber bullets and thousands of arrests, many of them in LA. Kerman Maddox was a young radio reporter who lived just a block from one of the flashpoints in the 1992 riots. 'I had a chance to see a lot and observe a lot, and I was hoping I would never see that again,' said Maddox, who is black. But he also thought he'd never see another video recorded by a bystander as violent as the one of King's beating, Maddox said. Not until he watched footage of white Minneapolis police Officer Derek Chauvin pressing a knee into Floyd's neck for several minutes even after he stopped moving and pleading for air. 'I still have a hard time seeing that,"" said Maddox, who's a public affairs consultant. He said the chaotic protests it triggered did not entirely surprise him, soon after white men were arrested in May in the February killing of black Georgia jogger Ahmaud Arbery and other incidents.

Trump also lashed out at Biden on Twitter, writing that 'Sleepy Joe Biden's people are so Radical Left that they are working to get the Anarchists out of jail, and probably more.' Biden's softer style may foreshadow how he presents himself in the five months before the presidential election, emphasizing calm and competence as a contrast to a mercurial president. It is an approach that carries the risk of being drowned out by Trump's much louder voice. On Monday evening, Trump declared himself 'the president of law and order' from the White House as military police and law enforcement fired tear gas and cleared protesters from nearby Lafayette Park. Biden made no mention of the unfolding events during an online fundraiser that took place at the same time, though he talked at length about persistent racism in the U.S. He plans to deliver remarks on the unrest gripping the U.S. on Tuesday in Philadelphia. In the early moments of Monday's gathering at the Bethel AME church in Wilmington, Biden listened quietly and took notes. All the attendees, including Biden, wore face masks but lowered them as they spoke. 'The vice president came to hear from us. This is a homeboy,' pastor Sylvester Beaman said before everyone bowed their heads in prayer. Biden's standing with the black community weighs heavily as he works to deny Trump a second term. African Americans rescued Biden's flailing primary campaign, but it's unclear if they will turn out for him in large numbers in November. 'I want to make something clear. I don't expect anything from the black community,"" Biden said Monday, insisting he has never taken its support for granted. The former vice president has been doing cleanup since telling a prominent black radio host a week and a half ago that African Americans who back Trump 'ain't black.' Yet the mayors who spoke with Biden, three of whom are black, were clearly frustrated and angry with Trump, who has offered military support to address violent protests while denying them federal support to address the coronavirus fallout and repeatedly attacking them on social media. 'To see the president of the United States say that he's going to send the military into our communities but hadn't mentioned sending a single dime of support into our communities, speaks to where we are in America,' said Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms. Much of Biden's campaign strategy centers on trying to draw a contrast with Trump on temperament and values. He has called the White House contest a battle for the soul of the nation and has been particularly forceful in condemning Trump's handling of moments of racial tension. In an election that is likely to be a referendum on the sitting president, some Biden aides say privately that the best plan may be to let Trump do himself in. Yet there is also a recognition that Biden needs to do more than simply wait for voters who may be turned off by Trump to turn toward him. Some Democrats who have criticized Biden for not being more visible during the onset of the coronavirus said he is making the right moves now. 'I'm sure they have some reluctance, understandably, right now to politicize it. That's not who he is,"" said Democratic strategist James Carville.

On April 29, 1992, thousands in the city's largely minority south side took to the streets after an all-white jury acquitted four white police officers of attacking King, a black driver, after a traffic stop. The outcome outraged a community that watched video of King being beaten with police batons, shot with stun guns and stomped on. By the time order was restored, rioting had spread across much of LA for five days, leaving more than 60 people dead, over 2,300 injured and $1 billion in property damage. Smoke enveloped the city after hundreds of buildings burned to the ground. The losses are far higher than in protests over Floyd's killing that have swept the nation for days, devolving into people setting buildings and police cars on fire, smashing their way into stores and hurling rocks and bottles at officers. Police have responded with tear gas, rubber bullets and thousands of arrests, many of them in LA. Kerman Maddox was a young radio reporter who lived just a block from one of the flashpoints in the 1992 riots. 'I had a chance to see a lot and observe a lot, and I was hoping I would never see that again,' said Maddox, who is black. But he also thought he'd never see another video recorded by a bystander as violent as the one of King's beating, Maddox said. Not until he watched footage of white Minneapolis police Officer Derek Chauvin pressing a knee into Floyd's neck for several minutes even after he stopped moving and pleading for air. 'I still have a hard time seeing that,"" said Maddox, who's a public affairs consultant. He said the chaotic protests it triggered did not entirely surprise him, soon after white men were arrested in May in the February killing of black Georgia jogger Ahmaud Arbery and other incidents. 'The problem is this is 2020, Rodney King happened almost 30 years ago and a lot of people see this stuff is still going on,"" Maddox said. ""You're upset, and you're angry, and you're perplexed because you're trying to figure out what do we have to do for this to end.' To see Los Angeles erupt in chaos for the second time in her life has been devastating, says Aurea Montes-Rodriguez, executive vice president of the Community Coalition South Los Angeles. As a high school student, she had to walk past burning buildings and looters after her school abruptly suspended bus service during the 1992 riots. The experience inspired her to dedicate her career to public service after earning a master's degree from the University of California, Los Angeles. 'I felt that what I was seeing on TV the first night and when I walked through the fires the second day was a civil unrest by people who were fed up believing that the legal system, that the justice system, was going to work for our community,' she said on the 25th anniversary of the King riots in 2017. That's still the problem, she said Sunday, not only in Los Angeles but in other U.S. cities. 'I'm deeply concerned and heartbroken that this is happening in our city, and worse, that it's happening in different parts of the country because our elected officials refuse to hear or see the devastation that families are hearing and experiencing,' Montes-Rodriguez said. Civil rights scholar Jody Armour has noticed that people of color now protesting are often joined by white people, something he didn't see during the 1992 uprising. That could be an indication, he says, that more white people, realizing black people were not exaggerating when they spoke of the dangers of driving or walking while black, have begun to develop an empathy and to stand with African Americans against oppression. 'Racial discrimination today isn't the old KKK racism, but racism of indifference,' says Armour, a black University of Southern California professor who has written and lectured on racial justice, criminal justice and the rule of law. 'You're not motivated by racial animus or spite, you just don't feel the pain of the out-group members as you do for your in-group members.""

That it has taken this long to get to that point is especially frustrating to Los Angeles County Supervisor Janice Hahn, who was 13 when the Watts riots erupted near her home in 1965 after white officers got into a scuffle with a drunken driving suspect in the city's racially segregated Watts neighborhood. More than 30 people were killed. While there were substantial efforts to rebuild communities after both uprisings, she said Sunday that it's clear that ""despite what we have done, what has still not changed is the systemic racism that we're seeing across the country as it relates to the interaction between law enforcement and unarmed black men.'

(AP) "" Facebook employees are using Twitter and Facebook's internal communications tools to register their frustration over CEO Mark Zuckerberg's decision to leave up posts by President Donald Trump that suggested protesters in Minneapolis could be shot. Twitter flagged and demoted Trump's tweet about the protests when he used the phrase 'when the looting starts the shooting starts.' Facebook has let it stand, and Zuckerberg explained his reasoning in a Facebook post Friday. 'I know many people are upset that we've left the President's posts up, but our position is that we should enable as much expression as possible unless it will cause imminent risk of specific harms or dangers spelled out in clear policies,' Zuckerberg wrote. Angry demonstrations have spread across the U.S. over the past week, creating some of the most widespread racial unrest since the 1960s. The protests, which have been met by violent police action in many cities, were spurred by the death of George Floyd, a black man who died after he was pinned to the pavement by an officer who put his knee on the handcuffed man's neck until he stopped breathing. Trump's comment evoked the civil-rights era by borrowing a phrase used in 1967 by Miami's police chief to warn of an aggressive police response to unrest in black neighborhoods. On Monday, dozens of Facebook employees staged a virtual 'walkout' to protest the company's decision not to touch the Trump posts according to a report in the New York Times, which cited anonymous senior employees at Facebook. The Times report says dozens of Facebook workers 'took the day off by logging into Facebook's systems and requesting time off to support protesters across the country."" Workers also expressed frustration in other ways, including posting on Twitter, speaking to managers and writing on Facebook's internal communication network. Though virtual, this was the first time that Facebook workers have staged a walkout in the company's history. Employees at the social media giant have been less outspoken than their counterparts at other tech companies such as Google and Twitter. 'I work at Facebook and I am not proud of how we're showing up. The majority of coworkers I've spoken to feel the same way. We are making our voice heard,' tweeted Jason Toff, a director of product management at Facebook who's been at the company for a year. Toff, who has a verified Twitter account, had 131,400 'likes' and thousands of retweets of his comment. He did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment on Monday. 'I don't know what to do, but I know doing nothing is not acceptable. I'm a FB employee that completely disagrees with Mark's decision to do nothing about Trump's recent posts, which clearly incite violence. I'm not alone inside of FB. There isn't a neutral position on racism,' Facebook design manager Jason Stirman tweeted. Stirman did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Monday. Sara Zhang, a product designer at the company, tweeted that Facebook's 'decision to not act on posts that incite violence ignores other options to keep our community safe. The policy pigeon holes us into addressing harmful user-facing content in two ways: keep content up or take it down.' 'I believe that this is a self-imposed constraint and implore leadership to revisit the solution,' she continued. Zhang declined to comment to The Associated Press. 'We recognize the pain many of our people are feeling right now, especially our Black community. We encourage employees to speak openly when they disagree with leadership. As we face additional difficult decisions around content ahead, we'll continue seeking their honest feedback,' Facebook spokeswoman Liz Bourgeois said in a statement Monday. Facebook moved a weekly employee question and answer session with executives to Tuesday from this coming Thursday to respond to workers' concerns.

Health experts fear carriers of coronavirus, which causes the disease, with no symptoms could unwittingly infect others at protests where social distancing is simply not taking place. The merits of the protesters' cause ""doesn’t prevent them from getting the virus,” said Bradley Pollock, chairman of the Department of Public Health Sciences at the University of California, Davis. At least one protester in Tampa, Florida, is known to have COVID-19. Tampa Police Chief Brian Dugan, who expressed dismay last week about Floyd's death, tweeted Monday that five of his officers were exposed to the protester, whom he did not identify. Protesting – especially without a mask – can put people at higher risk for infection, said Dr. Michael Mina, an assistant professor of epidemiology at Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health. ""There's no doubt in my mind that these can become breeding grounds for this virus,"" he said during a Monday media availability. ""I would not be surprised to see in the next couple of weeks that we see increases that may be linked to protests."" Viral photos: A photo page of striking moments from the week’s protests. As businesses re-open, it will be difficult to figure out whether someone caught the virus at a protest or in some other encounter, Mina said. Hopefully, the fact that protests are taking place out of doors, will dilute the virus and reduce disease transmission, he said. Wearing a mask will help reduce infections, though it won't completely eliminate risk. ""If there's a floridly positive person who is coughing and spending a whole day around a lot of other people, that person might very well get other people sick despite having a mask on,"" Mina added, but ""there's a good chance that even homemade masks will actually do quite a bit to help people not get infected and not transmit."" There is historical precedent to suggest that viruses can be spread by large public gatherings. In September 1918, people in Philadelphia held a parade to celebrate the return of soldiers from World War I. The gathering of 200,000 people, crammed shoulder to shoulder, reignited a deadly flu epidemic, leading to massive closures and thousands of deaths, records show. Yet, there's a public health cost to not protesting the status quo, said Dr. Hillary Babcock, an infectious disease specialist at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, and immediate past president of the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America. ""Systemic racism also causes large public health impacts and public health risks for large portions of our population,"" Babcock said. She disagreed with calls for protesters to stay home to avoid fueling the outbreak. ""I don't think using public health as a reason to discourage protests after these events is really appropriate,"" Babcock said. ""It's a little disingenuous to say that the health risk from protesting is somehow bigger than the health risk at Lake of Ozarks (where people gathered for fun over Memorial Day weekend) or the practices that brought us to this point in the first place.""

The Providence External Review Authority said in a letter to the department leadership Monday that it wants its investigator briefed on an April incident that led to a criminal assault charge against Sgt. Joseph Hanley. Hanley, Providence police said, struck Rishod Gore several times after Gore was handcuffed. PERA Executive Director Jose F. Batista on Monday asked the police chief and public safety commissioner to schedule a time to brief PERA’s investigator, Eugene Monteiro. ""Mr. Monteiro is a native of Providence with life long relationships in both the community and police department who has enjoyed an unimpeachable career as a professional investigator in both the military and private sector,"" Batista said in his letter to the department’s leaders. ""I have the utmost confidence that he will be able to manage this review while strictly adhering to any and all applicable local, state and federal laws."" The move comes amid national protests sparked by the death of a black man, George Floyd, at the hands of police in Minneapolis. An officer, Derek Chauvin, who is white, forced his knee into the back of Floyd’s neck for almost nine minutes as Floyd lay handcuffed on the ground. Chauvin has been fired and charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. A protest in Providence on Saturday brought hundreds of people to Burnside Park and the State House, many holding signs that said, ""Black Lives Matter."" It remained peaceful and, except for some spray-painting and broken windows at the State House, free of the violence and extensive damage in other cities around the country. The call for a review of the Hanley investigation in Providence began even before Floyd’s death, Batista said. It does, however, highlight the necessity for civilian oversight of police use of force, he added. ""People are in pain,"" he said in an interview. ""I think we can go a long way to reducing violence, de-escalating violence, by simply taking a step back, applying a fresh set of eyes to this investigation."" Batista said the board has the discretion under city law to have the review. Col. Hugh T. Clements Jr., chief of the Providence police, said he’d spoken with Batista Monday. ""The Providence Police Department will cooperate with the review within the guidelines of local, state and federal law,"" Clements said. PERA is made up of eight City Council appointees and one mayoral appointee. The board was first created in 2002, but lay dormant for years before it was revamped more recently. Batista, a former public defender, was hired in early 2019 as its executive director. It’s the first time PERA has called for an independent review since being empaneled in April 2018, Batista said. Batista was careful to distinguish the situation in Providence from the situation in Minneapolis. He credited the Providence police leadership -- Public Safety Commissioner Steven M. Paré and Col. Hugh T. Clements Jr. -- with putting out a statement condemning the police’s actions in Floyd’s death. ""They get it,"" Batista said. ""They want to be helpful."" According to a description of the Hanley incident from police, officers went to Knight Street on the evening of April 19 for a report of a domestic dispute. They tried to take one man into custody, but several other people ""attempted to verbally interfere with police by shouting and engaging in other disruptive activity,"" police said. Gore, 28, of East Providence, was among those on scene as officers got the man into a cruiser, according to police. Police said they took Gore out of the passenger seat of a parked car on Tell Street and put him under arrest. The department said Hanley struck Gore multiple times after Gore had been handcuffed. The Providence Police Department and the state attorney general reviewed the incident, and concluded that Hanley should be charged with simple assault. He’s been suspended with pay pending an internal investigation. Gore was also charged with resisting arrest and disorderly conduct. Like the simple assault charge against Hanley, those are both misdemeanors. Gore’s attorney did not respond to a request for comment Monday. Efforts to reach a representative for Hanley were unsuccessful. James Vincent, the head of the Providence NAACP branch, said that he’d been in communication with police leadership about the incident. Vincent, part of the police’s community relations board, said he has been satisfied with their response so far. Vincent isn’t part of PERA, but he agrees with the call for an independent review. Hanley, Vincent said, should face the consequences -- including losing his job. Gore is black and Hanley is white, but, Vincent said: ""It’s not white versus black, it’s right versus wrong. You’re there to protect and serve, not occupy and harass. When you can kick and assault a handcuffed man, you’ve forgotten your oath. You need to be in another line of work."" bamaral@providencejournal.com (401) 277-7615 On Twitter: bamaral44",0.0

In Providence, meanwhile, a demonstration on Saturday afternoon remained peaceful, although there was vandalism at the State House later that night. Check back with providencejournal.com later today; we're talking to some of the organizers of Saturday's event about their future plans. The conversation has resonated strongly in the sports world, and last night New England Patriots teammates, and twin brothers Devin and Jason McCourty hosted a roundtable conversation about racial injustice. Today is the beginning of phase two of the state's gradual reopening. Barbershops, hair salons and gyms are among the many categories of business that can begin reopening with restrictions. Additionally, restaurants can begin indoor dining, limited to 50% of their usual capacity and with a laundry list of new rules to follow. Gail Ciampa reports that some restaurants are diving right in and others are taking it slow. Last weekend, houses of worship were allowed to resume in-person services at no more than 25% capacity. At one church in Narragansett, the priest offered Communion from behind a plexiglass shield. The number of patients in Rhode Island hospitals with coronavirus has dipped below 200 for the first time since early April. The state also reported just two new coronavirus-related deaths and 67 additional positive cases, also the lowest number since early April, and said that only about 4% of the most recent round of tests came back positive.

(WPRI) — As millions of people nationwide continue to rally for justice and reform in the wake of George Floyd’s death, one local protest over the weekend had a welcome surprise. Floyd died after former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin was captured on video pinning his neck to the ground with his knee until Floyd was unconscious. Chauvin has since been charged with murder and manslaughter. New Bedford residents Shakira Duarte, Seanna Brum and Christian Romero worked together to organize a Black Lives Matter protest in the city and the police officer who was patrolling the event ended up joining it. “We are peacefully protesting.

'Law enforcement response is not going to work unless we dominate the streets,' Barr said. The president urged governors to deploy the National Guard, which he credited with helping calm the situation Sunday night in Minneapolis and demanded that similarly tough measures be taken in cities that also experienced a spasm of violence, including New York, Philadelphia and Los Angeles.

Barr has also directed the federal Bureau of Prisons to send teams of prison riot officers to patrol the streets in Miami and Washington, D.C., said the official, who could not discuss the matter publicly and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity. The U.S. Park Police and Secret Service have had dozens of officers out in riot gear in Washington for the last few nights, in addition to the Metropolitan Police Department. U.S. Customs and Border Protection was also sending officers, agents and aircraft around the country to assist other law enforcement agencies 'confronting the lawless actions of rioters,' the agency said. The officers were being deployed in several states, though the official declined to provide specific details, citing security concerns. Several major cities have enacted curfews, and District of Columbia Mayor Muriel Bowser set a 7 p.m. curfew for Monday and Tuesday. Violent demonstrators ignored the 11 p.m. curfew the night before as they set buildings and trash cans on fire and broke into stores to steal items from the shelves.

The FBI is using its network of regional joint terrorism task forces to 'identify criminal organizers,' and federal prosecutors across the country have been instructed to share information and utilize federal riot, arson or terror statutes against any 'violent radical agitators' who attempt to hijack protests to cause destruction.

His announcement came as police under federal command forced back peaceful demonstrators with tear gas so he could walk to a nearby church and pose with a Bible. Trump's bellicose rhetoric came as the nation convulsed through another round of violence over the death of George Floyd at a time when the country is already buckling under the coronavirus outbreak and the Depression-level unemployment it has caused. The president demanded an end to the heated protests in remarks from the White House Rose Garden and vowed to use more force to achieve that aim. If governors throughout the country do not deploy the National Guard in sufficient numbers to 'dominate the streets,' Trump said the U.S. military would step in to 'quickly solve the problem for them.' 'We have the greatest country in the world,' the president declared. 'We're going to keep it safe.' A military deployment by Trump to U.S. states would mark a stunning federal intervention rarely seen in modern American history. Yet the message Trump appeared to be sending with the brazen pushback of protesters outside the White House was that he sees few limits to what he is willing to do. Some around the president likened the moment to 1968, when Richard Nixon ran as the law-and-order candidate in the aftermath of a summer of riots, capturing the White House. But despite his efforts to portray himself as a political outsider, Trump is an incumbent who risks being held responsible for the violence. Minutes before Trump began speaking, police and National Guard soldiers began aggressively forcing back hundreds of peaceful protesters who had gathered in Lafayette Park, across the street from the White House, where they were chanting against police brutality and Floyd's death in Minneapolis. As Trump spoke, tear gas canisters could be heard exploding. Floyd died last week after he was pinned to the pavement by a police officer who put his knee on the handcuffed black man's neck until he stopped breathing. His death set off protests that spread from Minneapolis across America. His brother Terrence pleaded with protesters on Monday to remain peaceful. Five months before Election Day, the president made clear that he would stake his reelection efforts on convincing voters that his strong-arm approach was warranted to quell the most intense civil unrest since the 1960s. He made little effort to address the grievances of black Americans and others outraged by Floyd's death and the scourge of police brutality, undermining what his campaign had hoped would be increased appeal to African American voters. The scene in and around the White House on Monday night appeared to be carefully orchestrated. As the crowd of protesters grew, Attorney General William Barr arrived in Lafayette Park to look over at the demonstrations and the swarm of law enforcement. The sudden shift in tactics against the protesters was initially a mystery. Then, after finishing his Rose Garden remarks, Trump emerged from the White House gates and walked through the park to St. John's Church, where an office had been set on fire the previous night. Trump, who rarely attends church, held up a Bible and gathered a group of advisers "" all white "" to pose for photos. The moment was quickly decried by Trump's critics, with New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo saying the president 'used the military to push out a peaceful protest so he could have a photo op at a church."" 'It's all just a reality TV show for this president,"" he said on Twitter. 'Shameful.' Federal law permits presidents to dispatch the military into states to suppress an insurrection or if a state is defying federal law, legal experts said. But Trump's statements also set up an immediate conflict with officials in New York and other states who asserted that the president does not have the unilateral right to send in troops against the will of local governments. The country has been beset by angry demonstrations for the past week in some of the most widespread racial unrest in the U.S. since the 1960s. Spurred largely by Floyd's death, protesters have taken to the streets to decry the killings of black people by police. Minneapolis Officer Derek Chauvin has been charged with murder, but protesters are demanding that three of his colleagues be prosecuted, too. All four were fired. While most of the demonstrations have been peaceful, others have descended into violence, leaving neighborhoods in shambles, stores ransacked, windows broken and cars burned, despite curfews around the country and the deployment of thousands of National Guard members in at least 15 states. On Monday, demonstrations erupted from Philadelphia, where hundreds of protesters spilled onto a highway in the heart of the city, to Atlanta, where police fired tear gas at demonstrators, to Nashville, where more than 60 National Guard soldiers put down their riot shields at the request of peaceful protesters who had gathered in front of Tennessee's state Capitol to honor Floyd. Two people were killed during protests in the Chicago suburb of Cicero, authorities said, but provided no details. In Louisville, Kentucky, riot police firing tear gas scattered several hundred protesters from downtown, violently capping a day of mostly peaceful protests. A vehicle plowed through a group of law enforcement officers at a demonstration in Buffalo, New York, injuring at least two. Video from the scene showed the vehicle accelerating through an intersection shortly after officers apparently tackled a protester and handcuffed him. The officers were hospitalized in stable condition, authorities said. In New York City, where nightfall has brought widespread scenes of destruction, large crowds rallied peacefully in Times Square and Brooklyn during the day. Then, in early evening, looters rushed into a Nike store in Manhattan and protesters smashed storefront windows near Rockefeller Center. Video posted on social media showed some protesters arguing with people breaking windows, urging them to stop. The city has already endured immense commercial damage from the unrest. On Monday, rioters got through the doors of the city's flagship Macy's store, famous for its Thanksgiving Day parade, and police later pulled at least two handcuffed men out of the store and put them into a van. By that time, most of the the street was littered with broken glass. In Washington, protesters continued marching peacefully through Washington hours after being forced from Lafayette park and past the 7 p.m. curfew. Eventually, within sight of the Capitol building, the marchers were turned back by law enforcement officers using tear gas, pellets and low-flying helicopters kicking up debris. As they dispersed, some protesters smashed windows at a nearby office building. Earlier Monday, Trump told the nation's governors in a video conference that they 'look like fools' for not deploying even more National Guard troops. 'Most of you are weak,' he said. He added: 'You've got to arrest people, you have to track people, you have to put them in jail for 10 years and you'll never see this stuff again.' Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, a Democrat, dismissed Trump's comments as the 'rantings of an insecure man trying to look strong after building his entire political career on racism.' Former Vice President Joe Biden, the Democratic presidential candidate, vowed to address institutional racism in his first 100 days in office. He met in person with black leaders in Delaware and also held a virtual meeting with big-city mayors. Biden said hate emerges 'when you have somebody in power who breathes oxygen into the hate.' In Minneapolis, meanwhile, Floyd's brother Terrence made an emotional plea for peace at the site where Floyd was arrested. 'Let's switch it up, y'all. Let's switch it up. Do this peacefully, please,"" Terrence Floyd said as he urged people to use their power at the ballot box. Also Monday, an autopsy commissioned for Floyd's family found that he died of asphyxiation from neck and back compression, the family's attorneys said. Authorities in many cities have blamed the violence on outside agitators, though have provided little evidence to back that up. But on Monday, federal authorities arrested a 28-year-old Illinois man saying he had posted self-recorded video on his Facebook page last week that showed him in Minneapolis handing out explosive devices and encouraging people to throw them at law enforcement officers. More than 5,600 people nationwide have been arrested over the past week for such offenses as stealing, blocking highways and breaking curfew, according to a count by The Associated Press. ___ Sullivan and Morrison reported from Minneapolis.

'We have the greatest country in the world,' the president declared. 'We're going to keep it safe.' A military deployment by Trump to U.S. states would mark a stunning federal intervention rarely seen in modern American history. Yet the message Trump appeared to be sending with the brazen pushback of protesters outside the White House was that he sees few limits to what he is willing to do. Some around the president likened the moment to 1968, when Richard Nixon ran as the law-and-order candidate in the aftermath of a summer of riots, capturing the White House. But despite his efforts to portray himself as a political outsider, Trump is an incumbent who risks being held responsible for the violence. Minutes before Trump began speaking, police and National Guard soldiers began aggressively forcing back hundreds of peaceful protesters who had gathered in Lafayette Park, across the street from the White House, where they were chanting against police brutality and Floyd's death in Minneapolis. As Trump spoke, tear gas canisters could be heard exploding. Floyd died last week after he was pinned to the pavement by a police officer who put his knee on the handcuffed black man's neck until he stopped breathing. His death set off protests that spread from Minneapolis across America. His brother Terrence pleaded with protesters on Monday to remain peaceful. Five months before Election Day, the president made clear that he would stake his reelection efforts on convincing voters that his strong-arm approach was warranted to quell the most intense civil unrest since the 1960s. He made little effort to address the grievances of black Americans and others outraged by Floyd's death and the scourge of police brutality, undermining what his campaign had hoped would be increased appeal to African American voters. The scene in and around the White House on Monday night appeared to be carefully orchestrated. As the crowd of protesters grew, Attorney General William Barr arrived in Lafayette Park to look over at the demonstrations and the swarm of law enforcement. The sudden shift in tactics against the protesters was initially a mystery. Then, after finishing his Rose Garden remarks, Trump emerged from the White House gates and walked through the park to St. John's Church, where an office had been set on fire the previous night. Trump, who rarely attends church, held up a Bible and gathered a group of advisers "" all white "" to pose for photos. The moment was quickly decried by Trump's critics, with New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo saying the president 'used the military to push out a peaceful protest so he could have a photo op at a church."" 'It's all just a reality TV show for this president,"" he said on Twitter. 'Shameful.' Federal law permits presidents to dispatch the military into states to suppress an insurrection or if a state is defying federal law, legal experts said. But Trump's statements also set up an immediate conflict with officials in New York and other states who asserted that the president does not have the unilateral right to send in troops against the will of local governments. The country has been beset by angry demonstrations for the past week in some of the most widespread racial unrest in the U.S. since the 1960s. Spurred largely by Floyd's death, protesters have taken to the streets to decry the killings of black people by police. Minneapolis Officer Derek Chauvin has been charged with murder, but protesters are demanding that three of his colleagues be prosecuted, too. All four were fired. While most of the demonstrations have been peaceful, others have descended into violence, leaving neighborhoods in shambles, stores ransacked, windows broken and cars burned, despite curfews around the country and the deployment of thousands of National Guard members in at least 15 states. On Monday, demonstrations erupted from Philadelphia, where hundreds of protesters spilled onto a highway in the heart of the city, to Atlanta, where police fired tear gas at demonstrators, to Nashville, where more than 60 National Guard soldiers put down their riot shields at the request of peaceful protesters who had gathered in front of Tennessee's state Capitol to honor Floyd. Two people were killed during protests in the Chicago suburb of Cicero, authorities said, but provided no details. In Louisville, Kentucky, riot police firing tear gas scattered several hundred protesters from downtown, violently capping a day of mostly peaceful protests. A vehicle plowed through a group of law enforcement officers at a demonstration in Buffalo, New York, injuring at least two. Video from the scene showed the vehicle accelerating through an intersection shortly after officers apparently tackled a protester and handcuffed him. The officers were hospitalized in stable condition, authorities said. In New York City, where nightfall has brought widespread scenes of destruction, large crowds rallied peacefully in Times Square and Brooklyn during the day. Then, in early evening, looters rushed into a Nike store in Manhattan and protesters smashed storefront windows near Rockefeller Center. Video posted on social media showed some protesters arguing with people breaking windows, urging them to stop. The city has already endured immense commercial damage from the unrest. On Monday, rioters got through the doors of the city's flagship Macy's store, famous for its Thanksgiving Day parade, and police later pulled at least two handcuffed men out of the store and put them into a van. By that time, most of the the street was littered with broken glass. In Washington, protesters continued marching peacefully through Washington hours after being forced from Lafayette park and past the 7 p.m. curfew. Eventually, within sight of the Capitol building, the marchers were turned back by law enforcement officers using tear gas, pellets and low-flying helicopters kicking up debris. As they dispersed, some protesters smashed windows at a nearby office building. Earlier Monday, Trump told the nation's governors in a video conference that they 'look like fools' for not deploying even more National Guard troops. 'Most of you are weak,' he said. He added: 'You've got to arrest people, you have to track people, you have to put them in jail for 10 years and you'll never see this stuff again.' Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, a Democrat, dismissed Trump's comments as the 'rantings of an insecure man trying to look strong after building his entire political career on racism.' Former Vice President Joe Biden, the Democratic presidential candidate, vowed to address institutional racism in his first 100 days in office. He met in person with black leaders in Delaware and also held a virtual meeting with big-city mayors. Biden said hate emerges 'when you have somebody in power who breathes oxygen into the hate.' In Minneapolis, meanwhile, Floyd's brother Terrence made an emotional plea for peace at the site where Floyd was arrested. 'Let's switch it up, y'all. Let's switch it up. Do this peacefully, please,"" Terrence Floyd said as he urged people to use their power at the ballot box. Also Monday, an autopsy commissioned for Floyd's family found that he died of asphyxiation from neck and back compression, the family's attorneys said. Authorities in many cities have blamed the violence on outside agitators, though have provided little evidence to back that up. But on Monday, federal authorities arrested a 28-year-old Illinois man saying he had posted self-recorded video on his Facebook page last week that showed him in Minneapolis handing out explosive devices and encouraging people to throw them at law enforcement officers. More than 5,600 people nationwide have been arrested over the past week for such offenses as stealing, blocking highways and breaking curfew, according to a count by The Associated Press. ___ Sullivan and Morrison reported from Minneapolis.

1622722692,2020-06-01 16:22:47,Barr: Law enforcement must 'dominate' streets amid protests,https://www.providencejournal.com/ZZ/news/20200601/barr-law-enforcement-must-dominate-streets-amid-protests?rssfeed=true,en,True,,68874,providencejournal.com,http://www.providencejournal.com/#spider,"WASHINGTON (AP) "" U.S. officials vowed to 'maximize federal law enforcement presence' in the nation's capital on Monday night after days of violent demonstrations led to fires across Washington and left scores of businesses with broken windows and dozens of police officers injured. In a call with governors, President Donald Trump and Attorney General William Barr also encouraged more aggressive action against those who cause violence during protests across the country following the killing of George Floyd, a handcuffed black man who died after a white Minneapolis policeman pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes even after Floyd stopped moving and pleading for air. The demonstrations have turned violent in several cities, with fires ignited in Lafayette Park across from the White House. The comments from Trump, Barr and other federal officials appeared aimed at avoiding similar scenes on Monday night, when protesters are expected to gather again. But there are also questions about whether using more aggressive law enforcement measures against demonstrators protesting police brutality would only increase tensions. Barr told the state leaders that law enforcement officials must 'have adequate force' and 'go after troublemakers.' 'Law enforcement response is not going to work unless we dominate the streets,' Barr said. The president urged governors to deploy the National Guard, which he credited with helping calm the situation Sunday night in Minneapolis and demanded that similarly tough measures be taken in cities that also experienced a spasm of violence, including New York, Philadelphia and Los Angeles. Between the protests and the response to the coronavirus pandemic, the National Guard has been deployed at its highest level in recent history, surpassing the number of troops sent to the Gulf Coast during Hurricane Katrina in 2005. More than 66,700 soldiers and airman have been activated "" 45,000 to assist with the pandemic and more than 17,000 to help with the protests. Other law enforcement resources are also being mobilized. The Justice Department deployed the U.S. Marshals Service and agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration to supplement National Guard troops in Washington on Sunday. By midnight, Barr had ordered the FBI to deploy its Hostage Rescue Team, an elite tactical unit, to the streets of the nation's capital, a senior Justice Department official said. Barr has also directed the federal Bureau of Prisons to send teams of prison riot officers to patrol the streets in Miami and Washington, D.C., said the official, who could not discuss the matter publicly and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity. The U.S. Park Police and Secret Service have had dozens of officers out in riot gear in Washington for the last few nights, in addition to the Metropolitan Police Department. U.S. Customs and Border Protection was also sending officers, agents and aircraft around the country to assist other law enforcement agencies 'confronting the lawless actions of rioters,' the agency said. The officers were being deployed in several states, though the official declined to provide specific details, citing security concerns. Several major cities have enacted curfews, and District of Columbia Mayor Muriel Bowser set a 7 p.m. curfew for Monday and Tuesday. Violent demonstrators ignored the 11 p.m. curfew the night before as they set buildings and trash cans on fire and broke into stores to steal items from the shelves. Most of the protesters have been peaceful and tried to discourage violence. Trump, Barr and others have tried to blame some of the civil unrest on left-wing extremist groups, including antifa, and other 'anarchists."" Short for anti-fascists, antifa is an umbrella term for far-left-leaning militant groups that resist neo-Nazis and white supremacists at demonstrations. The FBI is using its network of regional joint terrorism task forces to 'identify criminal organizers,' and federal prosecutors across the country have been instructed to share information and utilize federal riot, arson or terror statutes against any 'violent radical agitators' who attempt to hijack protests to cause destruction. The Justice Department has vowed to treat the 'violence instigated and carried out by antifa & other similar groups' as domestic terrorism. Although there isn't a specific federal domestic terrorism statute, prosecutors could charge other offenses and seek enhanced sentencing. The FBI has already started questioning rioters who were arrested in several cities to determine whether they committed any federal crimes, the senior Justice Department official said. It is a federal crime to cross state lines to participate in violent riots. Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy called in the entire D.C. National Guard late Sunday, adding 1,200 soldiers to join about 500 forces that had already deployed in Washington, according to two Defense Department officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. The soldiers will also be armed, the officials said, citing the potential threat from the protesters. Additional National Guard troops from nearby states were also being called in to help assist in Washington, officials said. ___ Associated Press writers Lolita C.

On Monday, demonstrations erupted from Philadelphia, where hundreds of protesters spilled onto a highway in the heart of the city, to Atlanta, where police fired tear gas at demonstrators, to Nashville, where more than 60 National Guard soldiers put down their riot shields at the request of peaceful protesters who had gathered in front of Tennessee’s state Capitol to honor Floyd. In New York, where nightfall has brought widespread scenes of destruction, large crowds rallied peacefully in Times Square and Brooklyn during the day. Then, in early evening, looters rushed into a Nike store in Manhattan and protesters smashed storefront windows near Rockefeller Center. Video posted on social media showed some protesters arguing with people breaking windows, urging them to stop. Earlier Monday, Trump told the nation’s governors in a video conference that they “look like fools” for not deploying even more National Guard troops. “Most of you are weak,” he said. He added: “You’ve got to arrest people, you have to track people, you have to put them in jail for 10 years and you’ll never see this stuff again.” Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, a Democrat, dismissed Trump’s comments as the “rantings of an insecure man trying to look strong after building his entire political career on racism.” Former Vice President Joe Biden, the Democratic presidential candidate, vowed to address institutional racism in his first 100 days in office. He met in person with black leaders in Delaware and also held a virtual meeting with big-city mayors. Biden said hate emerges “when you have somebody in power who breathes oxygen into the hate.” In Oregon, Gov. Kate Brown said she won’t send in National Guard troops to help quell violent protests in Portland because they aren’t needed. Brown said she would send in 100 state police from across Oregon to assist the city, and activate 50 Guard soldiers to work behind the scenes. “You don’t defuse violence by putting soldiers on the streets,” the Democrat said. In Minneapolis, meanwhile, Floyd’s brother Terrence made an emotional plea for peace at the site where Floyd was arrested. “Let’s switch it up, y’all. Let’s switch it up. Do this peacefully, please,” Terrence Floyd said as he urged people to stop the violence and use their power at the ballot box. Also Monday, an autopsy commissioned for Floyd’s family found that he died of asphyxiation from neck and back compression, the family’s attorneys said. The official autopsy said he died from the effects of being restrained along with underlying health problems and potential intoxicants in his system. The official autopsy found nothing “to support a diagnosis of traumatic asphyxia or strangulation.” Authorities in many cities have blamed the violence on outside agitators, though have provided little evidence to back that up. But on Monday, federal authorities arrested a 28-year-old Illinois man saying he had posted self-recorded video on his Facebook page last week that showed him in Minneapolis handing out explosive devices and encouraging people to throw them at law enforcement officers. The video also showed him attempting to light a business on fire and looting, according to an FBI affidavit. More than 5,600 people nationwide have been arrested over the past week for such offenses as stealing, blocking highways and breaking curfew, according to a count by The Associated Press. While police in places tried to ease tensions by kneeling or marching in solidarity with the demonstrators, officers around the country were accused of treating protesters with the same kind of heavy-handed tactics that contributed to the unrest in the first place. Cities struggled to keep police in line. In Fort Lauderdale, Florida, an officer was suspended for pushing a kneeling woman to the ground during a protest. In Atlanta, two officers were fired after bashing in the window of a car and using a stun gun on the occupants. In Los Angeles, a police SUV accelerated into several protesters, knocking two to the ground. In New York, the police commissioner said about six incidents were being investigated by the department’s internal affairs bureau. Sullivan and Morrison reported from Minneapolis.

Earlier in the day, thousands of protesters marched peacefully through the streets of Boston and ultimately gathered for a rally outside the State House. It was one of many protests throughout the country demanding justice for George Floyd, who died in police custody after an officer kneeled on his neck while he was handcuffed and pleading that he couldn’t breathe. The protest took a turn later in the evening and into the overnight hours, when throngs of people began vandalizing city property, including nearly two dozen police cruisers, and looting businesses. The Boston Police Department confirmed Monday that 53 people were arrested on charges ranging from breaking and entering to malicious destruction of property. Nine police officers were injured and approximately 21 cruisers were destroyed. “To the criminals and cowards that tarnished that night’s peaceful protest, I expect your day in court will come soon,” Gov. Charlie Baker said Monday. “The destruction of property, the looting, the criminal attempts to injure law enforcement are unacceptable.” The FBI said they are “committed to apprehending and charging violent instigators who are exploiting legitimate, peaceful protests and engaging in violations of federal law.” “The continued violence, potential threat to life and destruction of property across the United States interferes with the rights and safety of First Amendment-protected peaceful demonstrators, as well as all other citizens,” the statement continued. In an effort to identify and charge the FBI is accepting tips, as well as photos and videos depicting the crimes being committed online. Tips are also being accepted by phone at 1-800-CALL-FBI (800-225-5324).",0.0
1622762735,2020-06-01 19:39:49,Providence activists plan further action in response to George Floyd death,https://www.providencejournal.com/news/20200601/providence-activists-plan-further-action-in-response-to-george-floyd-death?rssfeed=true,en,False,,68874,providencejournal.com,http://www.providencejournal.com/#spider,"PROVIDENCE — While Rhode Island has a long history of civil unrest, those who attended a protest held Saturday over the killing of George Floyd, a black man who died in Minneapolis last week at the hands of a white police officer, said the demonstration was unique in its emotion and power. ""This rally ... was probably the most intense rally since we’ve been in Rhode Island,"" said Gary Dantzler, an activist with Black Lives Matter Rhode Island, which organized the demonstration. The protest, which started at noon in Burnside Park and continued into the evening at the State House, drew about 2,000 people over the course of the day, according to the state police. Few other Rhode Island protests in recent memory have had such high attendance, which is notable especially given that this one took place during a pandemic, said Steve Ahlquist, a reporter and creator of the site Uprise RI who says he’s attended nearly every protest in the state over the past seven years. The Women’s March in 2017 drew around 5,000 people to the State House. Black Lives Matter organizers said that Saturday’s action was the most important protest the group has held since 2014, when demonstrators blocked Route 95 southbound to express their anger over a grand jury’s decision not to indict the white police officer who fatally shot a black teenager, Michael Brown, in Ferguson, Missouri. Saturday’s protest reflected the sadness and frustration that has mounted over the years as police have continued to kill black people at a steady pace across the country, said Mark Fisher, an organizer with Black Lives Matter Rhode Island. ""I think what happened was this one was like a powder keg that was lit,"" he said. Although police violence against black Americans is not new, Floyd’s death and the video taken by a bystander that clearly shows a white officer kneeling on Floyd’s neck for nearly nine minutes as Floyd said repeatedly that he couldn’t breathe was a breaking point for many, said James Vincent, president of the NAACP Providence branch. The officer, Derek Chauvin, has been fired by the Minneapolis Police Department and charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. Three other officers who participated in Floyd’s arrest and stood by while Chauvin restrained Floyd were also fired but have not been charged. ""It was so heinous, so depraved and so [obviously] a murder to anybody that can see that I think it struck a nerve,"" Vincent said. Vincent said he hasn’t seen such collective unrest over racial issues since the assassination of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968. While protests in some cities have resulted in looting and violent clashes with police, Saturday’s event in Providence was peaceful. No arrests were made, according to Providence and state police. Vandals spray-painted graffiti on parts of the State House and damaged glass on some of the building’s exterior doors at around 7 p.m., according to state police, but organizers said the official protest had ended by that time. ""That was separate,"" Fisher said. ""I think it was to be expected. The youth are upset too."" Dantzler said he would have liked to have heard more appreciation from state and city officials for the way the protesters behaved. ""I led a rally where there’s thousands of people and there was no burning, no killings, no deaths, no city on fire, and I didn’t receive a phone call to say, ‘Thank you, brother Gary,’"" he said. Mayor Jorge Elorza issued a statement on Monday in support of the protesters’ message. ""Now is the time to focus both on justice for the family of George Floyd and for all of us to find safe ways to be allies with our black neighbors so that we all work towards addressing longstanding structural inequalities,"" the statement says. During her daily news briefing, Gov. Gina Raimondo said she believed that the novel coronavirus pandemic, which has disproportionately affected black Americans, may be adding fuel to the fire in many cities. ""I think the anger existed before,"" she said. ""I think it’s legitimate, and then when you overlay on top of that, people are out of work, stuck in their houses, that just adds a whole other layer."" Protesters were spread out at some points during the demonstration, but in some places, such as in Burnside Park and on the State House steps, many people were gathered in close proximity. While some public health officials have warned that large protests could lead to further spread of the virus, Joseph Wendelken, spokesman for the Rhode Island Department of Health, wrote in an email that many of the protesters in Providence wore masks and practiced social distancing. ""Our hope is that any transmission was limited or prevented for those reasons,"" he said. mlist@providencejournal.com (401) 277-7121 On Twitter: @madeleine_list",0.0
1622776460,2020-06-01 17:28:55,Fugate Departs R.I.'s Coastal Agency After 34 Years u2014  ecoRI News,https://www.ecori.org/narragansett-bay/2020/6/1/fugate-departs-coastal-agency-after-34-years-as-director,en,False,,658834,State News - United States - Rhode Island,http://www.rhodeisland.statenews.net/,"Grover Fugate said goodbye to the Coastal Resources Management Council (CRMC) last month at his final meeting as executive director of the Rhode Island agency that achieved many milestones under his three-decade watch. Fugate’s 34 years of running the coastal bureau will likely lead to opportunities to assist other states looking to emulate Rhode Island’s award-winning coastal management plans. But for now, the North Kingstown resident intends to spend more time with family and enjoy hobbies such as cabinet-making and fly fishing on the Wood River. In a May 26 farewell letter to CRMC’s governing board, Fugate, the agency’s first and so far only executive director, noted the organization’s growth and accomplishments. He highlighted the special area management plans, better known as SAMPs, the growth of aquaculture, dredging of the Providence Harbor channel, and the opening of more than a mile of public waterfront access along the Urban Coastal Greenway. In 1986, Fugate was one of two full-time CRMC employees working out of a two-story house on Davis Street in Providence, a structure that has since been demolished to make way for the Department of Administration building across from the Statehouse. He recalled an office in disarray with much of the work being done with assistance from outside agencies. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration was threatening to decertify the coastal program because of complaints about delayed paperwork. With a backlog of more than 3,000 permits, some applications took as long as five years to process. Enforcement of regulations was scant, and the agency lacked legislative authority and staff to conduct proper policing. The agency only had the power to seek criminal action, something it had yet to exercise. In-house work and legislative action led to expansion of the agency’s zoning regulation manual, called the Red Book. It was only 90 pages when Fugate took over and it was bereft of specifics on buffers and setbacks. Standards were nonexistent or sparse for barrier beaches, recreational boating, dunes, and public access. Sea-level rise and climate change weren’t even mentioned. The document is now more than 300 pages. Fugate embraced the SAMPs, eventually calling the eight planning guides the keystone to the agency’s success in developing a water-based zoning program, something that has proven difficult to achieve elsewhere. “In fact, very few governments in the world have even attempted, let alone implemented, this concept,” Fugate said. “It is the reason the Rhode Island shoreline is as beautiful as it is.” Other CRMC successes include taking over management of the dumping of dredged materials in open water. Oversight of confined aquatic disposal (CAD) cells opened the way for expanded shipping lanes and fostered major marina expansion throughout the Ocean State. In some instances, the dredging material was used for salt marsh restoration. “Dredging has been transformed through the council work from something that has been viewed as an evil thing to a valuable tool that can help with economic development as well as environmental restoration,” Fugate said. He explained how the Block Island offshore wind project was initially envisioned as a 200-300 turbine facility managed by the Rhode Island Office of Energy Resources and the University of Rhode Island. The project, he said, would have been “disastrous.” He convinced the partnership to first produce a comprehensive plan for offshore development. That plan led the way for what would become the five-turbine Deepwater Wind demonstration project. The highly regarded Ocean SAMP became the first federally approved ocean plan and it earned the Peter Benchley Ocean Award, among other accolades. “The Ocean SAMP, with its forward-looking policies and GLD (global location description), is still the most comprehensive planning and management tool in the U.S. for offshore wind,” Fugate said. The atency’s Shoreline Change (Beach SAMP) addressed climate-change adaptation a year before Hurricane Sandy struck in 2012. Fugate commended the planning guide for its online mapping tools and for being the most detailed shoreline study in the nation. Not everything is going smoothly at the agency, however. While Fugate and the regulatory and administrative team he led have mostly been immune from criticism and praised for innovative programs, enforcement is, at times, confusing, especially for habitual rule-breakers such as scrap-metal yards along the Providence waterfront. And with only two full-time enforcement officers, it’s challenging to police 400 miles of shoreline and open water up to 3 miles offshore. The all-citizen council has a history of controversial decisions, such as the approval of National Grid’s liquefaction facility, a sheet-pile wall in South Kingstown, and others that have gone against the recommendation of CRMC staff. Save The Bay prefers that CRMC’s professional staff adjudicate applications, rather than political appointees. Some appointees often seem to lack relevant experience and have poor attendance at meetings. “No matter how good a governing body is there are always bad decisions,” Fugate told ecoRI News. “But the overall good of the council has greatly outweighed anything they have messed up in the past.” When asked what needs changing at CRMC, Fugate said, “The only thing I would change about the agency is to have more staff.” CRMC currently has 30 employees. Several of the original staff are still working, such as David Reis and Lisa Turner. Willie Mosunic and David Beutel, head of aquaculture, were also early hires and retired with Fugate. Up to three other long-tenured staff are expecting to retire within the next year. Fugate holds a degree in natural resource management from the University of Connecticut. His career began as an urban forester for a private company in Connecticut. He continued as a forester for the Department of Forestry for the government of Newfoundland and Labrador. He continued work for the Canadian government while he attained a degree in public administration. Fugate’s work for Canada included planning for offshore oil development, and an environmental protection process for major onshore projects related to offshore development. Applicants are still being considered for Fugate’s replacement. Jeffrey Willis will serve as acting director until Fugate’s successor is hired. Willis currently serves as deputy director.",0.0

If you have friends or relatives who would like their own free copy of this daily briefing about Rhode Island, tell them they can sign up here . ICYMI: Rhode Island was up to 14,928 confirmed coronavirus cases on Sunday, after adding 106 new cases. The state announced seven more deaths, bringing the total to 718. There were 206 people in the hospital, 46 in intensive care, and 29 were on ventilators. Advertisement BREAKING OVERNIGHT (via the Globe’s Jeremy C. Fox and John Hilliard): A peaceful series of rallies to protest the death of George Floyd and other Black Americans at the hands of police turned sharply violent on Sunday night, as demonstrators pelted police with bottles and cans, torched a police cruiser, damaged vehicles, and looted stores throughout Downtown Crossing and the Back Bay. THANK YOU: To Ed Fitzpatrick for writing Rhode Map all of last week. He agreed to hand the keys back over to me, but I can’t help but feel a little like Wally Pipp. WELCOME TO PHASE 2 Most businesses in Rhode Island can reopen in some form beginning today, including restaurants (for indoor dining), gyms, hair salons, and child care programs. State officials were still issuing new guidance for reopening as late as Saturday, so you can expect some confusion this week. If you have questions, e-mail me at dan.mcgowan@globe.com and I’ll try my best to get you answers. For now, here are a few key things to remember. Advertisement Restaurants While outdoor dining was already allowed, restaurants can now offer indoor dining for up to 50 percent of their usual customer capacity. The rules for the size of your party are a tad confusing, so read carefully: There can be no more than eight people at one table and no more than 15 in one group. (Lap sitting is frowned upon, no matter how much you’re in love.) Establishments that might offer food such as nightclubs, movie theaters, and bowling alleys, are still not allowed to reopen. Gyms Fanny packs are typically only acceptable for dads at Disney World, but gyms are now an exception to the rule. While these businesses are expected to have plenty of cleaning products on hand, it would probably be wise to carry your own sanitizer for before and after those bicep curls. Close-contact activities are out, so you shouldn’t have to worry about those cute couples kissing near the ab machines. There are some plusses. Locker rooms and showers are closed, so those awkward conversations that merge politics and sports (“I bet Gina Raimondo and Roger Goodell are besties”) are on hold. Hair salons You should schedule your cut and color ahead of time, because salons and barbershops aren’t supposed to have people in waiting areas, and they’re not allowed to provide magazines or newspapers anymore. You should also expect to be screened at the door, and you’re required to wear a mask. This doesn’t apply to slightly balding people like me, but the state is encouraging salons to avoid using blow dryers for the time being. Advertisement Child care If you’re a working parent or you just need a little me time, daycare centers are allowed to reopen under capacity limits. That means groups aren’t supposed to have more than 10 children in them. Here’s a helpful illustration of what the state expects, complete with very modern-looking rooms, but cars from the early 1990s. Other key things to remember For domestic travel, mandatory self-quarantine rules now apply only to people coming from places that still have a stay-at-home order in place. If you’re riding in an Uber or taxi, the driver is supposed to avoid using the air conditioner. Buses are still supposed to be limited to a maximum of 20 passengers. Visits to nursing homes are still prohibited. NEED TO KNOW Rhode Map wants to hear from you.

Still, the inexorable grind of the calendar doesn’t stop for a protest march, and neither does the virus. The state is slowly reopening, but it’s premature to think the crisis is behind us. The virus is not beaten — there is still no treatment, nor a vaccine — but it seems there are limits to how long we can be bottled up, especially in a world where there is no support for people who are bottled. But reopening doesn’t mean things will be back to normal, and thousands of businesses are going to see reduced demand, be it through fewer tables at their restaurants, having to make reservations at the gyms, less foot traffic in their stores. And lots of people who are just scared to go out. That means workers with fewer hours even where they are not laid off, and businesses barely scraping by, which in turn means less money in people’s pockets, and less money spent at other businesses. Thousands of Rhode Islanders have found the last three months excruciating, so it seems a bit tough to say that there is worse ahead, but we are poised on the precipice of a very deep recession caused by a lack of demand — for goods, services, nights out to eat, whatever. This is obvious to everyone, which just makes it worse because even people with enough money to buy stuff think it might be smarter to save for the tough times ahead. While this is individually smart, it contributes to the lack of demand that slows the economy. Can we please ask a favor?

Every contribution, big or small is so valuable to us. You provide the motivation and financial support to keep doing what we do. Thank you. Become a Patron! Opens in a new tab - you won't lose you place This is exactly what the theory behind economic stimulus was invented for. Stimulus is what got us out of the Great Depression and it’s what kept the financial crisis of 2009-2010 from being much worse. I wrote about how, in Rhode Island’s 1991 demand-led recession, the state stepped in and borrowed around a third of the state budget as stimulus, and kept that crisis from being much worse than it was. Interest rates are incredibly low, so this is a good time for a similarly ambitious response. But what to do with that money? In the 1991 crisis, there was an obvious answer: give it to people who had lost it. What would be the appropriate policy response now? These days, lots of people think economic stimulus means build a bridge, but John Maynard Keynes, to whom the idea is usually credited, had more to say about the composition of stimulus than this. He’s often quoted to say that stimulus could be as simple as paying people to bury jars of banknotes and dig them up again, but in the sentence immediately following that famous passage, he wrote, “It would, indeed, be more sensible to build houses and the like.” He thought the composition of government spending was of vital concern and that only foolish leaders would overlook that. During the Great Depression, with automobiles and electricity changing our world, it made sense to build bridges and roads and generating capacity. The dams and electrical distribution towers of the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) and the Rural Electrification Agency (REA) changed the rural south and west in profound ways. The bridges and roads of the Works Progress Administration (WPA) made travel easy to a degree that had never been before. Today, though, the truth is that we have all the bridges we need. Some need maintenance, perhaps, but the point of investment is that you can do more and better stuff afterward than before. If we replace the bridge between Providence and East Providence, I’m sure it will look nicer but it won’t change anyone’s quality of life at all, except the people who were paid to build it. As Keynes said, that’s not nothing, but it overlooks the need for infrastructure that would make a difference. For example a massive investment in clean energy would change our state for the better in many ways. Perhaps this could mean developing solar canopies to blanket all the parking lots in the state. We could establish microgrids with big battery banks, everywhere and make each town energy self-sufficient. Perhaps we could address some of the vulnerabilities in the food distribution infrastructure laid bare by the virus by investing in local processing capacity. Perhaps we could beef up telecommunication capacity in the poorer parts of the state, now that we know how vital it is for helping people stay home to contain the spread of infection. There are a host of labor-intensive investments like these that are not typically thought of as infrastructure spending but that would leave the state better off as a result. Beyond stimulus, though, it’s worth thinking about how to preserve what we had before the virus forced us all apart. A business is a hard thing to start. The collection of our state’s businesses represents a tremendously valuable economic patrimony that we cannot just let wither away. These businesses have been through the wringer over the past couple of months. Many will survive, weakened, many will not. A cheap loan might help some, but others need something more. Another important component to the New Deal was the Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC), that invested in businesses as a partner, not a lender. It brought much-needed capital into businesses in exchange for part ownership, and then worked to extract itself over time. The idea was to prop the business up, but then work to keep it standing. If an owner wants to get out, such an agency could arrange a buyout by its employees, or broker the business to someone who wants to invest the time and effort to keep it going. Again, the collection of businesses in our state is perhaps the most important component of our state’s wealth. Preserving it must be high on any sensible policy agenda. One could do almost the same thing in the housing market, and exactly that was also done during the New Deal. The Home Owners’ Loan Corporation (HOLC) invested in homes to prevent foreclosure or to offer workout terms to homeowners. As with the business policies, the idea would be to extract the state as soon as feasible, but above all to keep people in their homes. (The HOLC was also responsible for institutionalizing racial discrimination in federal housing policy, but that’s a sad legacy best left in the shameful past.) Obviously renters are in need of help, too. If a landlord goes into foreclosure, tenants are not unharmed, so a suspension of rent or evictions may not be a good solution when the landlord is in debt. But the HOLC approach could be extended to landlords who are willing to accommodate rent reductions or suspensions, and help address some of the inequities in that market, too. These programs were not quick hits. They took a long time to do their work. The HOLC, founded in 1933, did not stop operation until 1954, while the RFC, founded in 1932 (it was actually created by Herbert Hoover, but it changed a lot when FDR was elected), chugged along until 1957. They spent that time quietly and patiently putting people and businesses back on their feet. And by spending the time and doing it right, neither one lost money in the end. So what about it? Here are successful models for economic intervention from our own past. We could borrow money to create a Rhode Island Recovery Fund, a corporation to emulate the past successes of the TVA, WPA, RFC, and HOLC. Borrowing is very cheap now and this could be done for low cost. But it would have to be done big to have a real effect. What this will require, though, is a smattering of boldness, for leaders who can look beyond balancing a budget to the actual needs of our society, and take a measured risk to make all our lives better and more prosperous. We know where we should be going. Will anyone lead us there?",0.0

He never thought he'd get a chance to fight back, let alone make it out alive. But on Monday, Soltan, a 32-year-old U.S. citizen now living in Virginia, used a federal statute to accuse former Egyptian prime minister Hazem el-Beblawi of crimes against humanity. The 1991 Torture Victims Protection Act allows for victims of torture and extrajudicial killings committed by foreign officials abroad to seek justice through the American court system. It's the first such case against an Egyptian official, made possible by the grim coincidence that el-Beblawi now lives just miles from Soltan, in Washington, where he is an executive director of the International Monetary Fund. 'He's completely gotten away with it, and is walking free downtown,' Soltan said. 'I just want to regain some of the justice and dignity stripped away from me.' El-Beblawi, contacted through the IMF, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In the summer of 2013, after the military-led ouster of the country's first democratically elected but divisive president, Mohamed Morsi, Egyptian security officers descended on a protest camp packed with his Islamist supporters, killing hundreds. Soltan, an Ohio State graduate and the son of a prominent member of the now-outlawed Muslim Brotherhood, was shot in the arm while working as a stringer for Western news organizations in Rabaa al-Adawiya Square. Before long he was picked up by security forces. In a mass trial widely condemned by human rights groups, Soltan was sentenced to life in prison on charges of spreading 'fake news"" to tarnish Egypt's image. In the maximum-security Tora prison complex, Soltan says he endured unspeakable torments overseen by el-Beblawi and other high-ranking officers. He says he was denied medical care for his festering bullet wound, beaten to unconsciousness, held in solitary confinement and forced to listen to the sounds of his father being tortured in a nearby cell. He lost 160 pounds over the course of a 16-month hunger strike to protest his unjust imprisonment. Under pressure from the Obama administration, Egypt released Soltan in 2015, although his father remains in prison. He has attempted to build a new life in Virginia, advocating for fellow political prisoners still in Egypt and pursuing a master's degree at Georgetown University. But memories from his dark cell in Tora still haunt him. 'There's this perpetual, compounded trauma every single day,' he said, 'where you get up and look in the mirror and see the scars and cigarette burns and the bullet marks...it changes you.' Eric Lewis, a lawyer with Lewis Baach Kaufmann Middlemiss, who represents Soltan, says he hopes the case sends a message to Egypt's government 'that they cannot commit crimes against humanity and then seek haven in the United States.' An estimated 60,000 political prisoners languish in Egypt's jails, according to Human Rights Watch, including many journalists and critics held on vague terrorism charges without trial.

(AP) "" Riot police firing tear gas scattered a protest crowd from a downtown Louisville square Monday night, hours after the firing of the city's police chief in the uproar over the early morning shooting death of a popular restaurant owner by security forces. David McAtee, the owner of a barbecue spot who was known for offering meals to police officers, died while police and National Guard soldiers were enforcing a curfew early Monday amid waves of protests over a previous police shooting in Kentucky's largest city. Police said they were responding to gunfire from a crowd. Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer announced the firing of Police Chief Steve Conrad at a news conference Monday. He said officers involved in the shooting failed to activate body cameras at the chaotic scene. Authorities had sought footage for their investigation, after Kentucky's governor demanded the release of police video. 'This type of institutional failure will not be tolerated,' Fischer said. 'Accordingly, I have relieved Steve Conrad of his duties as chief of Louisville Metro Police Department.' Gov. Andy Beshear later called the lack of body camera footage unacceptable. 'This is the entire reason that we have those cameras,' the Democratic governor said at the state Capitol in Frankfort. Beshear authorized state police to independently investigate, promising the probe will be conducted in an 'honest and transparent way that will not take months.' U.S. Attorney Russell Coleman announced that federal authorities will be part of the investigation. The governor said he had counted on body camera footage to help determine 'the truth in a way that spoke for itself, at a time when trust is difficult and people deserve to be able to see and evaluate.' Late Monday afternoon, a huge group stretching several city blocks marched peacefully from downtown Louisville to the spot where McAtee was shot. Some motorists honked horns and raised fists in solidarity. Hundreds of protesters regrouped later Monday night at downtown Jefferson Square and riot police standing shoulder to shoulder advanced amid burts of fired tear gas, dispersing the crowd. Military-style vehicles could later be seen occupying the emptied-out square. The shakeup at the top of the city's police department came a month earlier than expected. Conrad had previously announced his resignation, which was to take effect at the end of June. Deputy Chief Robert Schroeder will step in immediately as chief, Fischer said. The mayor also said the city's curfew was being extended until June 8. Police did retrieve video from crime center cameras that showed how the shooting unfolded, Schroeder said. Two Louisville officers and two Guard soldiers returned fire, he said. The two officers violated policy by not wearing or activating body cameras, Schroeder said, adding they have been placed on administrative leave. McAtee, whose YaYa's BBQ Shack is near where the shooting occurred, was mourned by hundreds. Christopher 2X, an anti-violence activist and executive director of the group Game Changers, said McAtee was well-liked. 'I've never known him to be aggressive in any kind of way,' he said.

1622828593,2020-06-01 22:25:02,Trump threatens military force against protesters nationwide,https://www.newportri.com/ZZ/news/20200601/trump-threatens-military-force-against-protesters-nationwide?rssfeed=true,en,True,,662950,Newport Daily News,http://www.newportdailynews.com/ee/newportdailynews/index.php,"WASHINGTON (AP) "" Wielding extraordinary federal authority, President Donald Trump threatened the nation's governors on Monday that he would deploy the military to states if they did not stamp out violent protests over police brutality that have roiled the nation over the past week. His announcement came as police under federal command forced back peaceful demonstrators with tear gas so he could walk to a nearby church and pose with a Bible. Trump's bellicose rhetoric came as the nation convulsed through another round of violence over the death of George Floyd at a time when the country is already buckling under the coronavirus outbreak and the Depression-level unemployment it has caused. The president demanded an end to the heated protests in remarks from the White House Rose Garden and vowed to use more force to achieve that aim. If governors throughout the country do not deploy the National Guard in sufficient numbers to 'dominate the streets,' Trump said the U.S. military would step in to 'quickly solve the problem for them.' 'We have the greatest country in the world,' the president declared. 'We're going to keep it safe.' A military deployment by Trump to U.S. states would mark a stunning federal intervention rarely seen in modern American history. Yet the message Trump appeared to be sending with the brazen pushback of protesters outside the White House was that he sees few limits to what he is willing to do. Some around the president likened the moment to 1968, when Richard Nixon ran as the law-and-order candidate in the aftermath of a summer of riots, capturing the White House. But despite his efforts to portray himself as a political outsider, Trump is an incumbent who risks being held responsible for the violence. Minutes before Trump began speaking, police and National Guard soldiers began aggressively forcing back hundreds of peaceful protesters who had gathered in Lafayette Park, across the street from the White House, where they were chanting against police brutality and Floyd's death in Minneapolis. As Trump spoke, tear gas canisters could be heard exploding. Floyd died last week after he was pinned to the pavement by a police officer who put his knee on the handcuffed black man's neck until he stopped breathing. His death set off protests that spread from Minneapolis across America. His brother Terrence pleaded with protesters on Monday to remain peaceful. Five months before Election Day, the president made clear that he would stake his reelection efforts on convincing voters that his strong-arm approach was warranted to quell the most intense civil unrest since the 1960s. He made little effort to address the grievances of black Americans and others outraged by Floyd's death and the scourge of police brutality, undermining what his campaign had hoped would be increased appeal to African American voters. The scene in and around the White House on Monday night appeared to be carefully orchestrated. As the crowd of protesters grew, Attorney General William Barr arrived in Lafayette Park to look over at the demonstrations and the swarm of law enforcement. The sudden shift in tactics against the protesters was initially a mystery. Then, after finishing his Rose Garden remarks, Trump emerged from the White House gates and walked through the park to St. John's Church, where an office had been set on fire the previous night. Trump, who rarely attends church, held up a Bible and gathered a group of advisers "" all white "" to pose for photos. The moment was quickly decried by Trump's critics, with New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo saying the president 'used the military to push out a peaceful protest so he could have a photo op at a church."" 'It's all just a reality TV show for this president,"" he said on Twitter. 'Shameful.' Federal law permits presidents to dispatch the military into states to suppress an insurrection or if a state is defying federal law, legal experts said. But Trump's statements also set up an immediate conflict with officials in New York and other states who asserted that the president does not have the unilateral right to send in troops against the will of local governments. The country has been beset by angry demonstrations for the past week in some of the most widespread racial unrest in the U.S. since the 1960s. Spurred largely by Floyd's death, protesters have taken to the streets to decry the killings of black people by police. Minneapolis Officer Derek Chauvin has been charged with murder, but protesters are demanding that three of his colleagues be prosecuted, too. All four were fired. While most of the demonstrations have been peaceful, others have descended into violence, leaving neighborhoods in shambles, stores ransacked, windows broken and cars burned, despite curfews around the country and the deployment of thousands of National Guard members in at least 15 states. On Monday, demonstrations erupted from Philadelphia, where hundreds of protesters spilled onto a highway in the heart of the city, to Atlanta, where police fired tear gas at demonstrators, to Nashville, where more than 60 National Guard soldiers put down their riot shields at the request of peaceful protesters who had gathered in front of Tennessee's state Capitol to honor Floyd. Two people were killed during protests in the Chicago suburb of Cicero, authorities said, but provided no details. In Louisville, Kentucky, riot police firing tear gas scattered several hundred protesters from downtown, violently capping a day of mostly peaceful protests. A vehicle plowed through a group of law enforcement officers at a demonstration in Buffalo, New York, injuring at least two. Video from the scene showed the vehicle accelerating through an intersection shortly after officers apparently tackled a protester and handcuffed him. The officers were hospitalized in stable condition, authorities said. In New York City, where nightfall has brought widespread scenes of destruction, large crowds rallied peacefully in Times Square and Brooklyn during the day. Then, in early evening, looters rushed into a Nike store in Manhattan and protesters smashed storefront windows near Rockefeller Center. Video posted on social media showed some protesters arguing with people breaking windows, urging them to stop. The city has already endured immense commercial damage from the unrest. On Monday, rioters got through the doors of the city's flagship Macy's store, famous for its Thanksgiving Day parade, and police later pulled at least two handcuffed men out of the store and put them into a van. By that time, most of the the street was littered with broken glass. In Washington, protesters continued marching peacefully through Washington hours after being forced from Lafayette park and past the 7 p.m. curfew. Eventually, within sight of the Capitol building, the marchers were turned back by law enforcement officers using tear gas, pellets and low-flying helicopters kicking up debris. As they dispersed, some protesters smashed windows at a nearby office building. Earlier Monday, Trump told the nation's governors in a video conference that they 'look like fools' for not deploying even more National Guard troops. 'Most of you are weak,' he said. He added: 'You've got to arrest people, you have to track people, you have to put them in jail for 10 years and you'll never see this stuff again.' Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, a Democrat, dismissed Trump's comments as the 'rantings of an insecure man trying to look strong after building his entire political career on racism.' Former Vice President Joe Biden, the Democratic presidential candidate, vowed to address institutional racism in his first 100 days in office. He met in person with black leaders in Delaware and also held a virtual meeting with big-city mayors. Biden said hate emerges 'when you have somebody in power who breathes oxygen into the hate.' In Minneapolis, meanwhile, Floyd's brother Terrence made an emotional plea for peace at the site where Floyd was arrested. 'Let's switch it up, y'all. Let's switch it up. Do this peacefully, please,"" Terrence Floyd said as he urged people to use their power at the ballot box. Also Monday, an autopsy commissioned for Floyd's family found that he died of asphyxiation from neck and back compression, the family's attorneys said. Authorities in many cities have blamed the violence on outside agitators, though have provided little evidence to back that up. But on Monday, federal authorities arrested a 28-year-old Illinois man saying he had posted self-recorded video on his Facebook page last week that showed him in Minneapolis handing out explosive devices and encouraging people to throw them at law enforcement officers. More than 5,600 people nationwide have been arrested over the past week for such offenses as stealing, blocking highways and breaking curfew, according to a count by The Associated Press. ___ Sullivan and Morrison reported from Minneapolis.

President Donald Trump had announced he would soon be addressing the nation from the White House Rose Garden, as a 7 p.m. curfew in the city loomed and a mass of law enforcement, including U.S. Secret Service agents, Park Police and National Guardsmen, stood sentry, many dressed in riot gear. Moments before 6:30 p.m., just when Trump said he would begin his address, the officers suddenly marched forward, directly confronting the protesters as many held up their hands, saying, 'Don't shoot."" Soon, law enforcement officers were aggressively forcing the protesters back, firing tear gas and deploying flash bangs into the crowd to disperse them from the park for seemingly no reason. It was a jarring scene as police in the nation's capital forcefully cleared young men and women gathered legally in a public park on a sunny evening, all of it on live television. With smoke still wafting and isolated tussles continuing in the crowd, Trump emerged in the Rose Garden for a dramatic split-screen of his own creation. 'I am your president of law and order and an ally of all peaceful protesters,"" he declared, before demanding that governors across the nation deploy the National Guard ""in sufficient numbers that we dominate the streets."" And he warned that, if they refused, he would deploy the United States military 'and quickly solve the problem for them.' As an additional show of force, Trump announced he was deploying even more of the military to Washington, D.C., giving it the feel of an armed, locked-down city after days of violent clashes, arson and looting. 'As we speak I am dispatching thousands and thousands of heavily armed soldiers,"" he said, as explosions rang out in the background. 'We are putting everybody on warning.' Then, before departing, Trump announced he wasn't done for the evening, and would be ""going to pay my respects to a very very special place.' Moments later, the White House press pool was quickly summoned for a surprise movement. And soon after, Trump strolled out of the White House gates "" something he had never done before "" and walked across the park that had just been cleared to accommodate his movements. Trump walked slowly, followed by an entourage of his most senior aides, security and reporters. The faint residue of pepper spray hung in the air, stinging eyes and prompting coughing. Sections of the park and surrounding sidewalks were strewn with garbage, including plastic water bottles and other debris. Some sections had been scrawled with graffiti. Trump crossed H Street and walked toward St. John's Church, the landmark pale yellow building where every president, including Trump, has prayed. It had been damaged Sunday night in a protest fire. Trump, standing alone in front of cameras, then raised a black-covered Bible for reporters to see. 'We have a great country,' Trump said. 'Greatest country in the world.' He didn't talk about Floyd, the church or the damage it had suffered, or the peaceful protesters police had cleared. He said nothing about the coronavirus pandemic, the parallel crisis that has continued to ravage the nation as Trump campaigns for a second presidential term. And then he invited his attorney general, national security adviser, chief of staff, press secretary and defense secretary "" all white "" to join him for another round of photos before he walked back across the park to the White House. At one point, he stopped and pumped his fist in the air at National Guard members in the distance. 'We're going to keep it nice and safe,"" he said. Rabbi Jack Moline, the president of Interfaith Alliance, slammed the fact that peaceful protesters near the White House were gassed and shot with rubber bullets so Trump could hold his photo op. 'Seeing President Trump stand in front of St. John's Episcopal Church while holding a Bible in response to calls for racial justice "" right after using military force to clear peaceful protesters out of the area "" is one of the most flagrant misuses of religion I have ever seen,"" Moline said in a statement. This only underscores the president's complete lack of compassion for Black Americans and the lethal consequences of racism.' And the Right Rev. Mariann Budde, bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Washington, to which St. John's belongs, said she was 'outraged' by the moment and noted that Trump didn't pray during his visit. 'He took the symbols sacred to our tradition and stood in front of a house of prayer in full expectation that would be a celebratory moment,' Budde told The Associated Press. 'There was nothing I could do but speak out against that.'",0.0

His announcement came as police under federal command forced back peaceful demonstrators with tear gas so he could walk to a nearby church and pose with a Bible. Trump's bellicose rhetoric came as the nation convulsed through another round of violence over the death of George Floyd at a time when the country is already buckling under the coronavirus outbreak and the Depression-level unemployment it has caused. The president demanded an end to the heated protests in remarks from the White House Rose Garden and vowed to use more force to achieve that aim. If governors throughout the country do not deploy the National Guard in sufficient numbers to 'dominate the streets,' Trump said the U.S. military would step in to 'quickly solve the problem for them.' 'We have the greatest country in the world,' the president declared. 'We're going to keep it safe.' A military deployment by Trump to U.S. states would mark a stunning federal intervention rarely seen in modern American history. Yet the message Trump appeared to be sending with the brazen pushback of protesters outside the White House was that he sees few limits to what he is willing to do. Some around the president likened the moment to 1968, when Richard Nixon ran as the law-and-order candidate in the aftermath of a summer of riots, capturing the White House. But despite his efforts to portray himself as a political outsider, Trump is an incumbent who risks being held responsible for the violence. Minutes before Trump began speaking, police and National Guard soldiers began aggressively forcing back hundreds of peaceful protesters who had gathered in Lafayette Park, across the street from the White House, where they were chanting against police brutality and Floyd's death in Minneapolis. As Trump spoke, tear gas canisters could be heard exploding. Floyd died last week after he was pinned to the pavement by a police officer who put his knee on the handcuffed black man's neck until he stopped breathing. His death set off protests that spread from Minneapolis across America. His brother Terrence pleaded with protesters on Monday to remain peaceful. Five months before Election Day, the president made clear that he would stake his reelection efforts on convincing voters that his strong-arm approach was warranted to quell the most intense civil unrest since the 1960s. He made little effort to address the grievances of black Americans and others outraged by Floyd's death and the scourge of police brutality, undermining what his campaign had hoped would be increased appeal to African American voters. The scene in and around the White House on Monday night appeared to be carefully orchestrated. As the crowd of protesters grew, Attorney General William Barr arrived in Lafayette Park to look over at the demonstrations and the swarm of law enforcement. The sudden shift in tactics against the protesters was initially a mystery. Then, after finishing his Rose Garden remarks, Trump emerged from the White House gates and walked through the park to St. John's Church, where an office had been set on fire the previous night. Trump, who rarely attends church, held up a Bible and gathered a group of advisers "" all white "" to pose for photos. The moment was quickly decried by Trump's critics, with New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo saying the president 'used the military to push out a peaceful protest so he could have a photo op at a church."" 'It's all just a reality TV show for this president,"" he said on Twitter. 'Shameful.' Federal law permits presidents to dispatch the military into states to suppress an insurrection or if a state is defying federal law, legal experts said. But Trump's statements also set up an immediate conflict with officials in New York and other states who asserted that the president does not have the unilateral right to send in troops against the will of local governments. The country has been beset by angry demonstrations for the past week in some of the most widespread racial unrest in the U.S. since the 1960s.

Soon, law enforcement officers were aggressively forcing the protesters back, firing tear gas and deploying flash bangs into the crowd to disperse them from the park for seemingly no reason. It was a jarring scene as police in the nation's capital forcefully cleared young men and women gathered legally in a public park on a sunny evening, all of it on live television. With smoke still wafting and isolated tussles continuing in the crowd, Trump emerged in the Rose Garden for a dramatic split-screen of his own creation. 'I am your president of law and order and an ally of all peaceful protesters,"" he declared, before demanding that governors across the nation deploy the National Guard ""in sufficient numbers that we dominate the streets."" And he warned that, if they refused, he would deploy the United States military 'and quickly solve the problem for them.' As an additional show of force, Trump announced he was deploying even more of the military to Washington, D.C., giving it the feel of an armed, locked-down city after days of violent clashes, arson and looting. 'As we speak I am dispatching thousands and thousands of heavily armed soldiers,"" he said, as explosions rang out in the background. 'We are putting everybody on warning.' Then, before departing, Trump announced he wasn't done for the evening, and would be ""going to pay my respects to a very very special place.'

Trump walked slowly, followed by an entourage of his most senior aides, security and reporters. The faint residue of pepper spray hung in the air, stinging eyes and prompting coughing. Sections of the park and surrounding sidewalks were strewn with garbage, including plastic water bottles and other debris. Some sections had been scrawled with graffiti. Trump crossed H Street and walked toward St. John's Church, the landmark pale yellow building where every president, including Trump, has prayed. It had been damaged Sunday night in a protest fire. Trump, standing alone in front of cameras, then raised a black-covered Bible for reporters to see. 'We have a great country,' Trump said. 'Greatest country in the world.' He didn't talk about Floyd, the church or the damage it had suffered, or the peaceful protesters police had cleared.

On Sunday night, the twins held a round-table discussion of the issues on their Double Coverage Podcast. For almost an hour and 15 minutes, the McCourtys interviewed multiple people who are actively trying to bring change. They also answered questions and discussed their own feelings on the ongoing racial problems in this country. ""Me and Dev just thought, with everything going on in the country, we’d spend some time just to talk about it,"" Jason McCourty said in the podcast. ""Sports is obviously something that plays a huge role in our loves, but right now sports doesn’t seem like something that is very important. There’s a lot of things going on in our country, from the pandemic to the racial issues that have gone on and plagued our country for hundreds and hundreds of years. We just wanted to open up our platform and be able to discuss some of these things."" This isn’t out of the ordinary for the McCourty twins. The brothers have dedicated their lives to the cause of social justice. Their work in the community led to a nomination for the 2020 Muhammad Ali Sports Humanitarian Award, which is given to athletes who have created positive impacts in their communities through sports. Last year, the McCourtys, along with teammates Matthew Slater and Duron Harmon, fought to get an education bill passed in Massachusetts. In October, the Massachusetts House of Representatives and Senate unanimously passed the Student Opportunity Act. The bill will invest $1.5 billion into the state’s public education school system. ""That’s part of it,"" Jason McCourty said. ""When you can attack legislation and get laws and the system changed, that’s going to bring a real impact. But we can’t expect that to happen over night. It’s been hundreds of years in the process of being made the way it is."" It wasn’t long ago that peaceful protests were seen in the NFL. Started by quarterback Colin Kaepernick, players knelt during the National Anthem to bring awareness to social injustice. In 2017, following disparaging comments and tweets from President Donald Trump, several Patriots players knelt during the anthem before a game against the Houston Texans. The players were booed in Gillette Stadium by people who disagreed with the action, saying they were disrespecting the military and the country. On Sunday, Devin McCourty talked about Kaepernick in light of the Floyd death, a black man who died when Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin knelt on his neck for 8 minutes and 46 seconds. ""Look at Kaepernick. A couple of years ago, people were going crazy. ‘This guy is this, he’s that,’ "" Devin McCourty said. ""Then, the irony of a man losing his life because a knee is on his neck and now, all of a sudden, people are like, oh man, let me take an extra second to listen to what Kaepernick said in an interview about why he took a knee and why he did a silent protest. ""When you listen to it, it’s like oh, that’s kind of how I feel right now after watching that video. It’s like, if you ever stopped and listened to what he was doing and his true message, it would have never got to that point and you would have never talked about the military, you would have never talked about the flag. You would’ve understood he was talking about freedom."" The brothers also talked with their former Rutgers teammate Chris Quaye, who is a private banker at Morgan Stanley. He talked about being an African American in a workplace where he is the overwhelming minority. Quaye, who is a part of his company’s diversity council, aims to help open doors for other minorities looking to get into the industry by educating youth. The McCourty twins spoke with former Rutgers linebacker Antonio Lowery, who is an African American police officer in Miami. He spoke about how he was taught that police officers were ""bad"" and ""dangerous"" while growing up. Lowery says he wants to ""change the narrative"" and he takes time to mentor kids. The brothers also spoke with Pat Brown, a former Rutgers wide receiver who is the football coach at Seabreeze High School in Daytona Beach, Florida. He spoke about trying to bring student-athletes together who come from different backgrounds because of race and family wealth. The McCourty twins also discussed how people can invest in their community to make a difference and how a simple talk with someone can go a long way. ""We have to take advantage of the platform we have while we have it,"" said Jason McCourty. ""Once you retire, you can do it but it’s almost too late to demand the audience the people that you have. It just starts with a conversation."" mdaniels@providencejournal.com On Twitter: @MarkDanielsPJ",0.0

His tactics were decried Tuesday by some fellow Republicans as well as his presumptive Democratic opponent. The violent dispersal of peaceful protests near the White House the night before was a potent symbol of Trump's policing tactics and a physical manifestation of the rhetorical culture war he has stoked since before he was elected. Moments after historic Lafayette Park was cleared, Trump walked across to pose with a Bible in front of a church damaged by fire during protests the previous evening. 'D.C. had no problems last night. Many arrests. Great job done by all. Overwhelming force. Domination,' Trump tweeted Tuesday, after a night in which heavily armed military forces and federal officers swarmed the city. Trump added: '(thank you President Trump!).' The president wanted to make the aggressive action in the nation's capital "" where he wields disproportionate powers "" an example for the rest of the country, a senior White House official said Tuesday, speaking on condition of anonymity because the official was not authorized to discuss internal thinking. Trump hoped his personal walk to the church, after federal officials dispersed protesters, would send a message about how dominant force could restore law and order. The president has threatened that if states do not take tough enough action, he will deploy active duty military across the country to quell unrest in the wake of the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. 'SILENT MAJORITY!' Trump tweeted Tuesday, embracing a phrase popularized by President Richard Nixon decades ago, in claiming broad support for his actions. Trump also emphasized the political importance of the moment to his supporters on Twitter and declared that 'My Admin has done more for the Black Community than any President since Abraham Lincoln.' The District of Columbia's federal status gives the president outsized authority to act, allowing him to direct the deployment of the National Guard. He authorized Attorney General William Barr to oversee a surge in the deployment of federal law enforcement officers, including the FBI's Hostage Rescue Team and agents from the Drug Enforcement Agency. Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Gen. Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, sought to distance themselves from Monday night's events after former military officials criticized their appearance with the president. Senior defense officials told reporters the two were not aware that the Park Police and law enforcement had made a decision to clear the square or that Trump intended to visit the church. They had been in Washington to coordinate with federal law enforcement officials but were diverted to the White House to brief Trump on military preparations, the officials said. Former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, said of Trump posing for photos holding up a Bible: 'I just wish he opened it once in a while.' And D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser said of the routing of the protesters, 'At no time do we think it was appropriate that people who had not violated the curfew or anything else received that treatment."" Democrats weren't the only ones saying Trump had gone too far. 'There is no right to riot, no right to destroy others' property, and no right to throw rocks at police,' said Nebraska Republican Sen. Ben Sasse. 'But there is a fundamental "" a constitutional "" right to protest, and I'm against clearing out a peaceful protest for a photo op that treats the Word of God as a political prop.' It was Barr who gave the order Monday afternoon for law enforcement to clear out the protest before Trump's walk to the church and ahead of Washington's 7 p.m. curfew. Officials said the decision to clear the park was made earlier in the day in response to violence the night before. Trump also ordered military aircraft to fly above Washington on Monday night as a 'show of force,' according to two Defense Department officials. They said the U.S. military and National Guard were operating under the mission name 'Operation Themis.' In Greek mythology, Themis is a titaness of divine law and order, whose symbols are the scales of justice. Execution of the order to clear the park created striking split-screen images as officers deployed tear gas, pepper spray, flash bangs and mounted units to break up the peaceful protest even as Trump was in the Rose Garden saying he supported the rights of peaceful protesters. Chemical remnants still hung in the air as he walked to the church. Trump reacted to the clearing of the protesters with enthusiasm, pumping his fist at officers in the park. He'd been furious about weekend images juxtaposing the fires in the area with the darkened White House in the background, according to current and former campaign and administration officials not authorized to speak publicly about private conversations. Trump was also angry about the news coverage revealing that he had been rushed to the White House bunker during weekend protests, believing the park fires in what amounts to his extended front yard made him appear weak. But some White House and Justice Department officials privately acknowledged that Monday's events didn't serve the administration well. Trump on Tuesday appeared to be backing off his threat to deploy federal troops to quell unrest under the 1807 Insurrection Act. White House officials said Monday night's events indicated that the resources already available to local governments should be able to restore order. Instead, Trump turned his Twitter fire on New York officials, including Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a frequent political sparring partner. 'New York was lost to the looters, thugs, Radical Left, and all others forms of Lowlife & Scum,"" Trump tweeted. ""The Governor refuses to accept my offer of a dominating National Guard. NYC was ripped to pieces.' The federal government has provided all affected states with a list of National Guard resources available to them, the White House official said. The official added that Trump's message to governors was that if they don't use all the tools in their arsenal they shouldn't expect a sympathetic response to any request for federal dollars to help with cleanup and recovery down.

'I am a mother to four black children in America, one of whom is 18 years old,' Bottoms said Friday in a rousing speech. 'When I saw the murder of George Floyd, I hurt like a mother.' Bottoms and other black female mayors, including Lori Lightfoot of Chicago, are leading some of the nation's largest cities during an unprecedented moment of challenge as protests against police brutality overlap with the coronavirus pandemic and an economic collapse. They're being praised as thoughtful leaders at a time of political tumult and high-profile examples of black women seeking and winning political office across the country. Higher Heights for America PAC, a political action committee dedicated to electing more progressive black women, said there are seven black women serving as mayors in the nation's 100 most populous U.S. cities, compared to just one in 2014.

'It's impossible for me as a black woman who has been the target of blatant racism over the course of my life not to take the killing of George Floyd personally,' Lightfoot said. 'Being black in America should not be a death sentence.' The question is whether this moment will translate into a long-lasting higher profile for the mayors. Bottoms, for example, was already believed to be under consideration as Joe Biden's running mate before the protests. Her stature has only risen amid the unrest. Beyond her well-received remarks Friday, she acted swiftly two days later, firing two police officers and placing three others on desk duty over excessive use of force during a protest arrest involving two college students. 'Use of excessive force is never acceptable,' Bottoms told reporters. Nadia Brown, a political science professor at Purdue University, said her research has found that many black female leaders, especially within their own communities, are seen as relatable figures "" something that has worked in their favor at this time.

'She was speaking in that role of telling residents what to do from an authority figure that seemed very familiar.

His tactics were decried Tuesday by some fellow Republicans as well as his presumptive Democratic opponent. The violent dispersal of peaceful protests near the White House the night before was a potent symbol of Trump's policing tactics and a physical manifestation of the rhetorical culture war he has stoked since before he was elected. Moments after historic Lafayette Park was cleared, Trump walked across to pose with a Bible in front of a church damaged by fire during protests the previous evening. 'D.C. had no problems last night. Many arrests. Great job done by all. Overwhelming force. Domination,' Trump tweeted Tuesday, after a night in which heavily armed military forces and federal officers swarmed the city. Trump added: '(thank you President Trump!).' The president wanted to make the aggressive action in the nation's capital "" where he wields disproportionate powers "" an example for the rest of the country, a senior White House official said Tuesday, speaking on condition of anonymity because the official was not authorized to discuss internal thinking. Trump hoped his personal walk to the church, after federal officials dispersed protesters, would send a message about how dominant force could restore law and order. The president has threatened that if states do not take tough enough action, he will deploy active duty military across the country to quell unrest in the wake of the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. 'SILENT MAJORITY!' Trump tweeted Tuesday, embracing a phrase popularized by President Richard Nixon decades ago, in claiming broad support for his actions. Trump also emphasized the political importance of the moment to his supporters on Twitter and declared that 'My Admin has done more for the Black Community than any President since Abraham Lincoln.' The District of Columbia's federal status gives the president outsized authority to act, allowing him to direct the deployment of the National Guard. He authorized Attorney General William Barr to oversee a surge in the deployment of federal law enforcement officers, including the FBI's Hostage Rescue Team and agents from the Drug Enforcement Agency. Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Gen. Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, sought to distance themselves from Monday night's events after former military officials criticized their appearance with the president. Senior defense officials told reporters the two were not aware that the Park Police and law enforcement had made a decision to clear the square or that Trump intended to visit the church. They had been in Washington to coordinate with federal law enforcement officials but were diverted to the White House to brief Trump on military preparations, the officials said. Former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, said of Trump posing for photos holding up a Bible: 'I just wish he opened it once in a while.' And D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser said of the routing of the protesters, 'At no time do we think it was appropriate that people who had not violated the curfew or anything else received that treatment."" Democrats weren't the only ones saying Trump had gone too far. 'There is no right to riot, no right to destroy others' property, and no right to throw rocks at police,' said Nebraska Republican Sen. Ben Sasse. 'But there is a fundamental "" a constitutional "" right to protest, and I'm against clearing out a peaceful protest for a photo op that treats the Word of God as a political prop.' It was Barr who gave the order Monday afternoon for law enforcement to clear out the protest before Trump's walk to the church and ahead of Washington's 7 p.m. curfew. Officials said the decision to clear the park was made earlier in the day in response to violence the night before. Trump also ordered military aircraft to fly above Washington on Monday night as a 'show of force,' according to two Defense Department officials. They said the U.S. military and National Guard were operating under the mission name 'Operation Themis.' In Greek mythology, Themis is a titaness of divine law and order, whose symbols are the scales of justice. Execution of the order to clear the park created striking split-screen images as officers deployed tear gas, pepper spray, flash bangs and mounted units to break up the peaceful protest even as Trump was in the Rose Garden saying he supported the rights of peaceful protesters. Chemical remnants still hung in the air as he walked to the church. Trump reacted to the clearing of the protesters with enthusiasm, pumping his fist at officers in the park. He'd been furious about weekend images juxtaposing the fires in the area with the darkened White House in the background, according to current and former campaign and administration officials not authorized to speak publicly about private conversations. Trump was also angry about the news coverage revealing that he had been rushed to the White House bunker during weekend protests, believing the park fires in what amounts to his extended front yard made him appear weak. But some White House and Justice Department officials privately acknowledged that Monday's events didn't serve the administration well. Trump on Tuesday appeared to be backing off his threat to deploy federal troops to quell unrest under the 1807 Insurrection Act. White House officials said Monday night's events indicated that the resources already available to local governments should be able to restore order. Instead, Trump turned his Twitter fire on New York officials, including Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a frequent political sparring partner. 'New York was lost to the looters, thugs, Radical Left, and all others forms of Lowlife & Scum,"" Trump tweeted. ""The Governor refuses to accept my offer of a dominating National Guard. NYC was ripped to pieces.' The federal government has provided all affected states with a list of National Guard resources available to them, the White House official said. The official added that Trump's message to governors was that if they don't use all the tools in their arsenal they shouldn't expect a sympathetic response to any request for federal dollars to help with cleanup and recovery down. Trump, meanwhile, toured a Catholic shrine on Tuesday in his second straight religious-themed appearance after he declared himself to be the 'president of law and order.""

'SILENT MAJORITY!' Trump tweeted Tuesday, embracing a phrase popularized by President Richard Nixon decades ago, in claiming broad support for his actions. Trump also emphasized the political importance of the moment to his supporters on Twitter and declared that 'My Admin has done more for the Black Community than any President since Abraham Lincoln.' The District of Columbia's federal status gives the president outsized authority to act, allowing him to direct the deployment of the National Guard. He authorized Attorney General William Barr to oversee a surge in the deployment of federal law enforcement officers, including the FBI's Hostage Rescue Team and agents from the Drug Enforcement Agency. Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Gen. Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, sought to distance themselves from Monday night's events after former military officials criticized their appearance with the president. Senior defense officials told reporters the two were not aware that the Park Police and law enforcement had made a decision to clear the square or that Trump intended to visit the church. They had been in Washington to coordinate with federal law enforcement officials but were diverted to the White House to brief Trump on military preparations, the officials said. Former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, said of Trump posing for photos holding up a Bible: 'I just wish he opened it once in a while.' And D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser said of the routing of the protesters, 'At no time do we think it was appropriate that people who had not violated the curfew or anything else received that treatment."" Democrats weren't the only ones saying Trump had gone too far. 'There is no right to riot, no right to destroy others' property, and no right to throw rocks at police,' said Nebraska Republican Sen. Ben Sasse. 'But there is a fundamental "" a constitutional "" right to protest, and I'm against clearing out a peaceful protest for a photo op that treats the Word of God as a political prop.' It was Barr who gave the order Monday afternoon for law enforcement to clear out the protest before Trump's walk to the church and ahead of Washington's 7 p.m. curfew. Officials said the decision to clear the park was made earlier in the day in response to violence the night before. Trump also ordered military aircraft to fly above Washington on Monday night as a 'show of force,' according to two Defense Department officials. They said the U.S. military and National Guard were operating under the mission name 'Operation Themis.' In Greek mythology, Themis is a titaness of divine law and order, whose symbols are the scales of justice. Execution of the order to clear the park created striking split-screen images as officers deployed tear gas, pepper spray, flash bangs and mounted units to break up the peaceful protest even as Trump was in the Rose Garden saying he supported the rights of peaceful protesters. Chemical remnants still hung in the air as he walked to the church. Trump reacted to the clearing of the protesters with enthusiasm, pumping his fist at officers in the park. He'd been furious about weekend images juxtaposing the fires in the area with the darkened White House in the background, according to current and former campaign and administration officials not authorized to speak publicly about private conversations. Trump was also angry about the news coverage revealing that he had been rushed to the White House bunker during weekend protests, believing the park fires in what amounts to his extended front yard made him appear weak. But some White House and Justice Department officials privately acknowledged that Monday's events didn't serve the administration well. Trump on Tuesday appeared to be backing off his threat to deploy federal troops to quell unrest under the 1807 Insurrection Act. White House officials said Monday night's events indicated that the resources already available to local governments should be able to restore order. Instead, Trump turned his Twitter fire on New York officials, including Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a frequent political sparring partner. 'New York was lost to the looters, thugs, Radical Left, and all others forms of Lowlife & Scum,"" Trump tweeted. ""The Governor refuses to accept my offer of a dominating National Guard. NYC was ripped to pieces.' The federal government has provided all affected states with a list of National Guard resources available to them, the White House official said. The official added that Trump's message to governors was that if they don't use all the tools in their arsenal they shouldn't expect a sympathetic response to any request for federal dollars to help with cleanup and recovery down. Trump, meanwhile, toured a Catholic shrine on Tuesday in his second straight religious-themed appearance after he declared himself to be the 'president of law and order."" Washington Archbishop Wilton D. Gregory called it 'reprehensible that any Catholic facility would allow itself to be so egregiously misused and manipulated in a fashion that violates our religious principles, which call us to defend the rights of all people even those with whom we might disagree.' On Tuesday's drive to the shrine, Trump's motorcade sped past National Guard members deployed around the World War II Memorial. Some onlookers along the route booed, held 'black lives matter' signs or made obscene gestures as the convoy rolled past. Floyd died after a white Minneapolis police officer pinned him down and pressed Floyd's neck with his knee as the man pleaded that he couldn't breathe. Violent demonstrations have raged in scores of American cities, marking a level of unrest unseen for decades. ___ Lemire reported from New York.",0.0
1622949167,2020-06-03 00:21:21,Black female mayors in spotlight amid protests and pandemic,https://www.newportri.com/ZZ/news/20200602/black-female-mayors-in-spotlight-amid-protests-and-pandemic?rssfeed=true,en,True,,662950,Newport Daily News,http://www.newportdailynews.com/ee/newportdailynews/index.php,"DETROIT (AP) "" Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms captured the nation's attention when she addressed the civil unrest occurring in her city after George Floyd's death. 'I am a mother to four black children in America, one of whom is 18 years old,' Bottoms said Friday in a rousing speech. 'When I saw the murder of George Floyd, I hurt like a mother.' Bottoms and other black female mayors, including Lori Lightfoot of Chicago, are leading some of the nation's largest cities during an unprecedented moment of challenge as protests against police brutality overlap with the coronavirus pandemic and an economic collapse. They're being praised as thoughtful leaders at a time of political tumult and high-profile examples of black women seeking and winning political office across the country. Higher Heights for America PAC, a political action committee dedicated to electing more progressive black women, said there are seven black women serving as mayors in the nation's 100 most populous U.S. cities, compared to just one in 2014. 'Black women have always been leading and we have been the defenders of our homes, our communities and our nation,' said Glynda Carr, the president and CEO of Higher Heights. 'Our leadership was built for this moment and their unique experiences as black women, not only as Americans, has provided the type of trusted leadership that can help move this country forward."" The mayors have demonstrated leadership with personal connections. Lightfoot, Chicago's first black female mayor and first openly gay leader, frankly acknowledged America's dark history of racism and blasted President Donald Trump's divisive tweets in which he called protesters 'thugs' and said 'when the looting starts, the shooting starts.' 'It's impossible for me as a black woman who has been the target of blatant racism over the course of my life not to take the killing of George Floyd personally,' Lightfoot said. 'Being black in America should not be a death sentence.' The question is whether this moment will translate into a long-lasting higher profile for the mayors. Bottoms, for example, was already believed to be under consideration as Joe Biden's running mate before the protests. Her stature has only risen amid the unrest. Beyond her well-received remarks Friday, she acted swiftly two days later, firing two police officers and placing three others on desk duty over excessive use of force during a protest arrest involving two college students. 'Use of excessive force is never acceptable,' Bottoms told reporters. Nadia Brown, a political science professor at Purdue University, said her research has found that many black female leaders, especially within their own communities, are seen as relatable figures "" something that has worked in their favor at this time. During the pandemic, residents made viral memes of Lightfoot enforcing her stay-at-home orders. Instead of chiding them, Lightfoot embraced the moment and used it to connect with residents, Brown said. 'I think that we're seeing some of this play out in real time,' Brown said. 'She was speaking in that role of telling residents what to do from an authority figure that seemed very familiar. And I think that's kind of a mode in which we're seeing some other black women elected officials deal with unrest in that they're speaking to constituents not just as an authority figure but one that is familiar."" Rochester, New York, Mayor Lovely Warren, who is in her second term as the first black female mayor of the state's third-largest city, said that while black women have made strides in gaining prominence, they still face unique challenges of racism and stereotypes. 'We're trying to fight a system that was institutionally built to create the disparities that it has created over generations and so we're trying to undo the damage that has been done to prepare our children for the future,"" Warren said. 'A lot of times we get branded with the 'angry black woman syndrome' when we're speaking up to a number of different issues that impact our community, but we have been built to take on the responsibility and we take it in stride."" 'No matter which mayor I look at across this country right now, they have done an extraordinary job trying to balance all that's coming toward them,' Warren added. Other black mayors including San Francisco's London Breed and Muriel Bowser of Washington have also been recognized for their measured responses and handling of their communities. A'shanti Gholar, president of Emerge America, an organization that recruits and trains Democratic women to run for office, said many of the black women in office today were entrenched in grassroots political work for decades, paving the way for those to come behind them. 'This is about a movement, a movement of women extending and taking their leadership all over across the country,' Gholar said. 'Black women running for office and winning, it isn't an anomaly. They're also building up the next generation of black women elected officials and black women mayors who they're inspiring to run."" Although gains have been made, Carr said there's still much more work to be done. Biden has pledged to pick a woman as a running mate and is considering several women of color. No black woman has ever served as governor in the country. Carr noted that black women make up 7.6% of the country's population yet account for just 4.3% of all members of the House and 1% of the Senate. 'All that we celebrate about the gains we made 51 years after Shirley Chisholm became the first black woman to serve in Congress, we also recognize that the 23 million black women in this country are so underrepresented and underserved,' Carr said. 'So, we need to continue to invest in recruiting, training and supporting black woman.' ___ Kat Stafford is a member of the AP's Race and Ethnicity team.

French protesters took a knee and raised their fists while firefighters struggled to extinguish multiple blazes as a largely peaceful, multiracial demonstration degenerated into scattered tensions. Police said at least 20,000 people joined the demonstration, defying a virus-related ban on protests to pay homage to Floyd and Adama Traore, a French black man who died in police custody. Electric scooters and construction barriers went up in flames, and smoke stained a sign reading 'Restaurant Open' "" on the first day French cafes were allowed to open after nearly three months of virus lockdown. Chanting 'I can't breathe,' thousands marched peacefully through Australia's largest city, while thousands more demonstrated in the Dutch capital of The Hague and hundreds rallied in Tel Aviv. Expressions of anger erupted in multiple languages on social networks, with thousands of Swedes joining an online protest and others speaking out under the banner of #BlackOutTuesday. Diplomatic ire percolated too, with the European Union's top foreign policy official saying the bloc was 'shocked and appalled' by Floyd's death. Floyd died last week after a police officer pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes even after he stopped moving and pleading for air. The death set off protests that spread across America "" and now, beyond. As demonstrations escalated worldwide, solidarity with U.S. protesters increasingly mixed with local worries. 'This happened in the United States, but it happens in France, it happens everywhere,' Paris protester Xavier Dintimille said. While he said police violence seems worse in the U.S., he added, 'all blacks live this to a degree.' Fears of the coronavirus remain close to the surface and were the reason cited for banning Tuesday's protest at the main Paris courthouse, because gatherings of more than 10 people remain forbidden. But demonstrators showed up anyway. Some said police violence worsened during virus confinement in working class suburbs with large minority populations, deepening a feeling of injustice. As the Paris demonstration wound down, police fired volley after volley of tear gas and protesters threw debris. Police were less visible than usual at the city's frequent protests. Tensions also erupted at a related protest in the southern city of Marseille. The demonstrations were held in honor of Traore, who died shortly after his arrest in 2016, and in solidarity with Americans demonstrating against Floyd's death. The Traore case has become emblematic of the fight against police brutality in France. The circumstances of the death of the 24-year-old Frenchman of Malian origin are still under investigation after four years of conflicting medical reports about what happened. The lawyer for two of the three police officers involved in the arrest, Rodolphe Bosselut, said the Floyd and Traore cases 'have strictly nothing to do with each other."" Bosselut told The Associated Press that Traore's death wasn't linked with the conditions of his arrest but other factors, including a preexisting medical condition. Traore's family says he died from asphyxiation because of police tactics "" and that his last words were 'I can't breathe.' 'I can't breathe' were also the final words of David Dungay, a 26-year-old Aboriginal man who died in a Sydney prison in 2015 while being restrained by five guards. As 3,000 people marched peacefully through Sydney, many said they had been inspired by a mixture of sympathy for African Americans and to call for change in Australia's treatment of its indigenous population, particularly involving police. The mostly Australian crowd at the authorized demonstration also included protesters from the U.S. and elsewhere. 'I'm here for my people, and for our fallen brothers and sisters around the world,' said Sydney indigenous woman Amanda Hill, 46, who attended the rally with her daughter and two nieces. 'What's happening in America shines a light on the situation here."" Even as U.S. President Donald Trump fanned anger by threatening to send in troops on American protesters, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau refrained from directly criticizing him and said the protests should force awareness of racism everywhere. 'We all watch in horror and consternation what's going on in the United States,' he said after pausing 21 seconds before answering. 'But it is a time for us as Canadians to recognize that we, too, have our challenges, that black Canadians and racialized Canadians face discrimination as a lived reality every single day. There is systemic discrimination in Canada.' More protests in various countries are planned later in the week, including a string of demonstrations in front of U.S. embassies on Saturday. The drama unfolding in the U.S. drew increasing diplomatic concern. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell's remarks in Brussels were the strongest to come out of the 27-nation bloc, saying Floyd's death was a result of an abuse of power. Borrell told reporters that 'like the people of the United States, we are shocked and appalled by the death of George Floyd.'

1623125780,2020-06-02 23:37:51,'Hate just hides': Biden vows to take on systematic racism,https://www.newportri.com/ZZ/news/20200602/hate-just-hides-biden-vows-to-take-on-systematic-racism?rssfeed=true,en,True,,662951,Newport Life,http://www.newportlifemagazine.com/,"PHILADELPHIA (AP) "" Joe Biden mounted one of his most aggressive attacks against President Donald Trump on Tuesday, deriding the commander in chief's disregard of core constitutional values and blistering him for being 'more interested in power, than in principle.' 'He thinks division helps him,' the presumptive Democratic nominee said in a speech at Philadelphia's City Hall. 'This narcissism has become more important than the nation's well-being.' Biden seized on police driving back peaceful protesters near the White House on Monday so Trump could briefly pose with a Bible before nearby St. John's Church. 'If he opened it instead of brandishing it, he could have learned something,"" Biden said as he chided authorities for using 'tear gas and flash grenades in order to stage a photo op."" Biden said Trump ""might also want to open the U.S. Constitution. If he did, he'd find the First Amendment. It protects the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.' Biden's address marked a new phase of a presidential campaign that had been effectively frozen for two-plus months by the spread of the coronavirus. The former vice president is now emerging from his Delaware home to confront Trump every day "" and using in-person appearances to offer direct competition with the president, rather than relying on virtual events that often failed to garner a lot of attention. It was the third consecutive day that Biden made a public appearance and the first time he's been out of the state since March. His remarks were carried live on the three major cable news networks. Biden delivered the remarks as upheaval in the wake of George Floyd's death has spread around the country. While Biden spoke, the National Guard maintained a visible presence to defend public buildings as Philadelphia continues to face sustained violent protests. Several buildings adjacent to City Hall, including banks, convenience stores and hotels, were boarded up. He spoke of the 'tug of war between the American ideal that we are all created equal and the harsh reality that racism has long torn us apart.' 'The honest truth is both elements are part of the American character,"" he said. Since the early days of his candidacy, Biden has framed the election as a 'battle for the soul of the nation.' He went into greater detail on Tuesday about what that meant and the questions voters should ask themselves. 'I ask every American to look at where we are now, and think anew: Is this who we are?' he said. 'Is this who we want to be? Is this what we pass on to our kids' and grandkids' lives? Fear and finger-pointing rather than hope and the pursuit of happiness? Incompetence and anxiety? Self-absorption and selfishness?' The tone was part of Biden's effort to cast himself as a 'consoler in chief"" in stark contrast to Trump's blunt, confrontational style. While he said his anguish over the death of his son Beau Biden five years ago from cancer isn't the same as the sadness felt by those protesting police brutality, he said he understood the hopelessness that can come with grief. 'Like many of you, I know what it's like to grieve,' Biden said. 'I know what it feels like when you're thinking you can't go on.' He said 'bad cops should be dealt with severely and swiftly' and offered examples of how he might ease racial tensions and govern. He called on Congress to act now on legislation that would place a federal ban on police using choke holds. Biden also promised to increase access to health care and improve the pay of first-responders and other workers who have stayed on jobs deemed essential during the pandemic, should he win the presidency. But Biden's speech was perhaps most notable for its ferocity. He accused the president of being more worried about himself than the nation at a time when it 'is crying out for leadership.' 'This president today is part of the problem and accelerates it,' Biden said, adding that Trump is 'consumed with his blinding ego.' Biden also offered a stark departure from Trump, who tweeted before Biden spoke that Washington 'had no problems last night' and cited 'many arrests,' as well as 'overwhelming force' and 'Domination' for which he thanked himself. Trump has embraced the language of confrontation and war, seeking to be a 'president of law and order,"" and betting that voters will want a more forceful approach at a time of national tumult and racial unrest. Katrina Pierson, a senior adviser to the president's reelection campaign, said Biden's speech 'obviously made the crass political calculation that unrest in America is a benefit to his candidacy.' 'President Trump is restoring the nation to order and is clearly the leader we need to return the country to peace and prosperity,' she said in a statement. Despite his more confrontational approach, Biden was direct about the limits of his ability to singularly reconcile the nation's differences. He was careful to note that his administration won't be able to fix everything, especially not all at once. 'I know that the presidency, that's a very big job,"" he said. 'Nobody will get it right every time and I won't either,"" Biden said. But he vowed not to 'traffic in fear and division."" 'I won't fan the flames of hate,' he said. ""I'll seek to heal the racial wounds that have long plagued our country, not use them for political gain.' ___ Weissert reported from Washington. ___ Catch up on the 2020 election campaign with AP experts on our weekly politics podcast, 'Ground Game.'",0.0

French protesters took a knee and raised their fists while firefighters struggled to extinguish multiple blazes as a largely peaceful, multiracial demonstration degenerated into scattered tensions. Police said at least 20,000 people joined the demonstration, defying a virus-related ban on protests to pay homage to Floyd and Adama Traore, a French black man who died in police custody. Electric scooters and construction barriers went up in flames, and smoke stained a sign reading 'Restaurant Open' "" on the first day French cafes were allowed to open after nearly three months of virus lockdown. Chanting 'I can't breathe,' thousands marched peacefully through Australia's largest city, while thousands more demonstrated in the Dutch capital of The Hague and hundreds rallied in Tel Aviv. Expressions of anger erupted in multiple languages on social networks, with thousands of Swedes joining an online protest and others speaking out under the banner of #BlackOutTuesday. Diplomatic ire percolated too, with the European Union's top foreign policy official saying the bloc was 'shocked and appalled' by Floyd's death. Floyd died last week after a police officer pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes even after he stopped moving and pleading for air. The death set off protests that spread across America "" and now, beyond. As demonstrations escalated worldwide, solidarity with U.S. protesters increasingly mixed with local worries. 'This happened in the United States, but it happens in France, it happens everywhere,' Paris protester Xavier Dintimille said. While he said police violence seems worse in the U.S., he added, 'all blacks live this to a degree.' Fears of the coronavirus remain close to the surface and were the reason cited for banning Tuesday's protest at the main Paris courthouse, because gatherings of more than 10 people remain forbidden. But demonstrators showed up anyway. Some said police violence worsened during virus confinement in working class suburbs with large minority populations, deepening a feeling of injustice. As the Paris demonstration wound down, police fired volley after volley of tear gas and protesters threw debris. Police were less visible than usual at the city's frequent protests. Tensions also erupted at a related protest in the southern city of Marseille. The demonstrations were held in honor of Traore, who died shortly after his arrest in 2016, and in solidarity with Americans demonstrating against Floyd's death. The Traore case has become emblematic of the fight against police brutality in France. The circumstances of the death of the 24-year-old Frenchman of Malian origin are still under investigation after four years of conflicting medical reports about what happened. The lawyer for two of the three police officers involved in the arrest, Rodolphe Bosselut, said the Floyd and Traore cases 'have strictly nothing to do with each other."" Bosselut told The Associated Press that Traore's death wasn't linked with the conditions of his arrest but other factors, including a preexisting medical condition. Traore's family says he died from asphyxiation because of police tactics "" and that his last words were 'I can't breathe.' 'I can't breathe' were also the final words of David Dungay, a 26-year-old Aboriginal man who died in a Sydney prison in 2015 while being restrained by five guards. As 3,000 people marched peacefully through Sydney, many said they had been inspired by a mixture of sympathy for African Americans and to call for change in Australia's treatment of its indigenous population, particularly involving police. The mostly Australian crowd at the authorized demonstration also included protesters from the U.S. and elsewhere. 'I'm here for my people, and for our fallen brothers and sisters around the world,' said Sydney indigenous woman Amanda Hill, 46, who attended the rally with her daughter and two nieces. 'What's happening in America shines a light on the situation here."" Even as U.S. President Donald Trump fanned anger by threatening to send in troops on American protesters, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau refrained from directly criticizing him and said the protests should force awareness of racism everywhere. 'We all watch in horror and consternation what's going on in the United States,' he said after pausing 21 seconds before answering. 'But it is a time for us as Canadians to recognize that we, too, have our challenges, that black Canadians and racialized Canadians face discrimination as a lived reality every single day. There is systemic discrimination in Canada.' More protests in various countries are planned later in the week, including a string of demonstrations in front of U.S. embassies on Saturday. The drama unfolding in the U.S. drew increasing diplomatic concern. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell's remarks in Brussels were the strongest to come out of the 27-nation bloc, saying Floyd's death was a result of an abuse of power. Borrell told reporters that 'like the people of the United States, we are shocked and appalled by the death of George Floyd.'

On Sunday night, the twins and members of the Patriots secondary held a round table discussion on their Double Coverage Podcast. For almost an hour and 15 minutes, the McCourty’s interviewed multiple people who are actively trying to bring change. They also answered questions and discussed their own personal feelings on the ongoing racial problems in this country. ""Me and Dev just thought with everything going on in the country, we’d spend some time just to talk about it,"" Jason McCourty said in the podcast. ""Sports is obviously something that plays a huge role in our loves, but right now sports doesn’t seem like something that is very important. There’s a lot of things going on in our country from the pandemic to the racial issues that have gone on and plagued our country for hundreds and hundreds of years. We just wanted to open up our platform and be able to discuss some of these things."" This isn’t out of the ordinary for the McCourty twins. The brothers have dedicated their life to social justice causes. Their work in the community led to a nomination for the 2020 Muhammad Ali Sports Humanitarian Award, which is given to athletes who have created positive impacts in their communities. Last year, the McCourty’s along with Matthew Slater and Duron Harmon, fought to get an education bill passed in Massachusetts. In October, the Massachusetts House of Representatives and Senate unanimously passed the Student Opportunity Act. The bill will invest $1.5 billion into the states public education school system. ""That’s part of it,"" Jason McCourty said. ""When you can attack legislation and get laws and the system changed, that’s going to bring a real impact. But we can’t expect that to happen over night. It’s been hundreds of years in the process of being made the way it is."" It wasn’t long ago that peaceful protests broke out in the NFL. Started by former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick, players started to kneel during the National Anthem to bring awareness to social injustice. In 2017, following disparaging comments and tweets from President Donald Trump, Patriots players even knelt during the anthem before a game against the Houston Texans. The players were booed in Gillette Stadium for their action while people who disagreed with the action said they were disrespecting the military and country. On Sunday, Devin McCourty said it was sadly ironic that people disparaged Kaepernick while years later a black man was killed when Minneapolis, Minn., police officer Derek Chauvin knelt on his neck for 8 minutes and 46 seconds. ""Look at Kaepernick. A couple years ago, people were going crazy. ‘This guy is this, he’s that,’"" Devin McCourty said. ""Then, the irony of a man losing his life because a knee is in his neck and now, all of a sudden, people are like, oh man, let me take an extra second to listen to what Kaepernick said in an interview about why he took a knee and why he did a silent protest. ""When you listen to it, it’s like oh, that’s kind of how I feel right now after watching that video. It’s like, if you ever stopped and listen to what he was doing and his true message, it would have never got to that point and you would have never talked about the military, you would have never talked about the flag. You would’ve understood he was talking about freedom."" On the podcast, the brothers also talked with their former Rutgers teammate Chris Quaye, who is a private banker at Morgan Stanley. He talked about being an African American in a workplace where he is the overwhelming minority. Quaye, who is a part of his company’s diversity council, aims to help open doors for other minorities looking to get into the industry by educating youth. The McCourty twins spoke with former Rutgers linebacker Antonio Lowery, who is an African American police officer in Miami. He spoke about how he was taught that police offers were ‘bad’ and ‘dangerous’ while growing up. Lowery says he wants to ""change the narrative"" and he takes time to mentor kids. The brothers then spoke with Pat Brown, a former Rutgers wide receiver, who is the football coach at Seabreeze High School in Daytona Beach, Florida. He spoke about trying to bring student athletes together who come from different backgrounds in regards to race and family wealth. The McCourty twins also discussed about how people can invest in their community to make a difference and how a simple talk with someone can go a long way. ""We have to take advantage of the platform we have while we have it,"" said Jason McCourty. ""Once you retire you can do it, but it’s almost too late to demand the audience the people that you have. It just starts with a conversation."" mdaniels@providencejournal.com On Twitter: @MarkDanielsPJ",0.0

Providence Public Safety Commissioner Steven Pare told Eyewitness News that several police officers and troopers were injured and treated on scene after bricks were thrown at them. “There were a couple of police officers who were injured and a couple of troopers as well, by either bricks or objects thrown at them,” Pare said. “They are fine; the extent of their injuries, we are not quite sure at this point.” Pare said he spoke to some community leaders at 1 a.m. trying to calm things. He noted the peaceful protest on Saturday that went well, but said the scene overnight was planned. “We were alerted [before the incident occurred] that something may have happened last night, so we geared up as much as we could getting Providence Police officers, and State Police officers in the city, and unfortunately around 11-11:30 there were 200 to 300 mostly young males that went and breached the Providence Place Mall, started looting the mall and causing damage inside.” Pare said that about 100 people went inside the mall. Officers were able to regain control inside and outside at Francis Street and Finance Way, halting the damage and chaos for a couple of hours, he said, but people were still able to surround the police car outside 1 American Express Plaza and set it on fire. “We were with State, Providence, and nearly 100-150 police officers and we appreciate the mutual aid that was sent from Cranston, Woonsocket, North Providence and Johnston, and I am going to forget a department but they sent police officers here and we needed all that help,” he continued.

I get there is anger, I am angry, but this is not the solution,” Pare said. “I engaged with them, I tried to rationalize with them that before someone gets hurt we understand your pain and we feel your pain to the extent that we can, but this is not the solution.” Clements was asked about how the black men and women officers in the city are dealing with the situation. “Many of them grew up in Providence, they went to schools in the city of Providence, I’m sure they’re feeling a lot of pain right now — we haven’t had an opportunity to brief on this incident.

I get there is anger, I am angry, but this is not the solution,” Pare said. “I engaged with them, I tried to rationalize with them that before someone gets hurt we understand your pain and we feel your pain to the extent that we can, but this is not the solution.” Clements was asked about how the black men and women officers in the city are dealing with the situation. “Many of them grew up in Providence, they went to schools in the city of Providence, I’m sure they’re feeling a lot of pain right now — we haven’t had an opportunity to brief on this incident. But this was senseless,” Clements responded. “This wasn’t a protest, this was all senseless violence in the city that does not help at all.”",0.0

'I want everybody to know that this is what those officers took. At the end of the day, they get to go home and be with their families,' Roxie Washington said during a Minneapolis news conference with her young daughter at her side. 'I'm here for my baby and I'm here for George because I want justice for him. I want justice for him because he was good. No matter what anybody thinks, he was good.' Floyd died on Memorial Day after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee into the black man's neck for several minutes even after he stopped moving and pleading for air. ___ SEATTLE "" Seattle's police watchdog agency said Tuesday it is investigating the use of pepper spray to break up a fourth consecutive day of large protests over the George Floyd killing, a tactic that drew questions from some city leaders. The protest Monday was largely peaceful but turned chaotic as officers dispersed the crowd at night using tear gas and flash-bang devices. Authorities said demonstrators threw fireworks and tried to storm a barricade near a police station, but citizen video posted on Reddit and Facebook showed that the chaos began when an officer grabbed a pink umbrella that a demonstrator was holding just across a barricade. Other officers nearby then began spraying chemicals and firing flash-bangs. Seattle's Office of Police Accountability said it has received about 12,000 complaints over the Seattle Police Department's handling of the demonstrations and looting. ___ WASHINGTON "" Thousands of protesters are massing across the street from Lafayette Park near the White House on Tuesday, as military and civilian law enforcement personnel stood on the other side of a black chain link fence that had been put up overnight to block access to the park. The crowd chanted the name of George Floyd and Black Lives Matter. Floyd is the black man who died while in police custody in Minnesota. The protesters stood in front of the historic church where President Donald Trump went for a photo op Monday night after the area around Lafayette Park was cleared of protesters by law enforcement officials using smoke canisters and pepper balls. A half dozen Episcopal priests stood outside St. John's Church handing out bottled water and praying with protesters. ___ WASHINGTON "" A former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff says he was 'sickened' to see National Guard troops and other security personnel forcibly clear protesters from a square near the White House to facilitate President Donald Trump's walk to a nearby church to pose for photographers. Calling the visit Monday a 'stunt,' Mike Mullen, a retired Navy admiral who headed the military from 2007 to 2011, wrote in The Atlantic on Tuesday it laid bare what he called Trump's 'disdain' for the rights of peaceful protesters. He said it also risked further politicizing the military. Mullen cautioned against an overly aggressive use of the military to restrain the sometimes-violent protests around the country. He said he has confidence in the professionalism of the troops but worries about the soundness of the orders they would be given by Trump, who has threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act to enable him to use the active duty military to perform law enforcement duties to quell protests. Mullen said that as bad as conditions on the streets of some cities have become, the crisis does not now justify invoking the Insurrection Act. ___ MIAMI "" A demonstration in Miami grew to about 400 people as protesters marched from a courthouse to a historically black neighborhood north of downtown. Demonstrators sat on one knee during several stops to listen to organizers shouting instructions that they were to remain peaceful and hydrated in the 80-degree weather. They shouted 'No justice, no peace, no racist police' as more than 30 officers followed the group a few blocks behind wearing body armor. Twenty-two-year-old Trinity Auberry arrived at the demonstration with four other friends. It was the first time protesting for the young black model who said the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis is not isolated and cases of 'police brutality' are also common in Florida. 'It happens everywhere,' Auberry said. 'I just pray for the hearts of the wicked to be changed. If their hearts don't change, it's the same cycle over and over again.' ___ CHARLESTON, W.Va. "" The West Virginia National Guard is pursuing disciplinary action against a guardsman who posted on social media that he would shoot at people protesting the death of George Floyd, officials said Tuesday. The guardsman, Noah Garcelon, has already resigned his position as an officer with the Winfield Police Department after making the comments. In a series of now-deleted posts, Garcelon wrote that he would 'start firing live rounds' at protesters and 'see how many I can run over before my car breaks down.' Maj. Gen. James Hoyer, who leads the state's National Guard, said officials will be taking the appropriate disciplinary action related to Garcelon and any others 'who make inflammatory comments related to protests going on across the nation.' Winfield Police Department Chief Ron Arthur said Garcelon acknowledged that he made the comments and stressed that he wasn't a racist before resigning. West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice, a Republican, has urged people to remain peaceful but said he would not hesitate to call in the National Guard if demonstrations in the state became violent. ___ COLUMBIA, S.C. "" About 100 people gathered in front of the state capitol building in downtown Columbia, South Carolina, on Tuesday afternoon as medics passed out water bottles and snacks and volunteers passed out voter registration forms. Participants raised their fists in unison as passing commuters showed their solidarity with honks and waves. An outreach minister emphasized the need to sustain demonstrations past the initial events over the weekend and also urged a peaceful nature in the afternoon's demonstrations. Minister Danielle Ford told the crowd, 'they're waiting on us to give up, they're waiting on us to get tired, they're waiting on us to give in. We need you out here.' A 21-year-old college student said she was protesting for justice for George Floyd as well as Joshua Ruffin, a 17-year-old shot to death by a Columbia police officer after a foot chase in April. ___ HOUSTON -- Houston rappers Bun B and Trae Tha Truth organized a march on Tuesday and told the crowd it would be peaceful. After asking the crowd of several thousand to look for anybody who could cause trouble, Bun B then led them on a chant. He said 'What's his name?' and the crowd replied, 'George Floyd.' The crowd later got down on one knee and was silent for 30 seconds. Among those participating was a group of about 60 people on horseback from a riding club in Houston. ___ LOS ANGELES -- Los Angeles Police Chief Michel Moore said Tuesday more than 2,700 people have been arrested since protests and violence began in the nation's second-largest city. The chief told the city Police Commission that about 2,500 of those arrests were for failure to disperse or curfew violations. The remainder were for crimes including burglary, looting, assaults on police officers and other violence. The chief gave the figures during a report to the Police Department's civilian oversight board. Several new demonstrations in Los Angeles on Tuesday over the death of George Floyd have remained peaceful. ___ PARIS "" Riot officers have fired tear gas as scattered protesters threw projectiles and set fires during an unauthorized demonstration against police violence and racial injustice. Several thousand people had previously rallied peacefully for two hours Tuesday around the main Paris courthouse in homage to George Floyd and to Adama Traore, a French black man who died in police custody. Police had banned the protest because of coronavirus restrictions that forbid any gathering of more than 10 people. As the demonstration wound down, police fired tear gas and protesters could be seen throwing projectiles. Two small fires broke out. Tensions also erupted at a related protest Tuesday in the southern city of Marseille. ___ CHICAGO -- Authorities in a Chicago suburb where two people were fatally shot in unrest following George Floyd's death are issuing fresh safety precautions Tuesday. Cicero officials cautioned residents to 'stay home and stay off the streets' a day after violence and destruction erupted in the town of about 84,000 west of Chicago. Police say most of Monday's chaos stemmed from residents trying to defend businesses. Roughly 60 people were arrested, mostly for burglary and weapons violations. Two men in their 20s were fatally shot around 6 p.m. in separate incidents related to the violent clashes. ___ TRENTON, N.J. "" Citing George Floyd's death, New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir Grewal said Tuesday the state will update its guidelines governing the use of force by police for the first time in two decades and will move to require a statewide licensing program for all officers. At least 43 other states require some licensing requirement for officers, Grewal said, adding he wants to bring law enforcement in line with other professions that require licensing. The announcements also include a pilot program in a handful of cities across the state to conduct training programs aimed at promoting safe interactions between police and communities and the implementation of a statewide database to document when police use force, Grewal said. ___ MINNEAPOLIS "" The state of Minnesota has filed a civil rights charge against the Minneapolis Police Department in the wake of George Floyd's death. The state says it will investigate the department's policies and practices over the last 10 years to determine whether it has engaged in 'systemic' discrimination against people of color. The complaint comes from the state Department of Human Rights, which enforces the state's human rights act. It targets a police department that has faced decades of allegations of brutality and other discrimination against African-Americans and other minorities including within the department itself. Critics say the department has a culture that resists change and the department has come under fresh criticism after Floyd died after a white officer knelt on his neck and ignored his cries of 'I can't breathe' until Floyd eventually stopped moving. ___ WASHINGTON "" Attorney General William Barr ordered law enforcement officials to clear Lafayette Park and push back the perimeter around the White House when he arrived there Monday evening, leading to police using tear gas to disperse protesters. A person familiar with the matter tells The Associated Press that Barr expected the perimeter to have been extended much earlier Monday. The person could not discuss the matter publicly and spoke to AP on condition of anonymity. The person said officials had met that morning and decided the perimeter had to be moved by at least one full block after multiple fires were set in the park the night before. They said that was expected to happen by Monday afternoon. The person said Barr was surprised it hadn't been done when he arrived in the early evening and directed action to be taken. They said he assumed police would use 'typical crowd control measures' against protesters who resisted commands to clear the area. ___ MINNEAPOLIS "" Prosecutors are delaying the case against a man who drove his semitrailer into a crowd of protesters on a closed Minneapolis freeway. The 35-year-old man drove his tanker truck into the midst of thousands of people who had gathered on Interstate 35W near downtown Minneapolis on Sunday. Authorities said it appeared no one was hurt and the man was arrested. Gov. Tim Walz said the man became confused and somehow got on the freeway before traffic officials closed it. Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman announced Tuesday that the case against the man has been deferred pending further investigation and he'll be released from jail. Freeman said investigators are working to gather additional information to help in making a charging decision. ___ WASHINGTON "" President Donald Trump ordered military aircraft to fly above the nation's capital Monday night as a 'show of force' against demonstrators protesting the death of George Floyd, according to two Department of Defense officials. Show-of-force missions are designed to intimidate and, in combat zones, warn opposing forces of potential military action if provoked. The officials, who insisted on anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss ongoing operations publicly, did not say how many or what type of aircraft had been mobilized. Videos and photographs posted on social media showed helicopters flying low over buildings and hovering just above groups who were on the street despite a district-wide curfew. On Tuesday, roughly 700 members of the Army's 82nd Airborne Division had arrived at two military bases near Washington. Another 1,400 soldiers are ready to be mobilized within an hour, the two Pentagon officials said. The soldiers are armed and have riot gear as well as bayonets. The officials said the mission has been named 'Operation Themis.' In Greek mythology, Themis was a titaness of divine law and order, whose symbols are the scales of justice. -- Reporting by James LaPorta",0.0

The protest, like many around the country, was calling for justice for George Floyd, a Minnesota man killed in police custody. More than 60 people were arrested and as many as 10 police officers were injured when they were hit by rocks or bricks, authorities said. The protesters reportedly broke into the mall after clashes with the police, looting stores. After they were dispersed, some protesters were reported to have looted and vandalized areas throughout the city. It was not immediately clear how many of the protesters took part in looting or clashes with the police. - Advertisement - A police cruiser was also burned in the confrontation. “This was a mob,” state police Col. James Manni said. “These were not protesters. This was an intentional, coordinated attack on the city.” Police received intelligence several hours prior to the violence that people were coming from out of state armed with crow bars, flares and gasoline, Manni said. Providence Mayor Jorge Elorza on Tuesday morning said five of the people arrested were from out of state. Providence Public Safety Commissioner Steven M. Paré said Tuesday that none of the hurt officers was seriously injured. “We are at a critical moment in American history, and our actions today can set the course for a more just and equal society tomorrow,” said Gov. Gina M. Raimondo in a statement on Tuesday. “But if we let violence give rise to more violence, then that opportunity will be lost. What happened in Providence last night was unacceptable. It was criminal. It put lives at risk. And those responsible will be held accountable.” “To those in Rhode Island and around the country who are expressing your outrage and pain through peaceful protest: I hear you,” Raimondo said. “Let’s rise above the hate, rise above the fear, and work to root out racism on an individual and institutional level.” In a statement Monday, Providence Mayor Jorge O. Elorza addressed the protest. “Last night’s incidents were devastating for our community who has already experienced so much unrest and pain. Violence is never the answer and we need collective action— one that is productive, not destruction of our small businesses, who have been impacted so much already and by putting others safety at risk,” Elorza said. “Now is the time to focus on finding safe ways to be allies with our Black neighbors and to come together to support our business community as they rebuild and we all recover,” he added.

Authorities said demonstrators threw fireworks and tried to storm a barricade near a police station, but citizen video posted on Reddit and Facebook showed that the chaos began when an officer grabbed a pink umbrella that a demonstrator was holding just across a barricade.

'He thinks division helps him,' the presumptive Democratic nominee said in a speech at Philadelphia's City Hall. 'This narcissism has become more important than the nation's well-being.' Biden seized on police driving back peaceful protesters near the White House on Monday so Trump could briefly pose with a Bible before nearby St. John's Church. 'If he opened it instead of brandishing it, he could have learned something,"" Biden said as he chided authorities for using 'tear gas and flash grenades in order to stage a photo op."" Biden said Trump ""might also want to open the U.S. Constitution. If he did, he'd find the First Amendment. It protects the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.' Biden's address marked a new phase of a presidential campaign that had been effectively frozen for two-plus months by the spread of the coronavirus. The former vice president is now emerging from his Delaware home to confront Trump every day "" and using in-person appearances to offer direct competition with the president, rather than relying on virtual events that often failed to garner a lot of attention. It was the third consecutive day that Biden made a public appearance and the first time he's been out of the state since March. His remarks were carried live on the three major cable news networks. Biden delivered the remarks as upheaval in the wake of George Floyd's death has spread around the country. While Biden spoke, the National Guard maintained a visible presence to defend public buildings as Philadelphia continues to face sustained violent protests. Several buildings adjacent to City Hall, including banks, convenience stores and hotels, were boarded up. He spoke of the 'tug of war between the American ideal that we are all created equal and the harsh reality that racism has long torn us apart.' 'The honest truth is both elements are part of the American character,"" he said. Since the early days of his candidacy, Biden has framed the election as a 'battle for the soul of the nation.' He went into greater detail on Tuesday about what that meant and the questions voters should ask themselves. 'I ask every American to look at where we are now, and think anew: Is this who we are?' he said. 'Is this who we want to be? Is this what we pass on to our kids' and grandkids' lives? Fear and finger-pointing rather than hope and the pursuit of happiness? Incompetence and anxiety? Self-absorption and selfishness?' The tone was part of Biden's effort to cast himself as a 'consoler in chief"" in stark contrast to Trump's blunt, confrontational style. While he said his anguish over the death of his son Beau Biden five years ago from cancer isn't the same as the sadness felt by those protesting police brutality, he said he understood the hopelessness that can come with grief. 'Like many of you, I know what it's like to grieve,' Biden said. 'I know what it feels like when you're thinking you can't go on.' He said 'bad cops should be dealt with severely and swiftly' and offered examples of how he might ease racial tensions and govern. He called on Congress to act now on legislation that would place a federal ban on police using choke holds. Biden also promised to increase access to health care and improve the pay of first-responders and other workers who have stayed on jobs deemed essential during the pandemic, should he win the presidency. But Biden's speech was perhaps most notable for its ferocity. He accused the president of being more worried about himself than the nation at a time when it 'is crying out for leadership.' 'This president today is part of the problem and accelerates it,' Biden said, adding that Trump is 'consumed with his blinding ego.' Biden also offered a stark departure from Trump, who tweeted before Biden spoke that Washington 'had no problems last night' and cited 'many arrests,' as well as 'overwhelming force' and 'Domination' for which he thanked himself. Trump has embraced the language of confrontation and war, seeking to be a 'president of law and order,"" and betting that voters will want a more forceful approach at a time of national tumult and racial unrest. Katrina Pierson, a senior adviser to the president's reelection campaign, said Biden's speech 'obviously made the crass political calculation that unrest in America is a benefit to his candidacy.' 'President Trump is restoring the nation to order and is clearly the leader we need to return the country to peace and prosperity,' she said in a statement. Despite his more confrontational approach, Biden was direct about the limits of his ability to singularly reconcile the nation's differences. He was careful to note that his administration won't be able to fix everything, especially not all at once. 'I know that the presidency, that's a very big job,"" he said. 'Nobody will get it right every time and I won't either,"" Biden said. But he vowed not to 'traffic in fear and division."" 'I won't fan the flames of hate,' he said. ""I'll seek to heal the racial wounds that have long plagued our country, not use them for political gain.' ___ Weissert reported from Washington. ___ Catch up on the 2020 election campaign with AP experts on our weekly politics podcast, 'Ground Game.'",0.0

Pelosi invoked Biblical scripture to reject Trump's clampdown on peaceful protesters outside the White House and she drew on past presidents "" including George H.W. Bush in the aftermath of the Rodney King unrest and Barack Obama following the death of Eric Garner "" as models of the nation's chief executive at a time of crisis. 'We would hope that the president of the United States would follow the lead of so many presidents before him to be a healer in chief and not a fanner of the flame,' Pelosi said. As pleas for reconciliation over the country's long struggle with racial inequality were met with demands for accountability over George Floyd's death at the hands of police in Minneapolis, there was a shifting tone coming from Congress. Gone are the days when 'Black Lives Matter' protests were met simply with 'Blue Lives Matter' retorts in support of law enforcement. Instead, Congress seems to have heard the protesters outside its doors. 'You can understand the outrage,' McConnell, the Republican Senate leader, said. McConnell said it's not only the death of Floyd at the hands of white police in Minnesota drawing protesters into the streets, but of other African Americans including Breonna Taylor in his home-state of Kentucky. 'There is no question that there is residual racism in America,' McConnell told reporters. 'It's been a longtime dilemma and we all wish we could get to a better place.' As the world watches a nation in turmoil, Democrats and some Republicans are swiftly preparing inquiries into the president's actions against the protesters and a legislative response to the police violence and racial inequality at the heart of marches erupting in communities nationwide. Trump was widely criticized for clearing protesters late Monday from outside the White House so he could walk across the street to hold up a Bible outside historic St. John's church. It was viewed as a photo opportunity and criticized by the congregation's bishop. McConnell declined to directly comment on Trump's handling of the crisis. However, several Republicans on Tuesday suggested it would be better if Trump helped calm the nation rather than escalate the already tense conditions in Washington and across the country. 'I'm against clearing out a peaceful protest for a photo op that treats the Word of God as a political prop,' said Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Nebraska, in a statement. 'Every public servant in America should be lowering the temperature.' Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer called on Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Army Gen. Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to refuse the use of military helicopters and tear gas for 'ugly stunts' like the one Monday. Senate Democrats proposed, and Republicans rejected, a resolution condemning the president's actions. Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, said he was 'glad the president led' by clearing the protesters from the park. Cruz and other Republicans blamed outside agitators from the 'Antifa' anti-fascist movement from intervening in otherwise peaceful protests that resulted in looting and other property damage. Still, for a growing number of lawmakers there is an undeniable pattern of inequality in the treatment of black Americans by law enforcement they want to address. Several Republicans, including Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, called Floyd's death a 'murder.' One, Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Missouri, said he understood there's a difference between his experience telling his sons to call the police if they need help and black families warning children to be cautious around law enforcement so as not to risk being harmed. 'That's a different kind of America and I think people are understanding those protests make sense,' Blunt said. More than 40 bills "" from banning police choke holds and racial profiling to preventing the federal transfer of military equipment to local law enforcement to a long-sought federal anti-lynching law "" are now under consideration on Capitol Hill. One House Democrat probed the Secret Service for any communication about Trump's ordering the clampdown on protesters outside the White House. Using words like 'dictator' 'fascist' and other terms to describe Trump's actions against the protesters, Democrats pleaded with Americans to stand with those working to improve police treatment of minority populations. 'Racism is bad for everyone,' said Sen. Kamala Harris, D-California. She and Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., among the nation's few black senators post-Reconstruction, spoke of their own childhoods growing up in Civil Rights era, a legacy of the nation's long path toward a more inclusive and representative government. At the Capitol still partly closed by the coronavirus, a Congress that has already struggled with the COVID-19 outbreak that is disproportionately striking black Americans, is now confronting a deepening crisis. The Congressional Black Caucus announced a virtual town hall Friday with civil rights leaders, and House Judiciary Committee chairman Jerrold Nadler said the panel is planning a hearing next week on policing, officials said.

Pelosi invoked Biblical scripture to reject Trump's clampdown on peaceful protesters outside the White House and she drew on past presidents "" including George H.W. Bush in the aftermath of the Rodney King unrest and Barack Obama following the death of Eric Garner "" as models of the nation's chief executive at a time of crisis. 'We would hope that the president of the United States would follow the lead of so many presidents before him to be a healer in chief and not a fanner of the flame,' Pelosi said. As pleas for reconciliation over the country's long struggle with racial inequality were met with demands for accountability over George Floyd's death at the hands of police in Minneapolis, there was a shifting tone coming from Congress. Gone are the days when 'Black Lives Matter' protests were met simply with 'Blue Lives Matter' retorts in support of law enforcement. Instead, Congress seems to have heard the protesters outside its doors. 'You can understand the outrage,' McConnell, the Republican Senate leader, said. McConnell said it's not only the death of Floyd at the hands of white police in Minnesota drawing protesters into the streets, but of other African Americans including Breonna Taylor in his home-state of Kentucky. 'There is no question that there is residual racism in America,' McConnell told reporters. 'It's been a longtime dilemma and we all wish we could get to a better place.' As the world watches a nation in turmoil, Democrats and some Republicans are swiftly preparing inquiries into the president's actions against the protesters and a legislative response to the police violence and racial inequality at the heart of marches erupting in communities nationwide. Trump was widely criticized for clearing protesters late Monday from outside the White House so he could walk across the street to hold up a Bible outside historic St. John's church. It was viewed as a photo opportunity and criticized by the congregation's bishop. McConnell declined to directly comment on Trump's handling of the crisis. However, several Republicans on Tuesday suggested it would be better if Trump helped calm the nation rather than escalate the already tense conditions in Washington and across the country. 'I'm against clearing out a peaceful protest for a photo op that treats the Word of God as a political prop,' said Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Nebraska, in a statement. 'Every public servant in America should be lowering the temperature.' Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer called on Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Army Gen. Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to refuse the use of military helicopters and tear gas for 'ugly stunts' like the one Monday. Senate Democrats proposed, and Republicans rejected, a resolution condemning the president's actions. Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, said he was 'glad the president led' by clearing the protesters from the park. Cruz and other Republicans blamed outside agitators from the 'Antifa' anti-fascist movement from intervening in otherwise peaceful protests that resulted in looting and other property damage. Still, for a growing number of lawmakers there is an undeniable pattern of inequality in the treatment of black Americans by law enforcement they want to address. Several Republicans, including Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, called Floyd's death a 'murder.' One, Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Missouri, said he understood there's a difference between his experience telling his sons to call the police if they need help and black families warning children to be cautious around law enforcement so as not to risk being harmed. 'That's a different kind of America and I think people are understanding those protests make sense,' Blunt said. More than 40 bills "" from banning police choke holds and racial profiling to preventing the federal transfer of military equipment to local law enforcement to a long-sought federal anti-lynching law "" are now under consideration on Capitol Hill. One House Democrat probed the Secret Service for any communication about Trump's ordering the clampdown on protesters outside the White House. Using words like 'dictator' 'fascist' and other terms to describe Trump's actions against the protesters, Democrats pleaded with Americans to stand with those working to improve police treatment of minority populations. 'Racism is bad for everyone,' said Sen. Kamala Harris, D-California. She and Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., among the nation's few black senators post-Reconstruction, spoke of their own childhoods growing up in Civil Rights era, a legacy of the nation's long path toward a more inclusive and representative government. At the Capitol still partly closed by the coronavirus, a Congress that has already struggled with the COVID-19 outbreak that is disproportionately striking black Americans, is now confronting a deepening crisis. The Congressional Black Caucus announced a virtual town hall Friday with civil rights leaders, and House Judiciary Committee chairman Jerrold Nadler said the panel is planning a hearing next week on policing, officials said. Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., said House lawmakers could be recalled to Washington this month to vote on legislation to address police and other reeforms.

(AP Photo/Jae C. Hong) WASHINGTON (AP) — American cities erupted in violence and destruction in a seventh straight night of unrest, with several police officers shot or run over, amid boasts and threats from President Donald Trump to send in troops to “dominate the streets.” In New York, nonviolent protests Monday night were punctuated by people smashing shop windows near Rockefeller Center and breaching the doors of Macy’s flagship store on 34th Street, littering the pavement with broken glass. An SUV plowed into a group of officers at a demonstration in Buffalo, injuring three, including a state trooper who suffered a broken leg and a shattered pelvis. Demonstrations also broke out in such places as Philadelphia, where hundreds of protesters spilled onto a highway in the heart of the city; Atlanta, where police fired tear gas at demonstrators; and Nashville, where more than 60 National Guard members put down their riot shields at the request of peaceful protesters who had gathered in front of Tennessee’s Capitol to honor George Floyd. Bystander Sean Jones, who watched as people ransacked luxury stores in New York over the weekend, said: “People are doing this so next time, before they think about trying to kill another black person, they’re going to be like, ’Damn, we don’t want them out here doing this … again.’” The unrest in Minneapolis appeared to stabilize on the same day Floyd’s brother made an impassioned plea for peace at the spot where a white police officer, Derek Chauvin, put his knee on the handcuffed black man’s neck until he stopped breathing last week. Chauvin has been charged with murder. Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said Tuesday that prosecutors were working as fast as they can to determine if the three other officers at the scene should be charged, too. All four have been fired. The death toll from the unrest rose to at least nine, including two people killed in a Chicago suburb. More than 5,600 people nationwide have been arrested over the past week for such offenses as stealing, blocking highways and breaking curfew, according to a count by The Associated Press. Cities struggled to keep police in line and avoid instances of excessive force. The police chief in Louisville, Kentucky, was fired after a beloved restaurant owner was killed by police and National Guard members enforcing a curfew. In Richmond, Virginia, the police chief said officers who used tear gas on a group of peaceful protesters would be disciplined. An officer was shot shortly before midnight near the Circus Circus casino in Las Vegas. Police had no immediate word on the officer’s condition. Four officers were shot in St. Louis; they were expected to recover. Trump, meanwhile, portrayed himself as a hard-nosed, law-and-order president, with police under federal command using tear gas to clear peaceful demonstrators from a park near the White House so that he could walk to a church and pose with a Bible. Emerging after two days out of public view, he threatened from the White House Rose Garden to deploy “thousands and thousands” of U.S. troops. The photo op at the house of worship known as the Church of the Presidents was condemned by Episcopal Bishop Mariann Edgar Budde. “The president just used a Bible and one of the churches of my diocese as a backdrop for a message antithetical to the teachings of Jesus and everything that our church stands for,” she said. For nearly a week since Floyd’s death, largely peaceful protests by day have turned to chaos at night. “We have been sitting on a powder keg for some time and it has burst,” Philadelphia Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw said. Trump warned that if governors don’t deploy the National Guard in sufficient numbers to “dominate the streets,” the U.S. military will step in to “quickly solve the problem for them.” “We have the greatest country in the world,” the president declared. “We’re going to keep it safe.” As Trump spoke, tear gas canisters could be heard exploding. A military deployment by Trump to U.S. states would mark a stunning federal intervention rarely seen in modern American history. It drew comparisons to 1968, when Richard Nixon ran as the law-and-order candidate in the aftermath of riots following the assassination of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. Trump made little effort to address the grievances of black Americans and others outraged by Floyd’s death and the scourge of police brutality, undermining what his reelection campaign had hoped would be increased appeal to African American voters. Federal law allows presidents to dispatch the military into states to suppress an insurrection or if a state is defying federal law, legal experts said. But officials in New York and other states asserted that the president does not have a unilateral right to send in troops against the will of local governments.

(AP Photo/Andrew Harnik) PHILADELPHIA (AP) — Joe Biden on Tuesday blistered President Donald Trump a day after police drove back peaceful protesters near the White House so Trump could pose with a Bible before a damaged church. Biden said Trump’s “narcissism has become more important than the nation that he leads.” The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee delivered a speech at Philadelphia’s City Hall, addressing the civil unrest across America following the death of George Floyd. Biden said “the moment has come” to deal with systemic racism and deeply ingrained economic inequality — and insisted that the nation can’t wait until November’s election and its outcome. “I call on the Congress to act this month,” Biden said, urging lawmakers to start “with real police reform” and citing proposed legislation outlawing choke holds. But Biden stepped up his criticism of Trump as he works to elevate his voice in the national debate — after more than two months of the campaign for the White House being frozen amid the outbreak of the coronavirus. “This president today is part of the problem and accelerates it,” Biden said, adding that Trump is “consumed with his blinding ego.” Biden’s criticism comes a day after Trump threatened the nation’s governors that he would deploy the military to states if they did not stamp out violent protests over police brutality that have roiled the nation. Authorities under federal command later forced back peaceful demonstrators in Washington with tear gas so the president could walk to nearby church St. John’s Church and pose briefly with a Bible. The church had sustained damage during Sunday protests. Biden noted that “peaceful protesters” were dispersed from the “doorstep of the people’s house, the White House” using tear gas and flash grenades to stage what he called a “photo op” publicity stunt. “The president held up a Bible,” Biden added. “I just wished he opened it once in awhile instead of brandishing it.” The 20-plus minute address was covered live by cable networks and Biden used it to declare, “This job’s not about me. It’s about you. It’s about us.” “Look, the presidency is a big job. Nobody will get everything right. And I won’t either,” Biden said, but promised, “I won’t fan the flames of hate.” As the former vice president spoke, the National Guard maintained a visible presence to defend public buildings as Philadelphia grapples with sustained violent protests. Several adjacent businesses — banks, convenience stores and hotels were boarded up. A very small audience, including Mayor Jim Kenney, was on hand. Biden is trying to create a stark contrast with Trump, who has embraced the language of confrontation and war, casting himself as the “president of law and order.” Trump signaled he would stake his reelection on convincing voters his forceful approach was warranted in a time of national tumult and racial unrest. “I will seek to heal the racial wounds that have long plagued this country – not use them for political gain,” Biden said.",0.0

The S&P 500 was up 0.4%, adding to gains from the day before. Financial, industrial and other stocks that would stand to benefit the most from a growing economy moved higher. Energy companies also rose as the price of crude oil headed higher. Bond yields were mostly higher, another sign of ebbing pessimism among investors. The modest gains have the S&P 500 on track for a three-day winning streak, extending the benchmark index’s remarkable two-month rally off a steep skid in February and March as broad swaths of the U.S. economy ground to a halt due to the coronavirus pandemic. So far, Wall Street’s momentum has not been derailed by the wave of daily unrest across the U.S. that began last week in Minneapolis as a protest over police brutality. Cities across the country have been rocked by violence and destruction for seven days in a row, spurring threats from the White House to send troops in to put down the unrest. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 189 points, or 0.7%, to 25,668. The Nasdaq composite was up 0.2%. Smaller company stocks had some of the biggest gains in the early going. The Russell 2000 index was up 0.8%. NASA astronauts launched into space by SpaceX on Saturday rang the opening bell from the International Space Station early Tuesday to kick off trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Stocks have now recouped most of their losses after the initial economic fallout from the coronavirus knocked the market into a breathtaking 34% skid in February and March. The S&P 500 is now down just under 10% from its all-time high in February. Investors are hoping that the worst of the recession has already passed, or will soon, as governments around the country and around the world slowly lift restrictions meant to corral the outbreak. In Europe, France’s CAC 40 jumped 2.1% Tuesday as the country opened restaurants, cafes, parks and beaches and launched a contract tracing app to help keep tabs on new contagions. Germany’s DAX, which had been closed Monday, caught up with previous global markets’ gains and surged 3.7%. Britain’s FTSE 100 added 0.9%. Markets in Asia closed broadly higher. While more countries and sectors are reopening, activity is expected to remain subdued as social distancing rules complicate plans to get back to business. And fears persist about a possible resurgence in coronavirus outbreaks in some countries. There were 34 new confirmed cases in Tokyo on Tuesday, seeming to reaffirm growing risks as people begin to mingle more in crowded commuter trains with the reopenings of more offices, schools, restaurants and stores.

If you miss the live report, you’ll be able to see a replay minutes after the stream ends. WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. officials vowed to “maximize federal law enforcement presence” in the nation’s capital after days of violent demonstrations led to fires across Washington and left scores of businesses with broken windows and dozens of police officers injured. In a call with governors Monday, President Donald Trump and Attorney General William Barr also encouraged more aggressive action against those who cause violence during protests across the country following the killing of George Floyd, a black man who died after a white Minneapolis policeman pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes even after Floyd stopped moving and pleading for air. The demonstrations have turned violent in several cities, with fires ignited in Lafayette Park across from the White House. The comments from Trump, Barr and other federal officials appeared aimed at avoiding similar scenes Monday night. But there were also questions about whether using more aggressive law enforcement measures against demonstrators protesting police brutality would only increase tensions. Barr told the state leaders that law enforcement officials must “have adequate force” and “go after troublemakers.” “Law enforcement response is not going to work unless we dominate the streets,” Barr said. Trump said he was “taking immediate presidential action to stop the violence and restore security and safety in America.” The president urged governors to deploy the National Guard, which he credited with helping calm the situation Sunday night in Minneapolis, and demanded that similarly tough measures be taken in cities that also experienced spasms of violence, including New York, Philadelphia and Los Angeles. “Mayors and governors must establish an overwhelming law enforcement presence until the violence has been quelled,” Trump said. “If a city or state refuses to take the actions that are necessary to defend the life and property of their residents, then I will deploy the United States military and quickly solve the problem for them.” Trump directed Barr to “lead federal law enforcement efforts to assist in the restoration of order to the District of Columbia,” Justice Department spokesperson Kerri Kupec said. Minutes before Trump spoke Monday evening in the Rose Garden of the White House, police and members of the National Guard took aggressive action, using tear gas and flash bangs, to move back peaceful protesters who were outside Lafayette Park, across from the White House. Law enforcement officials had made a decision earlier Monday that they needed to extend the security perimeter around the White House after multiple fires broke out in Lafayette Park the night before, according to a law enforcement official who would not publicly discuss the security protocols and spoke on condition of anonymity. After speaking in the Rose Garden, Trump then walked slowly out of the White House gates, senior aides and security with him, across the park to the landmark St. John’s Church, where every president, including Trump, has prayed. It had been damaged Sunday night in a protest fire. Trump then stood alone in front of cameras and raised a Bible — and declared, “We have a great country,” he said. “Greatest country in the world.” Officials in Arlington, Virginia, later ordered the county’s police, who were helping with crowd control in Lafayette Square under a mutual aid request from U.S. Park Police, to leave Monday night. Arlington County Board Chair Libby Garvey tweeted that she was “appalled” that the mutual aid agreement was “abused to endanger their and others safety for a photo op” by Trump. A statement from the county said it was “re-evaluating the agreements that allowed our officers to be put in a compromising position that endangered their health and safety, and that of the people around them, for a purpose not worthy of our mutual aid obligations.” A Justice Department spokesperson declined to comment when asked whether Barr was involved in the decision to use tear gas on protesters outside the White House. A U.S. Park Police spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Between the protests and the response to the coronavirus pandemic, the National Guard has been deployed at its highest level in recent history, surpassing the number of troops sent to the Gulf Coast during Hurricane Katrina in 2005. More than 66,700 soldiers and airman have been activated — 45,000 to assist with the pandemic and more than 17,000 to help with the protests. Other law enforcement resources are also being mobilized. The Justice Department deployed the U.S. Marshals Service and agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration to supplement National Guard troops in Washington on Sunday. By midnight, Barr had ordered the FBI to deploy its Hostage Rescue Team, an elite tactical unit, to the streets of the nation’s capital, a senior Justice Department official said. Barr was traveling around Washington on Monday night to observe the protests, according to the senior Justice Department official, who would not discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. The U.S. Park Police and Secret Service have had dozens of officers out in riot gear in Washington for the last few nights, in addition to the Metropolitan Police Department. U.S. Customs and Border Protection was also sending officers, agents and aircraft around the country to assist other law enforcement agencies “confronting the lawless actions of rioters,” the agency said. The officers were being deployed in several states, though the official declined to provide specific details, citing security concerns. Several major cities have enacted curfews, and District of Columbia Mayor Muriel Bowser set a 7 p.m. curfew for Monday and Tuesday. Violent demonstrators ignored the 11 p.m. curfew the night before as they set buildings and trash cans on fire and broke into stores to steal items from the shelves. Most of the protesters have been peaceful and tried to discourage violence. Trump, Barr and others have tried to blame some of the civil unrest on left-wing extremist groups, including antifa, and other “anarchists.” Short for anti-fascists, antifa is an umbrella term for far-left-leaning militant groups that resist neo-Nazis and white supremacists at demonstrations. The FBI is using its network of regional joint terrorism task forces to “identify criminal organizers,” and federal prosecutors across the country have been instructed to share information and utilize federal riot, arson or terror statutes against any “violent radical agitators” who attempt to hijack protests to cause destruction. The Justice Department has vowed to treat the “violence instigated and carried out by antifa & other similar groups” as domestic terrorism. Although there isn’t a specific federal domestic terrorism statute, prosecutors could charge other offenses and seek enhanced sentencing. Between 600 and 800 National Guard members from five states — Delaware, New Jersey, New York, Ohio and Utah — are being sent to D.C. to provide assistance, senior Defense Department officials said. Those troops are either already on the ground or will arrive by midnight. In addition, officials said that soldiers from Fort Bragg, North Carolina, and Fort Drum, New York, were heading to D.C. and would be based outside the city in case they are needed. They would be prepared to respond, but the officials said they are hopeful those troops will not be needed. If they are sent in, they are not expected to be conducting any law enforcement. The officials declined to say how many active-duty troops were en route. ___ Associated Press writers Lolita C.

'He thinks division helps him,' the presumptive Democratic nominee said in a speech at Philadelphia's City Hall. 'This narcissism has become more important than the nation's well-being.' Biden seized on police driving back peaceful protesters near the White House on Monday so Trump could briefly pose with a Bible before nearby St. John's Church. 'If he opened it instead of brandishing it, he could have learned something,"" Biden said as he chided authorities for using 'tear gas and flash grenades in order to stage a photo op."" Biden said Trump ""might also want to open the U.S. Constitution. If he did, he'd find the First Amendment. It protects the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.' Biden's address marked a new phase of a presidential campaign that had been effectively frozen for two-plus months by the spread of the coronavirus. The former vice president is now emerging from his Delaware home to confront Trump every day "" and using in-person appearances to offer direct competition with the president, rather than relying on virtual events that often failed to garner a lot of attention. It was the third consecutive day that Biden made a public appearance and the first time he's been out of the state since March. His remarks were carried live on the three major cable news networks. Biden delivered the remarks as upheaval in the wake of George Floyd's death has spread around the country. While Biden spoke, the National Guard maintained a visible presence to defend public buildings as Philadelphia continues to face sustained violent protests. Several buildings adjacent to City Hall, including banks, convenience stores and hotels, were boarded up. He spoke of the 'tug of war between the American ideal that we are all created equal and the harsh reality that racism has long torn us apart.' 'The honest truth is both elements are part of the American character,"" he said. Since the early days of his candidacy, Biden has framed the election as a 'battle for the soul of the nation.' He went into greater detail on Tuesday about what that meant and the questions voters should ask themselves. 'I ask every American to look at where we are now, and think anew: Is this who we are?' he said. 'Is this who we want to be? Is this what we pass on to our kids' and grandkids' lives? Fear and finger-pointing rather than hope and the pursuit of happiness? Incompetence and anxiety? Self-absorption and selfishness?' The tone was part of Biden's effort to cast himself as a 'consoler in chief"" in stark contrast to Trump's blunt, confrontational style. While he said his anguish over the death of his son Beau Biden five years ago from cancer isn't the same as the sadness felt by those protesting police brutality, he said he understood the hopelessness that can come with grief. 'Like many of you, I know what it's like to grieve,' Biden said. 'I know what it feels like when you're thinking you can't go on.' He said 'bad cops should be dealt with severely and swiftly' and offered examples of how he might ease racial tensions and govern. He called on Congress to act now on legislation that would place a federal ban on police using choke holds. Biden also promised to increase access to health care and improve the pay of first-responders and other workers who have stayed on jobs deemed essential during the pandemic, should he win the presidency. But Biden's speech was perhaps most notable for its ferocity. He accused the president of being more worried about himself than the nation at a time when it 'is crying out for leadership.' 'This president today is part of the problem and accelerates it,' Biden said, adding that Trump is 'consumed with his blinding ego.' Biden also offered a stark departure from Trump, who tweeted before Biden spoke that Washington 'had no problems last night' and cited 'many arrests,' as well as 'overwhelming force' and 'Domination' for which he thanked himself. Trump has embraced the language of confrontation and war, seeking to be a 'president of law and order,"" and betting that voters will want a more forceful approach at a time of national tumult and racial unrest. Katrina Pierson, a senior adviser to the president's reelection campaign, said Biden's speech 'obviously made the crass political calculation that unrest in America is a benefit to his candidacy.' 'President Trump is restoring the nation to order and is clearly the leader we need to return the country to peace and prosperity,' she said in a statement. Despite his more confrontational approach, Biden was direct about the limits of his ability to singularly reconcile the nation's differences. He was careful to note that his administration won't be able to fix everything, especially not all at once. 'I know that the presidency, that's a very big job,"" he said. 'Nobody will get it right every time and I won't either,"" Biden said. But he vowed not to 'traffic in fear and division."" 'I won't fan the flames of hate,' he said.

'I'm against clearing out a peaceful protest for a photo op that treats the Word of God as a political prop,' said Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Nebraska, in a statement. 'Every public servant in America should be lowering the temperature.' Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer called on Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Army Gen. Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to refuse the use of military helicopters and tear gas for 'ugly stunts' like the one Monday. Senate Democrats proposed, and Republicans rejected, a resolution condemning the president's actions. Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, said he was 'glad the president led' by clearing the protesters from the park. Cruz and other Republicans blamed outside agitators from the 'Antifa' anti-fascist movement from intervening in otherwise peaceful protests that resulted in looting and other property damage. Still, for a growing number of lawmakers there is an undeniable pattern of inequality in the treatment of black Americans by law enforcement they want to address. Several Republicans, including Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, called Floyd's death a 'murder.' One, Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Missouri, said he understood there's a difference between his experience telling his sons to call the police if they need help and black families warning children to be cautious around law enforcement so as not to risk being harmed. 'That's a different kind of America and I think people are understanding those protests make sense,' Blunt said. More than 40 bills "" from banning police choke holds and racial profiling to preventing the federal transfer of military equipment to local law enforcement to a long-sought federal anti-lynching law "" are now under consideration on Capitol Hill. One House Democrat probed the Secret Service for any communication about Trump's ordering the clampdown on protesters outside the White House. Using words like 'dictator' 'fascist' and other terms to describe Trump's actions against the protesters, Democrats pleaded with Americans to stand with those working to improve police treatment of minority populations. 'Racism is bad for everyone,' said Sen. Kamala Harris, D-California. She and Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., among the nation's few black senators post-Reconstruction, spoke of their own childhoods growing up in Civil Rights era, a legacy of the nation's long path toward a more inclusive and representative government. At the Capitol still partly closed by the coronavirus, a Congress that has already struggled with the COVID-19 outbreak that is disproportionately striking black Americans, is now confronting a deepening crisis. The Congressional Black Caucus announced a virtual town hall Friday with civil rights leaders, and House Judiciary Committee chairman Jerrold Nadler said the panel is planning a hearing next week on policing, officials said. Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., said House lawmakers could be recalled to Washington this month to vote on legislation to address police and other reeforms. Schumer urged McConnell to consider law enforcement reforms legislation by July 4. ___ Associated Press writer Matthew Daly contributed to this report.",0.0

(AP Photo/Jae C. Hong) WASHINGTON (AP) — American cities erupted in violence and destruction in a seventh straight night of unrest, with several police officers shot or run over, amid boasts and threats from President Donald Trump to send in troops to “dominate the streets.” In New York, nonviolent protests Monday night were punctuated by people smashing shop windows near Rockefeller Center and breaching the doors of Macy’s flagship store on 34th Street, littering the pavement with broken glass. An SUV plowed into a group of officers at a demonstration in Buffalo, injuring three, including a state trooper who suffered a broken leg and a shattered pelvis. Demonstrations also broke out in such places as Philadelphia, where hundreds of protesters spilled onto a highway in the heart of the city; Atlanta, where police fired tear gas at demonstrators; and Nashville, where more than 60 National Guard members put down their riot shields at the request of peaceful protesters who had gathered in front of Tennessee’s Capitol to honor George Floyd. Bystander Sean Jones, who watched as people ransacked luxury stores in New York over the weekend, said: “People are doing this so next time, before they think about trying to kill another black person, they’re going to be like, ’Damn, we don’t want them out here doing this … again.’” The unrest in Minneapolis appeared to stabilize on the same day Floyd’s brother made an impassioned plea for peace at the spot where a white police officer, Derek Chauvin, put his knee on the handcuffed black man’s neck until he stopped breathing last week. Chauvin has been charged with murder. Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said Tuesday that prosecutors were working as fast as they can to determine if the three other officers at the scene should be charged, too. All four have been fired. The death toll from the unrest rose to at least nine, including two people killed in a Chicago suburb. More than 5,600 people nationwide have been arrested over the past week for such offenses as stealing, blocking highways and breaking curfew, according to a count by The Associated Press. Cities struggled to keep police in line and avoid instances of excessive force. The police chief in Louisville, Kentucky, was fired after a beloved restaurant owner was killed by police and National Guard members enforcing a curfew. In Richmond, Virginia, the police chief said officers who used tear gas on a group of peaceful protesters would be disciplined. An officer was shot shortly before midnight near the Circus Circus casino in Las Vegas. Police had no immediate word on the officer’s condition. Four officers were shot in St. Louis; they were expected to recover. Trump, meanwhile, portrayed himself as a hard-nosed, law-and-order president, with police under federal command using tear gas to clear peaceful demonstrators from a park near the White House so that he could walk to a church and pose with a Bible. Emerging after two days out of public view, he threatened from the White House Rose Garden to deploy “thousands and thousands” of U.S. troops. The photo op at the house of worship known as the Church of the Presidents was condemned by Episcopal Bishop Mariann Edgar Budde. “The president just used a Bible and one of the churches of my diocese as a backdrop for a message antithetical to the teachings of Jesus and everything that our church stands for,” she said. For nearly a week since Floyd’s death, largely peaceful protests by day have turned to chaos at night. “We have been sitting on a powder keg for some time and it has burst,” Philadelphia Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw said. Trump warned that if governors don’t deploy the National Guard in sufficient numbers to “dominate the streets,” the U.S. military will step in to “quickly solve the problem for them.” “We have the greatest country in the world,” the president declared. “We’re going to keep it safe.” As Trump spoke, tear gas canisters could be heard exploding. A military deployment by Trump to U.S. states would mark a stunning federal intervention rarely seen in modern American history. It drew comparisons to 1968, when Richard Nixon ran as the law-and-order candidate in the aftermath of riots following the assassination of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. Trump made little effort to address the grievances of black Americans and others outraged by Floyd’s death and the scourge of police brutality, undermining what his reelection campaign had hoped would be increased appeal to African American voters. Federal law allows presidents to dispatch the military into states to suppress an insurrection or if a state is defying federal law, legal experts said. But officials in New York and other states asserted that the president does not have a unilateral right to send in troops against the will of local governments.

(AP Photo/Andrew Harnik) PHILADELPHIA (AP) — Joe Biden on Tuesday blistered President Donald Trump a day after police drove back peaceful protesters near the White House so Trump could pose with a Bible before a damaged church. Biden said Trump’s “narcissism has become more important than the nation that he leads.” The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee delivered a speech at Philadelphia’s City Hall, addressing the civil unrest across America following the death of George Floyd. Biden said “the moment has come” to deal with systemic racism and deeply ingrained economic inequality — and insisted that the nation can’t wait until November’s election and its outcome. “I call on the Congress to act this month,” Biden said, urging lawmakers to start “with real police reform” and citing proposed legislation outlawing choke holds. But Biden stepped up his criticism of Trump as he works to elevate his voice in the national debate — after more than two months of the campaign for the White House being frozen amid the outbreak of the coronavirus. “This president today is part of the problem and accelerates it,” Biden said, adding that Trump is “consumed with his blinding ego.” Biden’s criticism comes a day after Trump threatened the nation’s governors that he would deploy the military to states if they did not stamp out violent protests over police brutality that have roiled the nation. Authorities under federal command later forced back peaceful demonstrators in Washington with tear gas so the president could walk to nearby church St. John’s Church and pose briefly with a Bible. The church had sustained damage during Sunday protests. Biden noted that “peaceful protesters” were dispersed from the “doorstep of the people’s house, the White House” using tear gas and flash grenades to stage what he called a “photo op” publicity stunt. “The president held up a Bible,” Biden added. “I just wished he opened it once in awhile instead of brandishing it.” The 20-plus minute address was covered live by cable networks and Biden used it to declare, “This job’s not about me. It’s about you. It’s about us.” “Look, the presidency is a big job. Nobody will get everything right. And I won’t either,” Biden said, but promised, “I won’t fan the flames of hate.” As the former vice president spoke, the National Guard maintained a visible presence to defend public buildings as Philadelphia grapples with sustained violent protests. Several adjacent businesses — banks, convenience stores and hotels were boarded up. A very small audience, including Mayor Jim Kenney, was on hand. Biden is trying to create a stark contrast with Trump, who has embraced the language of confrontation and war, casting himself as the “president of law and order.” Trump signaled he would stake his reelection on convincing voters his forceful approach was warranted in a time of national tumult and racial unrest. “I will seek to heal the racial wounds that have long plagued this country – not use them for political gain,” Biden said.",0.0

The S&P 500 was up 0.4%, adding to gains from the day before. Financial, industrial and other stocks that would stand to benefit the most from a growing economy moved higher. Energy companies also rose as the price of crude oil headed higher. Bond yields were mostly higher, another sign of ebbing pessimism among investors. The modest gains have the S&P 500 on track for a three-day winning streak, extending the benchmark index’s remarkable two-month rally off a steep skid in February and March as broad swaths of the U.S. economy ground to a halt due to the coronavirus pandemic. So far, Wall Street’s momentum has not been derailed by the wave of daily unrest across the U.S. that began last week in Minneapolis as a protest over police brutality. Cities across the country have been rocked by violence and destruction for seven days in a row, spurring threats from the White House to send troops in to put down the unrest. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 189 points, or 0.7%, to 25,668. The Nasdaq composite was up 0.2%. Smaller company stocks had some of the biggest gains in the early going. The Russell 2000 index was up 0.8%. NASA astronauts launched into space by SpaceX on Saturday rang the opening bell from the International Space Station early Tuesday to kick off trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Stocks have now recouped most of their losses after the initial economic fallout from the coronavirus knocked the market into a breathtaking 34% skid in February and March. The S&P 500 is now down just under 10% from its all-time high in February. Investors are hoping that the worst of the recession has already passed, or will soon, as governments around the country and around the world slowly lift restrictions meant to corral the outbreak. In Europe, France’s CAC 40 jumped 2.1% Tuesday as the country opened restaurants, cafes, parks and beaches and launched a contract tracing app to help keep tabs on new contagions. Germany’s DAX, which had been closed Monday, caught up with previous global markets’ gains and surged 3.7%. Britain’s FTSE 100 added 0.9%. Markets in Asia closed broadly higher. While more countries and sectors are reopening, activity is expected to remain subdued as social distancing rules complicate plans to get back to business. And fears persist about a possible resurgence in coronavirus outbreaks in some countries. There were 34 new confirmed cases in Tokyo on Tuesday, seeming to reaffirm growing risks as people begin to mingle more in crowded commuter trains with the reopenings of more offices, schools, restaurants and stores.

If you miss the live report, you’ll be able to see a replay minutes after the stream ends. WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. officials vowed to “maximize federal law enforcement presence” in the nation’s capital after days of violent demonstrations led to fires across Washington and left scores of businesses with broken windows and dozens of police officers injured. In a call with governors Monday, President Donald Trump and Attorney General William Barr also encouraged more aggressive action against those who cause violence during protests across the country following the killing of George Floyd, a black man who died after a white Minneapolis policeman pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes even after Floyd stopped moving and pleading for air. The demonstrations have turned violent in several cities, with fires ignited in Lafayette Park across from the White House. The comments from Trump, Barr and other federal officials appeared aimed at avoiding similar scenes Monday night. But there were also questions about whether using more aggressive law enforcement measures against demonstrators protesting police brutality would only increase tensions. Barr told the state leaders that law enforcement officials must “have adequate force” and “go after troublemakers.” “Law enforcement response is not going to work unless we dominate the streets,” Barr said. Trump said he was “taking immediate presidential action to stop the violence and restore security and safety in America.” The president urged governors to deploy the National Guard, which he credited with helping calm the situation Sunday night in Minneapolis, and demanded that similarly tough measures be taken in cities that also experienced spasms of violence, including New York, Philadelphia and Los Angeles. “Mayors and governors must establish an overwhelming law enforcement presence until the violence has been quelled,” Trump said. “If a city or state refuses to take the actions that are necessary to defend the life and property of their residents, then I will deploy the United States military and quickly solve the problem for them.” Trump directed Barr to “lead federal law enforcement efforts to assist in the restoration of order to the District of Columbia,” Justice Department spokesperson Kerri Kupec said. Minutes before Trump spoke Monday evening in the Rose Garden of the White House, police and members of the National Guard took aggressive action, using tear gas and flash bangs, to move back peaceful protesters who were outside Lafayette Park, across from the White House. Law enforcement officials had made a decision earlier Monday that they needed to extend the security perimeter around the White House after multiple fires broke out in Lafayette Park the night before, according to a law enforcement official who would not publicly discuss the security protocols and spoke on condition of anonymity. After speaking in the Rose Garden, Trump then walked slowly out of the White House gates, senior aides and security with him, across the park to the landmark St. John’s Church, where every president, including Trump, has prayed. It had been damaged Sunday night in a protest fire. Trump then stood alone in front of cameras and raised a Bible — and declared, “We have a great country,” he said. “Greatest country in the world.” Officials in Arlington, Virginia, later ordered the county’s police, who were helping with crowd control in Lafayette Square under a mutual aid request from U.S. Park Police, to leave Monday night. Arlington County Board Chair Libby Garvey tweeted that she was “appalled” that the mutual aid agreement was “abused to endanger their and others safety for a photo op” by Trump. A statement from the county said it was “re-evaluating the agreements that allowed our officers to be put in a compromising position that endangered their health and safety, and that of the people around them, for a purpose not worthy of our mutual aid obligations.” A Justice Department spokesperson declined to comment when asked whether Barr was involved in the decision to use tear gas on protesters outside the White House. A U.S. Park Police spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Between the protests and the response to the coronavirus pandemic, the National Guard has been deployed at its highest level in recent history, surpassing the number of troops sent to the Gulf Coast during Hurricane Katrina in 2005. More than 66,700 soldiers and airman have been activated — 45,000 to assist with the pandemic and more than 17,000 to help with the protests. Other law enforcement resources are also being mobilized. The Justice Department deployed the U.S. Marshals Service and agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration to supplement National Guard troops in Washington on Sunday. By midnight, Barr had ordered the FBI to deploy its Hostage Rescue Team, an elite tactical unit, to the streets of the nation’s capital, a senior Justice Department official said. Barr was traveling around Washington on Monday night to observe the protests, according to the senior Justice Department official, who would not discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. The U.S. Park Police and Secret Service have had dozens of officers out in riot gear in Washington for the last few nights, in addition to the Metropolitan Police Department. U.S. Customs and Border Protection was also sending officers, agents and aircraft around the country to assist other law enforcement agencies “confronting the lawless actions of rioters,” the agency said. The officers were being deployed in several states, though the official declined to provide specific details, citing security concerns. Several major cities have enacted curfews, and District of Columbia Mayor Muriel Bowser set a 7 p.m. curfew for Monday and Tuesday. Violent demonstrators ignored the 11 p.m. curfew the night before as they set buildings and trash cans on fire and broke into stores to steal items from the shelves. Most of the protesters have been peaceful and tried to discourage violence. Trump, Barr and others have tried to blame some of the civil unrest on left-wing extremist groups, including antifa, and other “anarchists.” Short for anti-fascists, antifa is an umbrella term for far-left-leaning militant groups that resist neo-Nazis and white supremacists at demonstrations. The FBI is using its network of regional joint terrorism task forces to “identify criminal organizers,” and federal prosecutors across the country have been instructed to share information and utilize federal riot, arson or terror statutes against any “violent radical agitators” who attempt to hijack protests to cause destruction. The Justice Department has vowed to treat the “violence instigated and carried out by antifa & other similar groups” as domestic terrorism. Although there isn’t a specific federal domestic terrorism statute, prosecutors could charge other offenses and seek enhanced sentencing. Between 600 and 800 National Guard members from five states — Delaware, New Jersey, New York, Ohio and Utah — are being sent to D.C. to provide assistance, senior Defense Department officials said. Those troops are either already on the ground or will arrive by midnight. In addition, officials said that soldiers from Fort Bragg, North Carolina, and Fort Drum, New York, were heading to D.C. and would be based outside the city in case they are needed. They would be prepared to respond, but the officials said they are hopeful those troops will not be needed. If they are sent in, they are not expected to be conducting any law enforcement. The officials declined to say how many active-duty troops were en route. ___ Associated Press writers Lolita C.

'He thinks division helps him,' the presumptive Democratic nominee said in a speech at Philadelphia's City Hall. 'This narcissism has become more important than the nation's well-being.' Biden seized on police driving back peaceful protesters near the White House on Monday so Trump could briefly pose with a Bible before nearby St. John's Church. 'If he opened it instead of brandishing it, he could have learned something,"" Biden said as he chided authorities for using 'tear gas and flash grenades in order to stage a photo op."" Biden said Trump ""might also want to open the U.S. Constitution. If he did, he'd find the First Amendment. It protects the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.' Biden's address marked a new phase of a presidential campaign that had been effectively frozen for two-plus months by the spread of the coronavirus. The former vice president is now emerging from his Delaware home to confront Trump every day "" and using in-person appearances to offer direct competition with the president, rather than relying on virtual events that often failed to garner a lot of attention. It was the third consecutive day that Biden made a public appearance and the first time he's been out of the state since March. His remarks were carried live on the three major cable news networks. Biden delivered the remarks as upheaval in the wake of George Floyd's death has spread around the country. While Biden spoke, the National Guard maintained a visible presence to defend public buildings as Philadelphia continues to face sustained violent protests. Several buildings adjacent to City Hall, including banks, convenience stores and hotels, were boarded up. He spoke of the 'tug of war between the American ideal that we are all created equal and the harsh reality that racism has long torn us apart.' 'The honest truth is both elements are part of the American character,"" he said. Since the early days of his candidacy, Biden has framed the election as a 'battle for the soul of the nation.' He went into greater detail on Tuesday about what that meant and the questions voters should ask themselves. 'I ask every American to look at where we are now, and think anew: Is this who we are?' he said. 'Is this who we want to be? Is this what we pass on to our kids' and grandkids' lives? Fear and finger-pointing rather than hope and the pursuit of happiness? Incompetence and anxiety? Self-absorption and selfishness?' The tone was part of Biden's effort to cast himself as a 'consoler in chief"" in stark contrast to Trump's blunt, confrontational style. While he said his anguish over the death of his son Beau Biden five years ago from cancer isn't the same as the sadness felt by those protesting police brutality, he said he understood the hopelessness that can come with grief. 'Like many of you, I know what it's like to grieve,' Biden said. 'I know what it feels like when you're thinking you can't go on.' He said 'bad cops should be dealt with severely and swiftly' and offered examples of how he might ease racial tensions and govern. He called on Congress to act now on legislation that would place a federal ban on police using choke holds. Biden also promised to increase access to health care and improve the pay of first-responders and other workers who have stayed on jobs deemed essential during the pandemic, should he win the presidency. But Biden's speech was perhaps most notable for its ferocity. He accused the president of being more worried about himself than the nation at a time when it 'is crying out for leadership.' 'This president today is part of the problem and accelerates it,' Biden said, adding that Trump is 'consumed with his blinding ego.' Biden also offered a stark departure from Trump, who tweeted before Biden spoke that Washington 'had no problems last night' and cited 'many arrests,' as well as 'overwhelming force' and 'Domination' for which he thanked himself. Trump has embraced the language of confrontation and war, seeking to be a 'president of law and order,"" and betting that voters will want a more forceful approach at a time of national tumult and racial unrest. Katrina Pierson, a senior adviser to the president's reelection campaign, said Biden's speech 'obviously made the crass political calculation that unrest in America is a benefit to his candidacy.' 'President Trump is restoring the nation to order and is clearly the leader we need to return the country to peace and prosperity,' she said in a statement. Despite his more confrontational approach, Biden was direct about the limits of his ability to singularly reconcile the nation's differences. He was careful to note that his administration won't be able to fix everything, especially not all at once. 'I know that the presidency, that's a very big job,"" he said. 'Nobody will get it right every time and I won't either,"" Biden said. But he vowed not to 'traffic in fear and division."" 'I won't fan the flames of hate,' he said.

Pelosi invoked Biblical scripture to reject Trump's clampdown on peaceful protesters outside the White House and she drew on past presidents "" including George H.W. Bush in the aftermath of the Rodney King unrest and Barack Obama following the death of Eric Garner "" as models of the nation's chief executive at a time of crisis. 'We would hope that the president of the United States would follow the lead of so many presidents before him to be a healer in chief and not a fanner of the flame,' Pelosi said. As pleas for reconciliation over the country's long struggle with racial inequality were met with demands for accountability over George Floyd's death at the hands of police in Minneapolis, there was a shifting tone coming from Congress. Gone are the days when 'Black Lives Matter' protests were met simply with 'Blue Lives Matter' retorts in support of law enforcement. Instead, Congress seems to have heard the protesters outside its doors. 'You can understand the outrage,' McConnell, the Republican Senate leader, said. McConnell said it's not only the death of Floyd at the hands of white police in Minnesota drawing protesters into the streets, but of other African Americans including Breonna Taylor in his home-state of Kentucky. 'There is no question that there is residual racism in America,' McConnell told reporters. 'It's been a longtime dilemma and we all wish we could get to a better place.' As the world watches a nation in turmoil, Democrats and some Republicans are swiftly preparing inquiries into the president's actions against the protesters and a legislative response to the police violence and racial inequality at the heart of marches erupting in communities nationwide. Trump was widely criticized for clearing protesters late Monday from outside the White House so he could walk across the street to hold up a Bible outside historic St. John's church. It was viewed as a photo opportunity and criticized by the congregation's bishop. McConnell declined to directly comment on Trump's handling of the crisis. However, several Republicans on Tuesday suggested it would be better if Trump helped calm the nation rather than escalate the already tense conditions in Washington and across the country. 'I'm against clearing out a peaceful protest for a photo op that treats the Word of God as a political prop,' said Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Nebraska, in a statement. 'Every public servant in America should be lowering the temperature.' Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer called on Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Army Gen. Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to refuse the use of military helicopters and tear gas for 'ugly stunts' like the one Monday. Senate Democrats proposed, and Republicans rejected, a resolution condemning the president's actions. Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, said he was 'glad the president led' by clearing the protesters from the park. Cruz and other Republicans blamed outside agitators from the 'Antifa' anti-fascist movement from intervening in otherwise peaceful protests that resulted in looting and other property damage. Still, for a growing number of lawmakers there is an undeniable pattern of inequality in the treatment of black Americans by law enforcement they want to address. Several Republicans, including Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, called Floyd's death a 'murder.' One, Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Missouri, said he understood there's a difference between his experience telling his sons to call the police if they need help and black families warning children to be cautious around law enforcement so as not to risk being harmed. 'That's a different kind of America and I think people are understanding those protests make sense,' Blunt said. More than 40 bills "" from banning police choke holds and racial profiling to preventing the federal transfer of military equipment to local law enforcement to a long-sought federal anti-lynching law "" are now under consideration on Capitol Hill. One House Democrat probed the Secret Service for any communication about Trump's ordering the clampdown on protesters outside the White House. Using words like 'dictator' 'fascist' and other terms to describe Trump's actions against the protesters, Democrats pleaded with Americans to stand with those working to improve police treatment of minority populations. 'Racism is bad for everyone,' said Sen. Kamala Harris, D-California. She and Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., among the nation's few black senators post-Reconstruction, spoke of their own childhoods growing up in Civil Rights era, a legacy of the nation's long path toward a more inclusive and representative government. At the Capitol still partly closed by the coronavirus, a Congress that has already struggled with the COVID-19 outbreak that is disproportionately striking black Americans, is now confronting a deepening crisis. The Congressional Black Caucus announced a virtual town hall Friday with civil rights leaders, and House Judiciary Committee chairman Jerrold Nadler said the panel is planning a hearing next week on policing, officials said.

In Providence, meanwhile, a demonstration on Saturday afternoon remained peaceful, although there was vandalism at the State House later that night. Check back with providencejournal.com later today; we're talking to some of the organizers of Saturday's event about their future plans. The conversation has resonated strongly in the sports world, and last night New England Patriots teammates, and twin brothers Devin and Jason McCourty hosted a roundtable conversation about racial injustice. Today is the beginning of phase two of the state's gradual reopening. Barbershops, hair salons and gyms are among the many categories of business that can begin reopening with restrictions. Additionally, restaurants can begin indoor dining, limited to 50% of their usual capacity and with a laundry list of new rules to follow. Gail Ciampa reports that some restaurants are diving right in and others are taking it slow. Last weekend, houses of worship were allowed to resume in-person services at no more than 25% capacity. At one church in Narragansett, the priest offered Communion from behind a plexiglass shield. The number of patients in Rhode Island hospitals with coronavirus has dipped below 200 for the first time since early April. The state also reported just two new coronavirus-related deaths and 67 additional positive cases, also the lowest number since early April, and said that only about 4% of the most recent round of tests came back positive.

The officer, Derek Chauvin, has been charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. Three other officers who were on scene at the time were fired from the Minneapolis Police Department but have yet to be charged. Protesters who gathered in Burnside Park on Saturday before marching to the State House said they felt angry and heartbroken over Floyd’s death and exhausted by the repeated killings of black people by police in America. The killings of Ahmaud Arbery, a 25-year-old unarmed black man who was shot while jogging in Glynn County, Georgia, and Breonna Taylor, a black woman who was shot while she was sleeping in her apartment in Louisville, Kentucky, have also sparked protests recently. “Year in and year out, nothing changes as far as the criminal justice system in this country,” said Shawn Holloway, 40, of Pawtucket, who held a “Black Lives Matter Rhode Island” sign over his head by the fountain in Burnside Park. “Black men and women are looked at as second-class citizens, and to this day we have to earn our right to be equal.” Protesters, most of whom wore face masks and carried signs, chanted, “No justice, no peace,” “black lives matter,” and “I can’t breathe” in reference to Floyd, who repeatedly told the officer kneeling on his neck that he couldn’t breathe. The phrase became a rallying cry for the Black Lives Matter movement after Eric Garner, a black man killed by police in New York in 2014, said “I can’t breathe” as white officers held him in a chokehold. “We are tired,” said Matt Williams, 33, of North Providence. “We are tired of being disrespected. We are tired of being looked over. We are ready for change.” The novel coronavirus pandemic and the social-distancing measures put in place to help mitigate transmission of the virus didn’t deter protesters from gathering on Saturday. “I want to stay safe because of coronavirus, but at the same time, this is bigger than coronavirus,” said Williams, who wore a black bandanna over his nose and mouth. “This is something that’s been going on forever. … I’m ready to stand for what I believe in and because of that, coronavirus or anything else, I’m going to be out here, front lines, standing for black people.” While protests in other cities have resulted in looting, rioting and violence in some cases, Saturday’s rally in Providence was peaceful. As she walked with other protesters from Burnside Park to the State House, Ridgshana Nonau, 21, of Providence, said that she is studying to become a detective so that she can represent the black community within the criminal justice system. “I’m putting myself out there so I can be one of the good ones that can bring peace and can change everything that’s happening,” she said. Watching the video of Floyd’s killing, she said, brought her to tears. “Literally, my heart just broke,” she said. “I cried and I was speechless. … I’m tired of it. This is not the first time. And I want it to be the last time.”",0.0
1623432062,2020-06-02 05:01:26,"Officials see extremist groups, disinformation in protests",https://www.providencejournal.com/news/20200601/officials-see-extremist-groups-disinformation-in-protests,en,True,"politics and government, demonstrations and riots",658834,State News - United States - Rhode Island,http://www.rhodeisland.statenews.net/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. officials are seeking to determine whether extremist groups had infiltrated police brutality protests across the country and deliberately tipped largely peaceful demonstrations toward violence — and if foreign adversaries were behind a burgeoning disinformation campaign on social media. As demonstrations spread from Minneapolis to the White House, New York City and overseas Sunday, federal law enforcement officials insisted far-left groups were stoking violence. Meanwhile, experts who track extremist groups also reported seeing evidence of the far-right at work. Investigators were also tracking online interference and looking into whether foreign agents were behind the effort. Officials have seen a surge of social media accounts with fewer than 200 followers created in the last month, a textbook sign of a disinformation effort. The accounts have posted graphic images of the protests, material on police brutality and material on the coronavirus pandemic that appeared designed to inflame tensions across the political divide, according to three administration officials. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss investigations. The investigations are an attempt to identify the network of forces behind some of the most widespread outbreaks of civil unrest in the U.S. in decades. Protests erupted in dozens of cities in recent days, triggered by the death of George Floyd, who died after he was pinned at the neck by a white Minneapolis police officer's knee. Pandemic-weary Americans were already angry — about COVID-19 deaths, lockdown orders and tens of millions of people out of work. The pandemic has hit African Americans harder than whites in the U.S., and the killings of black people by police have continued over the years even as the topic faded from the national stage. But there are signs of people with other disparate motives, including anarchist graffiti, arrests of some out-of-state protesters, and images circulating in extremist groups that suggest the involvement of outside groups. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said Sunday that state authorities were hit with a cyber attack as law enforcement prepared to diffuse protests in Minneapolis and St. Paul, the epicenter of the unrest. He described it as a ""very sophisticated denial of service attack on all computers."" President Donald Trump, Attorney General William Bar and others have said the left-wing extremist group antifa is to blame. Short for anti-fascists, antifa is an umbrella term for far-left-leaning militant groups that resist neo-Nazis and white supremacists at demonstrations. Barr on Sunday said the FBI would use its regional joint terrorism task forces to ""identify criminal organizers,"" and Trump threatened again to name antifa a terrorist group. The Justice Department is also deploying members of the U.S. Marshals Service and agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration on Sunday to supplement National Guard troops outside the White House, a senior department official said. The official was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. The addition of the federal agents, who will have armored vehicles, came as Barr warned that prosecutors could seek to use terrorism statutes against ""violent radical agitators"" who attempt to hijack protests to cause destruction. An antifa activist group disseminated a message in a Telegram channel on Saturday that encouraged people to consider Minnesota National Guard troops ""easy targets,"" two Defense Department officials said. The message encouraged activists to steal ""kit,"" meaning the weapons and body armor used by the soldiers. The officials were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. As a result, soldiers with the Minnesota National Guard were armed during their mission at protests across the state Sunday, the officials said. The soldiers are sometimes armed but had not been since they moved into parts of the state that had been besieged by riots in the last few days. The troops do not have the authority to make arrests, and are there to act mostly as extra security for police. Others have seen evidence of right-wing extremists. J.J. MacNab, a fellow at George Washington University's Program on Extremism, has been monitoring chatter about the protests among anti-government extremists on social media platforms. She has access to dozens of private Facebook groups for followers of the loosely organized ""Boogaloo"" movement, which uses an '80s movie sequel as a code word for a second civil war. She also has been poring over images from the weekend protests and spotted some ""boogaloo bois"" in the crowds, carrying high-powered rifles and wearing tactical gear. ""They want to co-opt them in order to start their war. They see themselves as being on the side of protesters and that the protesters themselves are useful in causing anarchy,"" MacNab said. She also sees signs that the Three Percenters militia movement appears to be taking an interest. Megan Squire, an Elon University computer science professor who tracks online extremism, saw images of at least four members of the far-right Proud Boys group on the periphery of a protest Saturday night in Raleigh, North Carolina. Trump was expected in the coming days to draw distinctions between the legitimate anger of peaceful protesters and the unacceptable actions of violent agitators, said a White House official who was not authorized to discuss the plans ahead of time and spoke on condition of anonymity. The Trump administration has largely remained silent on local reports that far-right protesters were also involved. Meanwhile, Democratic mayors said Trump's handling of the crisis was reminiscent of one of the darkest moments of his presidency — when he said there were ""good people on both sides"" of protests in 2017 over white supremacists demonstrating in Charlottesville, Virginia. America's racial fault lines are a perfect opportunity for foreign adversaries looking to sow discord and portray the U.S. in a negative light, according to James Ludes, director of the Pell Center for International Relations and Public Policy at Salve Regina University in Rhode Island. ""This is a real issue and Americans are legitimately upset about it,"" said Ludes, who studies foreign disinformation tactics. ""That's one of the hallmarks of these campaigns. You don't create new issues, you exploit existing issues."" There's a history of this. In 2016, another black man, Philando Castile, was killed by police in a Minneapolis suburb, his death livestreamed on Facebook. Russians used a fake Black Lives Matter page to confuse and stoke anger among the protesters. There were nearly 700,000 followers, but it's not clear how many were real. One debunked example from this week: That Atlanta had deployed a ""child militia."" Floyd was accused of trying to pass a bad bill at a grocery store after he was laid off in the pandemic. Disturbing video showed him prone on the street, while a white police officer pressed his knee into Floyd's neck even as he cried he couldn't breathe. He later died. The officers have been fired; Derek Chauvin, the officer who pinned Floyd in the video, was charged with murder. At first there were peaceful demonstrations, but violence soon erupted. A Minneapolis police station was torched and protests took off around the country, growing increasingly tense. Video showed a police vehicle ramming into demonstrators in New York. Meanwhile, a van with four New York Police Department officers inside was hit with a Molotov cocktail and torched. Hundreds have been arrested nationwide and cities braced for more protests. But booking information from the county jail in Minneapolis, for example, showed that out of 59 protest-related arrests, 47 people had a home address in Minnesota, with the majority coming from the Twin Cities. Before protests began in New York City, organizers of anarchist groups began raising money for bail, recruited medical teams to deploy for violent interactions with police and planned how to target high-end stores, said John Miller, the NYPD's deputy commissioner of intelligence and counterterrorism. Scouts on bicycles would also move ahead of the groups to report where the police would be and then direct small breakaway groups to areas where they could torch police cars or throw Molotov cocktails, Miller said. The NYPD has arrested 786 people related to protests since May 28 and 1 in 7 of them were not from New York City, he said. In Washington, where protesters raged outside the White House, most of the 17 people arrested were from the area. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser said the groups seemed, at the least, organized to destroy with tools to break windows and distribute materials. ___ Associated Press writers Kathleen Hennessey in Minneapolis; Michael Kunzelman in Silver Spring, Md.; Michael R.

Gov. Gina Raimondo early Tuesday afternoon activated the Rhode Island National Guard to help police protect property and quell further unrest. Backed by Mayor Jorge Elorza and top law-enforcement officials, Raimondo characterized the chaos that began at the Providence Place Mall late Monday night not as a political protest but a violent attack. ""What we saw last night was an organized attack on our community at a time we are already vulnerable,"" Raimondo told reporters in a midday news conference in front of the shuttered mall. ""They weren't even pretending to protest,"" she added later. ""They showed up in the middle of the night, angry, with crowbars and flares and buckets of gasoline with one purpose: to set our city on fire and hurt people."" Fearful of more clashes, Elorza, Cranston Mayor Allan Fung, Warwick Mayor Joseph Solomon and Central Falls Mayor James Diossa ordered curfews starting Tuesday night in their respective cities. Providence’s curfew — which lasts until June 9 — runs from 9 p.m. to 6 a.m. Cranston and Warwick curfews run from 8 p.m. to 5 a.m. and expire Wednesday, as does the Central Falls curfew, which starts at 8:30 p.m. All four curfews have a mix of exemptions for essential workers and for travel to and from work, medical treatment or necessary activities. The ACLU of Rhode Island said the ""overly broad"" curfews could lead to new discrimination. The curfews in Cranston and Warwick came after Garden City Center closed early due to threats of looting against that shopping center and the Warwick Mall posted on social media. By 5 p.m. Garden City was surrounded by police. The night of chaos late Monday and early Tuesday turned the pride Raimondo had felt about the weekend’s peaceful Providence protests over the death of George Floyd in Minnesota into disheartened anger. The tumultuous morning fell in line with a pattern many cities have seen in recent days of peaceful protests by day and destructive riots after dark. The peaceful protest on Saturday, organized by Black Lives Matter Rhode Island, drew about 2,000 people to the State House and concluded with no arrests. But on Tuesday, Elorza said, 65 people were arrested, 35 of them from the city and five from out of state; the rest were from other cities or towns in Rhode Island. Providence police surrounded the mall and State House on Monday evening as word of a gathering there spread through social media. By 11 p.m. a chanting crowd had gathered in front of officers, and by midnight up to 300 people were aggressively confronting police on Francis Street, said Providence Public Safety Commissioner Steven Paré. Around 60 Providence police were eventually joined by officers from a handful of other communities, another 60 Rhode Island State Police troopers and 15 Massachusetts State Police troopers. Massachusetts State Police also brought a helicopter. People in the crowd threw objects, including bricks, and set a police cruiser on fire, sending a giant, swirling plume of black smoke into the air. At one point Tuesday morning, a woman held up her cellphone to a line of Providence police officers and asked them one by one, ""Would you have intervened in George Floyd’s death?"" The situation in front of the mall grew more tense as the crowd pushed in closer to the building and officers tried to force them back. Officers handcuffed some people and fired what appeared to be tear gas canisters into the crowd. The crowd eventually overran police lines, Paré said, and around 100 people broke into the mall, where shop windows were smashed and more than a dozen stores looted. Police SWAT teams eventually chased some of the people back out onto the street, where they spread into downtown. Rhode Island State Police Supt. Col. James Manni told reporters at the news conference that the people who confronted officers wanted to destroy the mall and the State House. ""They saved these buildings,"" Manni said, commending Providence police. ""They were the tip of the spear before we got here. They stood toe-to-toe right here and prevented people from burning this place to the ground and burning [the State House] to the ground, which was their intention."" Manni said the gathering was organized by an ""anti-government"" group of ""anarchists"" with a left-leaning mindset similar to Antifa. He declined to say whether the group had a name but said ""they have an ideology,"" which he said was centered around ""destruction."" The actions early Tuesday morning were not organized by Black Lives Matter Rhode Island. A flier of unknown origin reading ""Providence Looting 12:00 AM Tonight! (Expletive) The Police"" had circulated on social media the previous day. Those arrested early Tuesday morning were arraigned by the afternoon. Many were teenagers. Several Providence police officers and state troopers were hit by bricks, according to Manni. Paré said Tuesday morning that four to five Providence officers and four to five state troopers were injured; some were treated and released from hospitals, others ""weren’t even treated,"" he said. With police SWAT teams and dogs in the mall, many of those who had been on Francis Street swept into downtown and into other neighborhoods, smashing dozens of windows, looting some stores and breaking into cars. The William E. Powers building, which houses the state Department of Administration, was among the buildings damaged. The building, located across from the Rhode Island State House, was closed on Tuesday morning. Rioters broke windows and ransacked the bar at Cafe Nuovo, a restaurant at One Citizens Plaza. Providence City Hall, the offices of Rhode Island Housing and the Hotel Providence also had windows broken. Asked whether the state had been caught unprepared or whether she should have mobilized the National Guard sooner, Raimondo said she didn’t think so. ""It was not a surprise,"" she said. ""We were not caught off-guard. We arrested nearly 70 people and it would have been much much worse if we had not been as prepared and acted professionally."" – With reports from Journal Staff Writer Tom Mooney mlist@providencejournal.com (401) 277-7121 On Twitter: @madeleine_list",0.0

Gina Raimondo said Tuesday morning that people who committed acts of violence and other crimes overnight in Providence “will be held accountable.“ “What happened in Providence last night was unacceptable. It was criminal. It put lives at risk,” Raimondo said in a statement. Chaos broke out in the city following a protest over the death in Minneapolis of George Floyd, a 46-year-old black man. Video showed a Minneapolis police officer, Derek Chauvin, pressing his knee down onto Floyd’s neck for close to nine minutes. Protests have been held across the nation and other countries. In Providence early Tuesday, 65 people were arrested; 8 to 10 police officers and state troopers were injured, some struck with bricks. A large group broke into Providence Place mall, a police cruiser was burned and many businesses were damaged, with people breaking into some and stealing. Raimondo said, “We are at a critical moment in American history, and our actions today can set the course for a more just and equal society tomorrow. But if we let violence give rise to more violence, then that opportunity will be lost. “To those in Rhode Island and around the country who are expressing your outrage and pain through peaceful protest: I hear you. Let’s rise above the hate, rise above the fear, and work to root out racism on an individual and institutional level.” Raimondo was scheduled to address the press at 11:30. Earlier Tuesday, Providence Mayor Jorge Elorza said he planned to discuss with Raimondo further steps to protect the city, including the possibility of a curfew. jperry@providencejournal.com (401) 277-7614 On Twitter: @jgregoryperry",0.0

WASHINGTON — American cities erupted in violence and destruction in a seventh straight night of unrest, with several police officers shot or run over, amid boasts and threats from President Donald Trump to send in troops to ""dominate the streets."" In New York, nonviolent protests Monday night were punctuated by people smashing shop windows near Rockefeller Center and breaching the doors of Macy's flagship store on 34th Street, littering the pavement with broken glass. An SUV plowed into a group of officers at a demonstration in Buffalo, injuring three, including a state trooper who suffered a broken leg and a shattered pelvis. Demonstrations also broke out in such places as Philadelphia, where hundreds of protesters spilled onto a highway in the heart of the city; Atlanta, where police fired tear gas at demonstrators; and Nashville, where more than 60 National Guard members put down their riot shields at the request of peaceful protesters who had gathered in front of Tennessee's Capitol to honor George Floyd. Bystander Sean Jones, who watched as people ransacked luxury stores in New York over the weekend, said: ""People are doing this so next time, before they think about trying to kill another black person, they're going to be like, 'Damn, we don't want them out here doing this ... again.'"" The unrest in Minneapolis appeared to stabilize on the same day Floyd's brother made an impassioned plea for peace at the spot where a white police officer, Derek Chauvin, put his knee on the handcuffed black man's neck until he stopped breathing last week. Chauvin has been charged with murder. Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said Tuesday that prosecutors were working as fast as they can to determine if the three other officers at the scene should be charged, too. All four have been fired. The death toll from the unrest rose to at least nine, including two people killed in a Chicago suburb. More than 5,600 people nationwide have been arrested over the past week for such offenses as stealing, blocking highways and breaking curfew, according to a count by The Associated Press. Cities struggled to keep police in line and avoid instances of excessive force. The police chief in Louisville, Kentucky, was fired after a beloved restaurant owner was killed by police and National Guard members enforcing a curfew. In Richmond, Virginia, the police chief said officers who used tear gas on a group of peaceful protesters would be disciplined. An officer was shot shortly before midnight near the Circus Circus casino in Las Vegas. Police had no immediate word on the officer's condition. Four officers were shot in St. Louis; they were expected to recover. Trump, meanwhile, portrayed himself as a hard-nosed, law-and-order president, with police under federal command using tear gas to clear peaceful demonstrators from a park near the White House so that he could walk to a church and pose with a Bible. Emerging after two days out of public view, he threatened from the White House Rose Garden to deploy ""thousands and thousands"" of U.S. troops. The photo op at the house of worship known as the Church of the Presidents was condemned by Episcopal Bishop Mariann Edgar Budde. ""The president just used a Bible and one of the churches of my diocese as a backdrop for a message antithetical to the teachings of Jesus and everything that our church stands for,"" she said. A senior White House official said Tuesday that despite Trump's threats, the goal was to pressure governors to deploy National Guard units. The president was not rushing to use the Insurrection Act to send in the military, according to the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. For nearly a week since Floyd's death, largely peaceful protests by day have turned to chaos at night. ""We have been sitting on a powder keg for some time and it has burst,"" Philadelphia Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw said. Trump warned that if governors don't deploy the National Guard in sufficient numbers to ""dominate the streets,"" the U.S. military will step in to ""quickly solve the problem for them."" ""We have the greatest country in the world,"" the president declared. ""We're going to keep it safe."" As Trump spoke, tear gas canisters could be heard exploding. A military deployment by Trump to U.S. states would mark a stunning federal intervention rarely seen in modern American history. It drew comparisons to 1968, when Richard Nixon ran as the law-and-order candidate in the aftermath of riots following the assassination of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. Trump made little effort to address the grievances of black Americans and others outraged by Floyd's death and the scourge of police brutality, undermining what his reelection campaign had hoped would be increased appeal to African American voters. Federal law allows presidents to dispatch the military into states to suppress an insurrection or if a state is defying federal law, legal experts said. But officials in New York and other states asserted that the president does not have a unilateral right to send in troops against the will of local governments.",0.0

U.S. stock indexes are moving higher in early trading Tuesday, following broad gains in global markets as investors hope that the gradual lifting of coronavirus lockdown mandates will put economies ravaged by the outbreak on the path to recovery. The S&P 500 was up 0.4%, adding to gains from the day before. Financial, industrial and other stocks that would stand to benefit the most from a growing economy moved higher. Energy companies also rose as the price of crude oil headed higher. Bond yields were mostly higher, another sign of ebbing pessimism among investors. The modest gains have the S&P 500 on track for a three-day winning streak, extending the benchmark index's remarkable two-month rally off a steep skid in February and March as broad swaths of the U.S. economy ground to a halt due to the coronavirus pandemic. So far, Wall Street's momentum has not been derailed by the wave of daily unrest across the U.S. that began last week in Minneapolis as a protest over police brutality. Cities across the country have been rocked by violence and destruction for seven days in a row, spurring threats from the White House to send troops in to put down the unrest. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 189 points, or 0.7%, to 25,668. The Nasdaq composite was up 0.2%. Smaller company stocks had some of the biggest gains in the early going. The Russell 2000 index was up 0.8%. NASA astronauts launched into space by SpaceX on Saturday rang the opening bell from the International Space Station early Tuesday to kick off trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Stocks have now recouped most of their losses after the initial economic fallout from the coronavirus knocked the market into a breathtaking 34% skid in February and March. The S&P 500 is now down just under 10% from its all-time high in February. Investors are hoping that the worst of the recession has already passed, or will soon, as governments around the country and around the world slowly lift restrictions meant to corral the outbreak. In Europe, France's CAC 40 jumped 2.1% Tuesday as the country opened restaurants, cafes, parks and beaches and launched a contract tracing app to help keep tabs on new contagions. Germany's DAX, which had been closed Monday, caught up with previous global markets' gains and surged 3.7%. Britain's FTSE 100 added 0.9%. Markets in Asia closed broadly higher. While more countries and sectors are reopening, activity is expected to remain subdued as social distancing rules complicate plans to get back to business. And fears persist about a possible resurgence in coronavirus outbreaks in some countries.

Gina Raimondo says she has activated the National Guard to support the state police and local police, in response to damage and looting in downtown Providence last night. ""Additionally I am continuing to evaluate all options available at our disposal to protect the people of Rhode Island and we are closely monitoring using all of our public safety resources throughout the day today,"" Raimondo said. Later in the day, Providence Mayor Jorge Elorza announced a 9 p.m. curfew for Providence. Cranston was under an 8 p.m. curfew. ""Everything is on the table,"" Elorza told reporters at a morning news conference. He said he planned to consult with Raimondo to decide the best course of action. With the sound of smashed windows being boarded up in the background, Elorza said those who gathered around 11 o’clock Monday night in front of the Providence Place mall were not there to protest the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minnesota police, but to ""cause trouble."" ""We need to come together,"" Elorza said of the unrest that has swept the country. ""This is not the way."" Between 200 and 300 people gathered in front of the mall Monday night trying after it had closed and confronted police, shouting at them and throwing bricks, Public Safety Commissioner Steven Pare said. Eventually police were overrun and 75 to 100 people got inside the building, damaging stores and looting. Police then entered the mall and forced those who had entered back out onto Francis Street. The group then moved through downtown smashing store windows. Sixty-five people were arrested Monday night, Elorza said, 35 of them Providence residents. Up to five police officers suffered minor injuries. One Providence police cruiser was set on fire and four others damaged.

Sheldon Whitehouse criticized President Donald Trump in the wake of violence and vandalism overnight in Providence following the protest over the death of a black man in police custody in Minnesota. “President Trump is fanning the flames of division at a moment when so many Americans are suffering,” Whitehouse said in a statement. “But, true to our state’s founding principles of hope and tolerance, Rhode Islanders will reject efforts to divide us. Progress is made peacefully.” Sixty-five people were arrested in Providence early Tuesday, and eight to 10 police officers injured, some struck with bricks. A large crowd broke into Providence Place mall, a police cruiser was burned and many downtown businesses were damaged. The chaos spilled from a protest over the death in Minnesota of George Floyd, a 46-year-old black man. Video showed a Minneapolis police officer, Derek Chauvin, with his knee pressed against Floyd’s neck for close to nine minutes. Chauvin has since been fired and charged with murder. The death has sparked protests across the country and in other parts of the world. Whitehouse said, “I am heartsick to see the destruction of small businesses in downtown Providence and attacks on police officers working to contain a dangerous situation. Nobody has a right to inflict violence, which only serves to drown out the message of lawful protestors. We must hold the people who organized this riot accountable and help rebuild what was broken.” jperry@providencejournal.com (401) 277-7614 On Twitter: @jgregoryperry",0.0

On Sunday night, the twins held a round-table discussion of the issues on their Double Coverage Podcast. For almost an hour and 15 minutes, the McCourtys interviewed multiple people who are actively trying to bring change. They also answered questions and discussed their own feelings on the ongoing racial problems in this country. ""Me and Dev just thought, with everything going on in the country, we’d spend some time just to talk about it,"" Jason McCourty said in the podcast. ""Sports is obviously something that plays a huge role in our loves, but right now sports doesn’t seem like something that is very important. There’s a lot of things going on in our country, from the pandemic to the racial issues that have gone on and plagued our country for hundreds and hundreds of years. We just wanted to open up our platform and be able to discuss some of these things."" This isn’t out of the ordinary for the McCourty twins. The brothers have dedicated their lives to the cause of social justice. Their work in the community led to a nomination for the 2020 Muhammad Ali Sports Humanitarian Award, which is given to athletes who have created positive impacts in their communities through sports. Last year, the McCourtys, along with teammates Matthew Slater and Duron Harmon, fought to get an education bill passed in Massachusetts. In October, the Massachusetts House of Representatives and Senate unanimously passed the Student Opportunity Act. The bill will invest $1.5 billion into the state’s public education school system. ""That’s part of it,"" Jason McCourty said. ""When you can attack legislation and get laws and the system changed, that’s going to bring a real impact. But we can’t expect that to happen over night. It’s been hundreds of years in the process of being made the way it is."" It wasn’t long ago that peaceful protests were seen in the NFL. Started by quarterback Colin Kaepernick, players knelt during the National Anthem to bring awareness to social injustice. In 2017, following disparaging comments and tweets from President Donald Trump, several Patriots players knelt during the anthem before a game against the Houston Texans. The players were booed in Gillette Stadium by people who disagreed with the action, saying they were disrespecting the military and the country. On Sunday, Devin McCourty talked about Kaepernick in light of the Floyd death, a black man who died when Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin knelt on his neck for 8 minutes and 46 seconds. ""Look at Kaepernick. A couple of years ago, people were going crazy. ‘This guy is this, he’s that,’ "" Devin McCourty said. ""Then, the irony of a man losing his life because a knee is on his neck and now, all of a sudden, people are like, oh man, let me take an extra second to listen to what Kaepernick said in an interview about why he took a knee and why he did a silent protest. ""When you listen to it, it’s like oh, that’s kind of how I feel right now after watching that video. It’s like, if you ever stopped and listened to what he was doing and his true message, it would have never got to that point and you would have never talked about the military, you would have never talked about the flag. You would’ve understood he was talking about freedom."" The brothers also talked with their former Rutgers teammate Chris Quaye, who is a private banker at Morgan Stanley. He talked about being an African American in a workplace where he is the overwhelming minority. Quaye, who is a part of his company’s diversity council, aims to help open doors for other minorities looking to get into the industry by educating youth. The McCourty twins spoke with former Rutgers linebacker Antonio Lowery, who is an African American police officer in Miami. He spoke about how he was taught that police officers were ""bad"" and ""dangerous"" while growing up. Lowery says he wants to ""change the narrative"" and he takes time to mentor kids. The brothers also spoke with Pat Brown, a former Rutgers wide receiver who is the football coach at Seabreeze High School in Daytona Beach, Florida. He spoke about trying to bring student-athletes together who come from different backgrounds because of race and family wealth. The McCourty twins also discussed how people can invest in their community to make a difference and how a simple talk with someone can go a long way. ""We have to take advantage of the platform we have while we have it,"" said Jason McCourty. ""Once you retire, you can do it but it’s almost too late to demand the audience the people that you have. It just starts with a conversation."" mdaniels@providencejournal.com On Twitter: @MarkDanielsPJ",0.0

WASHINGTON — American cities erupted in violence and destruction in a seventh straight night of unrest, with several police officers shot or run over, amid boasts and threats from President Donald Trump to send in troops to ""dominate the streets."" In New York, nonviolent protests Monday night were punctuated by people smashing shop windows near Rockefeller Center and breaching the doors of Macy's flagship store on 34th Street, littering the pavement with broken glass. An SUV plowed into a group of officers at a demonstration in Buffalo, injuring three, including a state trooper who suffered a broken leg and a shattered pelvis. Demonstrations also broke out in such places as Philadelphia, where hundreds of protesters spilled onto a highway in the heart of the city; Atlanta, where police fired tear gas at demonstrators; and Nashville, where more than 60 National Guard members put down their riot shields at the request of peaceful protesters who had gathered in front of Tennessee's Capitol to honor George Floyd. Bystander Sean Jones, who watched as people ransacked luxury stores in New York over the weekend, said: ""People are doing this so next time, before they think about trying to kill another black person, they're going to be like, 'Damn, we don't want them out here doing this ... again.'"" The unrest in Minneapolis appeared to stabilize on the same day Floyd's brother made an impassioned plea for peace at the spot where a white police officer, Derek Chauvin, put his knee on the handcuffed black man's neck until he stopped breathing last week. Chauvin has been charged with murder. Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said Tuesday that prosecutors were working as fast as they can to determine if the three other officers at the scene should be charged, too. All four have been fired. The death toll from the unrest rose to at least nine, including two people killed in a Chicago suburb. More than 5,600 people nationwide have been arrested over the past week for such offenses as stealing, blocking highways and breaking curfew, according to a count by The Associated Press. Cities struggled to keep police in line and avoid instances of excessive force. The police chief in Louisville, Kentucky, was fired after a beloved restaurant owner was killed by police and National Guard members enforcing a curfew. In Richmond, Virginia, the police chief said officers who used tear gas on a group of peaceful protesters would be disciplined. An officer was shot shortly before midnight near the Circus Circus casino in Las Vegas. Police had no immediate word on the officer's condition. Four officers were shot in St. Louis; they were expected to recover. Trump, meanwhile, portrayed himself as a hard-nosed, law-and-order president, with police under federal command using tear gas to clear peaceful demonstrators from a park near the White House so that he could walk to a church and pose with a Bible. Emerging after two days out of public view, he threatened from the White House Rose Garden to deploy ""thousands and thousands"" of U.S. troops. The photo op at the house of worship known as the Church of the Presidents was condemned by Episcopal Bishop Mariann Edgar Budde. ""The president just used a Bible and one of the churches of my diocese as a backdrop for a message antithetical to the teachings of Jesus and everything that our church stands for,"" she said. A senior White House official said Tuesday that despite Trump's threats, the goal was to pressure governors to deploy National Guard units. The president was not rushing to use the Insurrection Act to send in the military, according to the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. For nearly a week since Floyd's death, largely peaceful protests by day have turned to chaos at night. ""We have been sitting on a powder keg for some time and it has burst,"" Philadelphia Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw said. Trump warned that if governors don't deploy the National Guard in sufficient numbers to ""dominate the streets,"" the U.S. military will step in to ""quickly solve the problem for them."" ""We have the greatest country in the world,"" the president declared. ""We're going to keep it safe."" As Trump spoke, tear gas canisters could be heard exploding. A military deployment by Trump to U.S. states would mark a stunning federal intervention rarely seen in modern American history. It drew comparisons to 1968, when Richard Nixon ran as the law-and-order candidate in the aftermath of riots following the assassination of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. Trump made little effort to address the grievances of black Americans and others outraged by Floyd's death and the scourge of police brutality, undermining what his reelection campaign had hoped would be increased appeal to African American voters. Federal law allows presidents to dispatch the military into states to suppress an insurrection or if a state is defying federal law, legal experts said. But officials in New York and other states asserted that the president does not have a unilateral right to send in troops against the will of local governments.",0.0

BIRMINGHAM, Ala. — The base of a massive Confederate monument in Alabama's largest city was all that remained Tuesday after crews dismantled the towering obelisk and trucked it away in pieces. Other symbols came down elsewhere, leaving an empty pedestal and a bare flagpole. Workers hired by the city of Birmingham began removing the top portion of the 115-year-old monument from Linn Park late Monday. By daybreak, the pedestal was the only thing left, covered with graffiti and pock marks from protests against police brutality. Sarah Collins Rudolph, whose sister Addie Mae Collins died in a racist church bombing that killed three other black girls in the city in 1963, came to see the remains. She lowered a protective face mask to take in the sight. ""I'm glad it's been removed because it has been so long. It's a hate monument,"" said Rudolph. She was seriously injured in the blast at 16th Street Baptist Church, and testified against Ku Klux Klansmen who were convicted in the killings. Confederate symbols across the South have been targeted for vandalism during demonstrations sparked by the death in police custody of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Now even some of their longtime defenders have decided to remove them. In Alexandria, Virginia, it was the United Daughters of the Confederacy that took action early Tuesday, removing the statue of a soldier gazing south from Old Town since 1889. And outside Tampa, Florida, a Sons of Confederate Veterans chapter lowered a huge Confederate battle flag that has long been flown in view of two interstate highways. Birmingham finally took action about a day after protesters tried to remove the monument themselves, during one of the many nationwide protests sparked by the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody. Live video from overnight showed a flatbed truck hauling off the stone pieces in the early morning hours. It's unclear where they were being taken. Crews were expected to return later Tuesday to finish the job, a city official said. The monument had been the subject of a protracted court battle between the city and state. Alabama authorities said Birmingham would face a $25,000 assessment for violating a state law that bans the removal of such monuments. Mayor Randall Woodfin said the fine would be much more affordable than the cost of continued unrest in the city. Work to remove the monument began on Monday, which happened to be Alabama's holiday honoring Confederate President Jefferson Davis, who was sworn in on the steps of the state Capitol in Montgomery. There, on the same day, someone knocked over a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee outside a mostly black high school named for him, news outlets reported. In Alexandria, a city spokesman said the United Daughters of the Confederacy informed the city on Monday that it would remove the statue, and the city's only role was to provide traffic support. By morning, the pedestal was all that was left. City officials were not told where the statue was taken. Titled ""Appomattox,"" it depicts a solitary Confederate soldier, his head bowed slightly. In 1890, a state law was passed barring local officials from ever removing it. That law was repealed earlier this year. Alexandria Mayor Justin Wilson tweeted photos of the removal on Tuesday, saying ""Alexandria, like all great cities, is constantly changing and evolving.""",0.0

Now even some of their longtime defenders have decided to remove them. In Alexandria, Virginia, it was the United Daughters of the Confederacy that took action early Tuesday, removing the statue of a soldier gazing south from Old Town since 1889. And outside Tampa, Florida, a Sons of Confederate Veterans chapter lowered a huge Confederate battle flag that has long been flown in view of two interstate highways. Birmingham finally took action about a day after protesters tried to remove the monument themselves, during one of the many nationwide protests sparked by the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody. Live video from overnight showed a flatbed truck hauling off the stone pieces in the early morning hours. It's unclear where they were being taken. Crews were expected to return later Tuesday to finish the job, a city official said. The monument had been the subject of a protracted court battle between the city and state. Alabama authorities said Birmingham would face a $25,000 assessment for violating a state law that bans the removal of such monuments. Mayor Randall Woodfin said the fine would be much more affordable than the cost of continued unrest in the city. Work to remove the monument began on Monday, which happened to be Alabama's holiday honoring Confederate President Jefferson Davis, who was sworn in on the steps of the state Capitol in Montgomery. There, on the same day, someone knocked over a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee outside a mostly black high school named for him, news outlets reported. In Alexandria, a city spokesman said the United Daughters of the Confederacy informed the city on Monday that it would remove the statue, and the city's only role was to provide traffic support. By morning, the pedestal was all that was left. City officials were not told where the statue was taken. Titled ""Appomattox,"" it depicts a solitary Confederate soldier, his head bowed slightly. In 1890, a state law was passed barring local officials from ever removing it. That law was repealed earlier this year. Alexandria Mayor Justin Wilson tweeted photos of the removal on Tuesday, saying ""Alexandria, like all great cities, is constantly changing and evolving.""",0.0

The owner of Civil, which also has locations in East Greenwich and Westerly, took some cash from the register and retrieved his personal skateboard deck collection that lined the wall. Then he went home, and crossed his fingers. Fast forward to shortly before 2 a.m., and Silvestri got the call from his security company, reporting the glass storefront windows were smashed in. For the next several hours, he sat up, awake and anxious, as a friend who lived downtown texted him updates of crowds vandalizing the store and stealing clothes, boards and sneakers. “It was gut-wrenching,” said Silvestri of his long, sleepless night. “Your stomach is doing backflips all night.” - Advertisement - Unlike a peaceful demonstration over the weekend, violent overnight protests left stores across downtown and in the Providence Place mall ransacked. Roughly 65 people were arrested, as city and state police worked overnight to quell the riots, Providence Mayor Jorge Elorza said on Tuesday. Gov. Gina M. Raimondo on Tuesday condemned the rioting, calling it “an attack on the people of Rhode Island” and not a protest. “They came here deliberately to cause harm, hurt people and destroy our property,” she said. Seventy individuals were arrested as a result, the majority of them are Rhode Islanders – and about half from Providence. “[They were] going after small businesses at a time when many of them are just barely getting back on their feet,” Raimondo said. “What they did was wrong. I’m ashamed and angry. But most of all, I’m determined to hold them accountable.” After receiving the go-ahead from law enforcement, Silvestri raced from his Saunderstown home to downtown. It was 7 a.m,, light and eerily quiet, when he arrived at his store and caught his first glimpses of the destruction. The windows were broken, the TV and front desk computer smashed, stray clothing and single sneakers strewn across the floor. Silvestri estimated the losses at upwards of $10,000, though he was hesitant to give a more specific number. “At this point, it’s still tough to wrap my head around, he said. “I kind of don’t even know where to start.” His voice faltered as he looked around the store, the floors cleaned, a plywood board covering the broken window and the roar of a vacuum as an employee removed the last shards of glass by mid-morning Tuesday. He had weathered a pandemic, and was beginning to resume business as usual, having reopened the store under state guidelines in mid-May. Even during the shutdown, Silvestri worked hard to keep things running, securing a federal loan through the U.S. Small Business Administration’s Paycheck Protection Program to keep his employees on staff, transitioning all merchandise to the store’s online shop and offering deals like free in-state shipping to incentivize customers. “It was working,” he said. “We were doing OK.” Cafe Nuovo had not fared as well. The downtown restaurant overlooking the Providence river had shuttered during stay-at-home orders, not even offering takeout or delivery, said Sean Scannell, general manager. He was banking on the success of indoor dining, having just resumed on Monday after opening the outdoor seating area a few weeks prior. When he came back at 7 a.m. Tuesday, the tables were turned over, alcohol bottles strewn across the floor and most of the outdoor dining furniture dumped in the river. “It’s hard to see this happening in our own backyard, not just something you read about on the internet,” Scannell said. On Tuesday morning, wait staff in white shirts and black pants joined with volunteers in cleaning the wreck, bringing remaining patio furniture inside as the restaurant prepared to close once again. For how long, Scannell was unsure. “We don’t feel like it’s safe to open right now,” he said, noting that more protests have been planned for the week. And the consequences for downtown Providence businesses could last even longer, said Joseph Paolino Jr., owner of Paolino Properties, which owns several downtown buildings. While the damage to his properties was repairable – mostly smashed windows – Paolino worried about his small-business tenants already suffering from the blow of the pandemic and desperately trying to resume some semblance of normalcy. “Every time you take a step forward, you take two steps back,” he said. The violent images of a police car burning in downtown Providence were hard to erase from his mind, and he worried what potential customers would think. “It doesn’t make Providence an inviting place to visit,” he said. ENO Fine Wines on Westminster Street, meanwhile, opened at its regular 11 a.m. Tuesday despite the damage. The smashed glass window had been covered with plywood, and workers and volunteers continued to sweep up shattered glass and spilled alcohol. As he knelt outside the liquor store, vacuuming up shards of glass from between the cobblestones of the sidewalk, store clerk Domenic Merolla said the store fared better than some in terms of the extent of the damage. And as an “essential business” able to remain open during the pandemic, sales had not plummeted the way they had at neighboring shops. Still, he worried about additional damage from future rioting. “All we can do is be more prepared,” he said. Silvestri was reluctant to begin repairing and restocking his shell of a store because of fear over more riots. “I want to go slow,” he said. “I don’t want to invest all of that only to have it be destroyed again.” (ADDS paragraphs 6-8 with comment from Raimondo.)

BIRMINGHAM, Ala. — The base of a massive Confederate monument in Alabama's largest city was all that remained Tuesday after crews dismantled the towering obelisk and trucked it away in pieces. Other symbols came down elsewhere, leaving an empty pedestal and a bare flagpole. Workers hired by the city of Birmingham began removing the top portion of the 115-year-old monument from Linn Park late Monday. By daybreak, the pedestal was the only thing left, covered with graffiti and pock marks from protests against police brutality. Sarah Collins Rudolph, whose sister Addie Mae Collins died in a racist church bombing that killed three other black girls in the city in 1963, came to see the remains. She lowered a protective face mask to take in the sight. ""I'm glad it's been removed because it has been so long. It's a hate monument,"" said Rudolph.

PARIS — Thousands of French protesters defied a virus-related police ban and rallied Tuesday against racial injustice and heavy-handed police tactics, as global outrage over what happened to George Floyd in the United States kindled frustrations across borders and continents. Clapping, cheering and waving signs reading ""Black Lives Matter"" and ""Police Everywhere, Justice Nowhere,"" the largely young, multiracial crowd streamed to the main Paris courthouse and rallied peacefully while police monitored closely from nearby corners. Earlier, thousands marched in Sydney, Australia's largest city, chanting ""I can't breathe,"" and expressions of anger erupted in multiple languages on social networks, with thousands of Swedes joining an online protest and others speaking out under the banner of #BlackOutTuesday. Diplomatic ire percolated too, with the European Union's top foreign policy official saying the bloc was ""shocked and appalled"" by Floyd's death. As protests escalated worldwide, solidarity with U.S. demonstrators increasingly mixed with local worries. ""When you refuse to treat the problem of racism ... it leads to what we see in the United States,"" said Dominique Sopo, head of French activist group SOS Racisme. ""The case of George Floyd echoes what we fear in France."" Floyd died last week after a police officer pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes even after he stopped moving and pleading for air. The death set off protests that spread across America -- and now, beyond. Fears of the coronavirus remain close to the surface and were the reason cited by the police for banning Tuesday's protest at the main Paris courthouse. Gatherings of more than 10 people remain banned in France as part of virus confinement measures. But the Paris protest plans drew attention online, and demonstrators showed up anyway. Similar demonstrations were held in other French cities in honor of Adama Traore, who died shortly after his arrest in 2016, and in solidarity with Americans demonstrating against Floyd's death. The Traore case has become emblematic of the fight against police brutality in France. The circumstances of the death of the 24-year-old Frenchman of Malian origin are still under investigation after four years of conflicting medical reports about what happened. The lawyer for two of the three police officers involved in the arrest, Rodolphe Bosselut, said the Floyd and Traore cases ""have strictly nothing to do with each other."" Bosselut told The Associated Press that Traore's death wasn't linked with the conditions of his arrest but other factors, including a pre-existing medical condition. Traore's family says he died from asphyxiation because of police tactics -- and that his last words were ""I can't breathe."" ""I can't breathe"" were also the final words of David Dungay, a 26-year-old Aboriginal man who died in a Sydney prison in 2015 while being restrained by five guards. As 3,000 people marched peacefully through Sydney, many said they had been inspired by a mixture of sympathy for African Americans amid ongoing violent protests in the U.S. and to call for change in Australia's treatment of its indigenous population, particularly involving police. The mostly Australian crowd at the authorized demonstration also included protesters from the U.S. and elsewhere. ""I'm here for my people, and for our fallen brothers and sisters around the world,"" said Sydney indigenous woman Amanda Hill, 46, who attended the rally with her daughter and two nieces. ""What's happening in America shines a light on the situation here. It doesn't matter if it's about the treatment of black men and women from here or from another country; enough is enough,"" she said. A total of 432 indigenous Australians have died in police detention since a 1991 Royal Commission — Australia's highest level of official inquiry — into Aboriginal deaths in custody, according to The Guardian newspaper. Australia has also never signed a treaty with the country's indigenous population, who suffer higher-than-average rates of infant mortality and poor health, plus shorter life expectancy and lower levels of education and employment than white Australians. Another protest was planned Tuesday in the Dutch capital The Hague, and more than 6,000 people attended a Sweden-organized online protest to express support with the Black Lives Matter movement. Among speakers was Aysha Jones, a Gambia-born and Sweden-based activist and fashion blogger. Jones said the protest was important to show support to people in America, but also to remind Swedes that racism ""does exist here, it's very real and people are being harmed from it."" More protests in various countries are planned later in the week, including a string of demonstrations in front of U.S. embassies on Saturday. The drama unfolding in the U.S. drew increasing diplomatic concern. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell's remarks in Brussels were the strongest to come out of the 27-nation bloc, saying Floyd's death was a result of an abuse of power. Borrell told reporters that ""like the people of the United States, we are shocked and appalled by the death of George Floyd."" He underlined that Europeans ""support the right to peaceful protest, and also we condemn violence and racism of any kind, and for sure, we call for a de-escalation of tensions."" German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said peaceful protests in the U.S. following Floyd's death are ""understandable and more than legitimate."" ""I can only express my hope that the peaceful protests do not continue to lead to violence, but even more express the hope that these protests have an effect in the United States,"" Maas said. More African leaders are speaking up over the killing of Floyd. ""It cannot be right that, in the 21st century, the United States, this great bastion of democracy, continues to grapple with the problem of systemic racism,"" Ghana President Nana Akufo-Addo said in a statement, adding that black people the world over are shocked and distraught. Kenyan opposition leader and former Prime Minister Raila Odinga offered a prayer for the U.S., ""that there be justice and freedom for all human beings who call America their country."" Like some in Africa who have spoken out, Odinga also noted troubles at home, saying the judging of people by character instead of skin color ""is a dream we in Africa, too, owe our citizens.""",0.0

Trump and First Lady Melania Trump traveled across town Tuesday for a brief visit to Saint John Paul II National Shrine adjacent to The Catholic University of America. The shrine is a place of prayer for Catholics but welcomes people of all faiths. The Trumps posed for photos in front of a statue of Saint Pope John Paul II outside the shrine and stood silently for a few minutes, hands clasped in front of them. They did not make remarks. Washington Archbishop Wilton D. Gregory slammed the presidential visit in a statement shortly before the Trumps' arrival. “I find it baffling that and reprehensible that any Catholic facility would allow itself to be so egregiously misused and manipulated in a fashion that violates our religious principles, which call us to defend the rights of all people even those with whom we might disagree,” Gregory said in a statement. Trump also is scheduled to sign an executive order on international religious freedom on Tuesday. Trump's visit to the shrine comes just one day after he walked across Lafayette Park next to the White House and posed for cameras outside St. John's Episcopal Church, which suffered slight damage after it was set on fire by protesters late Sunday night. Violent protests have erupted in Washington and dozens of other cities across the country following the death of George Floyd, a black man in Minneapolis who died in the custody of police. Former police officer Derrick Chauvin has been charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter in Floyd's death. Critics hammered Trump because police used tear gas and shields on protesters in Lafayette Park, essentially clearing a path for the president to walk to the historic building known as the church of presidents. The show of force came roughly half an hour before a 7 p.m. curfew was to take effect in Washington. ""Tear-gassing peaceful protesters without provocation just so that the President could pose for photos outside a church dishonors every value that faith teaches us,"" said a joint statement from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, said in a speech Tuesday in Philadelphia that the St. John's event proves Trump is ""more interested in serving the passions of his base."" ""When peaceful protesters are dispersed by the order of the president from the doorstep of the people’s house, the White House – using tear gas and flash grenades – in order to stage a photo op at a noble church, we can be forgiven for believing that the president is more interested in power than in principle,"" Biden said. Church officials protested that Trump did not call them about his plans to visit to St. John's on Monday. Mariann E. Budde, bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Washington, which includes St. John’s Episcopal Church, told CNN she was outraged by the use of tear gas to get people out of the way for a photo op. ""The president just used a Bible, the most sacred text of the Judeo-Christian tradition, and one of the churches of my diocese, without permission, as a backdrop for a message antithetical to the teachings of Jesus and everything that our churches stand for,"" she said. Bishop Gregory noted that Saint Pope John Paul II was “an ardent defender of the rights and dignity of human beings"" and ""certainly would not condone the use of tear gas and other deterrents to silence, scatter or intimidate them for a photo opportunity in front of a place of worship and peace."" White House officials said Trump did want to pay his respects to St. John's, which suffered a basement fire during protests Sunday. The president also wanted to leave the White House grounds to prove he was not “in the bunker“ because of the protesters, said one official who requested anonymity to discuss the president’s communications strategy. The president was particularly angry when word got out that the Secret Service escorted him to the bunker of the White House during protests just beyond the gates of the executive mansion on Friday, the official said. After the St. John's visit, the White House put out a statement saying protesters had been repeatedly warned to exit the park ahead of the 7 p.m. curfew. “The perimeter was expanded to help enforce the 7 p.m.curfew in the same area where rioters attempted to burn down one of our nation’s most historic churches the night before,"" spokesman Judd Deere. ""Protesters were given three warnings by the U.S. Park Police."" In a morning tweet less than two hours before his visit to the shrine,Trump took credit for crackdowns in Washington – and Minneapolis. ""D.C. had no problems last night,"" he said. ""Many arrests. Great job done by all. Overwhelming force. Domination. Likewise, Minneapolis was great (thank you President Trump!)."" A couple hundred peaceful protesters gathered down the street from the national shrine ahead of Trump’s arrival, holding up signs and chanting ""no justice, no peace"" and ""black lives matter."" Police on the scene wore baseball caps and vests, but not riot gear. As Trump's motorcade arrived, some protesters shouted expletives, and others raised their middle finger. Kathy Warner, a 77-year-old retired teacher, said she was there to honor Floyd’s memory and to protest the president. She held a sign that read ""in solidarity – RIP George Floyd – Black Lives Matter.” Warner said she hoped passing drivers would read the message and “think about the injustice done to African Americans for centuries.” Warner said she has a 49-year-old son and that her heart “hurts for moms whose sons can’t reach that age.” She called Trump’s visit to St. John’s on Monday “obscene” for the way he “poses with the Bible.” Some drivers honked in support as they passed by and shook their fists out their car windows. The shrine to the late Pope John Paul II sits on the site of the former John Paul II Cultural Center, which the Knights of Columbus bought in 2011. The lay Catholic organization established it as a shrine to John Paul and added a permanent museum exhibit about his life. Daily masses are held at the shrine, which is a destination for Catholic pilgrims. The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops declared it a national shrine on March 14, 2014, after John Paul was canonized as a saint. ""It is meant to be a place of genuine encounter with God that leads to a renewal of individuals, families, societies, and cultures,"" reads the shrine's official website, adding it is a place where God ""heals and renews every dimension of human life.""

Similar demonstrations were held in other French cities in honor of Adama Traore, who died shortly after his arrest in 2016, and in solidarity with Americans demonstrating against Floyd's death. The Traore case has become emblematic of the fight against police brutality in France. The circumstances of the death of the 24-year-old Frenchman of Malian origin are still under investigation after four years of conflicting medical reports about what happened. The lawyer for two of the three police officers involved in the arrest, Rodolphe Bosselut, said the Floyd and Traore cases ""have strictly nothing to do with each other."" Bosselut told The Associated Press that Traore's death wasn't linked with the conditions of his arrest but other factors, including a pre-existing medical condition. Traore's family says he died from asphyxiation because of police tactics -- and that his last words were ""I can't breathe."" ""I can't breathe"" were also the final words of David Dungay, a 26-year-old Aboriginal man who died in a Sydney prison in 2015 while being restrained by five guards. As 3,000 people marched peacefully through Sydney, many said they had been inspired by a mixture of sympathy for African Americans amid ongoing violent protests in the U.S. and to call for change in Australia's treatment of its indigenous population, particularly involving police. The mostly Australian crowd at the authorized demonstration also included protesters from the U.S. and elsewhere. ""I'm here for my people, and for our fallen brothers and sisters around the world,"" said Sydney indigenous woman Amanda Hill, 46, who attended the rally with her daughter and two nieces. ""What's happening in America shines a light on the situation here. It doesn't matter if it's about the treatment of black men and women from here or from another country; enough is enough,"" she said. A total of 432 indigenous Australians have died in police detention since a 1991 Royal Commission — Australia's highest level of official inquiry — into Aboriginal deaths in custody, according to The Guardian newspaper. Australia has also never signed a treaty with the country's indigenous population, who suffer higher-than-average rates of infant mortality and poor health, plus shorter life expectancy and lower levels of education and employment than white Australians. Another protest was planned Tuesday in the Dutch capital The Hague, and more than 6,000 people attended a Sweden-organized online protest to express support with the Black Lives Matter movement. Among speakers was Aysha Jones, a Gambia-born and Sweden-based activist and fashion blogger. Jones said the protest was important to show support to people in America, but also to remind Swedes that racism ""does exist here, it's very real and people are being harmed from it."" More protests in various countries are planned later in the week, including a string of demonstrations in front of U.S. embassies on Saturday. The drama unfolding in the U.S. drew increasing diplomatic concern. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell's remarks in Brussels were the strongest to come out of the 27-nation bloc, saying Floyd's death was a result of an abuse of power. Borrell told reporters that ""like the people of the United States, we are shocked and appalled by the death of George Floyd."" He underlined that Europeans ""support the right to peaceful protest, and also we condemn violence and racism of any kind, and for sure, we call for a de-escalation of tensions."" German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said peaceful protests in the U.S. following Floyd's death are ""understandable and more than legitimate."" ""I can only express my hope that the peaceful protests do not continue to lead to violence, but even more express the hope that these protests have an effect in the United States,"" Maas said. More African leaders are speaking up over the killing of Floyd. ""It cannot be right that, in the 21st century, the United States, this great bastion of democracy, continues to grapple with the problem of systemic racism,"" Ghana President Nana Akufo-Addo said in a statement, adding that black people the world over are shocked and distraught. Kenyan opposition leader and former Prime Minister Raila Odinga offered a prayer for the U.S., ""that there be justice and freedom for all human beings who call America their country."" Like some in Africa who have spoken out, Odinga also noted troubles at home, saying the judging of people by character instead of skin color ""is a dream we in Africa, too, owe our citizens.""",0.0

Trump and First Lady Melania Trump traveled across town Tuesday for a brief visit to Saint John Paul II National Shrine adjacent to The Catholic University of America. The shrine is a place of prayer for Catholics but welcomes people of all faiths. The Trumps posed for photos in front of a statue of Saint Pope John Paul II outside the shrine and stood silently for a few minutes, hands clasped in front of them. They did not make remarks. Washington Archbishop Wilton D. Gregory slammed the presidential visit in a statement shortly before the Trumps' arrival. “I find it baffling that and reprehensible that any Catholic facility would allow itself to be so egregiously misused and manipulated in a fashion that violates our religious principles, which call us to defend the rights of all people even those with whom we might disagree,” Gregory said in a statement. Trump also is scheduled to sign an executive order on international religious freedom on Tuesday. Trump's visit to the shrine comes just one day after he walked across Lafayette Park next to the White House and posed for cameras outside St. John's Episcopal Church, which suffered slight damage after it was set on fire by protesters late Sunday night. Violent protests have erupted in Washington and dozens of other cities across the country following the death of George Floyd, a black man in Minneapolis who died in the custody of police. Former police officer Derrick Chauvin has been charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter in Floyd's death. Critics hammered Trump because police used tear gas and shields on protesters in Lafayette Park, essentially clearing a path for the president to walk to the historic building known as the church of presidents. The show of force came roughly half an hour before a 7 p.m. curfew was to take effect in Washington. ""Tear-gassing peaceful protesters without provocation just so that the President could pose for photos outside a church dishonors every value that faith teaches us,"" said a joint statement from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, said in a speech Tuesday in Philadelphia that the St. John's event proves Trump is ""more interested in serving the passions of his base."" ""When peaceful protesters are dispersed by the order of the president from the doorstep of the people’s house, the White House – using tear gas and flash grenades – in order to stage a photo op at a noble church, we can be forgiven for believing that the president is more interested in power than in principle,"" Biden said. Church officials protested that Trump did not call them about his plans to visit to St. John's on Monday. Mariann E. Budde, bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Washington, which includes St. John’s Episcopal Church, told CNN she was outraged by the use of tear gas to get people out of the way for a photo op. ""The president just used a Bible, the most sacred text of the Judeo-Christian tradition, and one of the churches of my diocese, without permission, as a backdrop for a message antithetical to the teachings of Jesus and everything that our churches stand for,"" she said. Bishop Gregory noted that Saint Pope John Paul II was “an ardent defender of the rights and dignity of human beings"" and ""certainly would not condone the use of tear gas and other deterrents to silence, scatter or intimidate them for a photo opportunity in front of a place of worship and peace."" White House officials said Trump did want to pay his respects to St. John's, which suffered a basement fire during protests Sunday. The president also wanted to leave the White House grounds to prove he was not “in the bunker“ because of the protesters, said one official who requested anonymity to discuss the president’s communications strategy. The president was particularly angry when word got out that the Secret Service escorted him to the bunker of the White House during protests just beyond the gates of the executive mansion on Friday, the official said. After the St. John's visit, the White House put out a statement saying protesters had been repeatedly warned to exit the park ahead of the 7 p.m. curfew. “The perimeter was expanded to help enforce the 7 p.m.curfew in the same area where rioters attempted to burn down one of our nation’s most historic churches the night before,"" spokesman Judd Deere. ""Protesters were given three warnings by the U.S. Park Police."" In a morning tweet less than two hours before his visit to the shrine,Trump took credit for crackdowns in Washington – and Minneapolis. ""D.C. had no problems last night,"" he said. ""Many arrests. Great job done by all. Overwhelming force. Domination. Likewise, Minneapolis was great (thank you President Trump!)."" A couple hundred peaceful protesters gathered down the street from the national shrine ahead of Trump’s arrival, holding up signs and chanting ""no justice, no peace"" and ""black lives matter."" Police on the scene wore baseball caps and vests, but not riot gear. As Trump's motorcade arrived, some protesters shouted expletives, and others raised their middle finger. Kathy Warner, a 77-year-old retired teacher, said she was there to honor Floyd’s memory and to protest the president. She held a sign that read ""in solidarity – RIP George Floyd – Black Lives Matter.” Warner said she hoped passing drivers would read the message and “think about the injustice done to African Americans for centuries.” Warner said she has a 49-year-old son and that her heart “hurts for moms whose sons can’t reach that age.” She called Trump’s visit to St. John’s on Monday “obscene” for the way he “poses with the Bible.” Some drivers honked in support as they passed by and shook their fists out their car windows. The shrine to the late Pope John Paul II sits on the site of the former John Paul II Cultural Center, which the Knights of Columbus bought in 2011. The lay Catholic organization established it as a shrine to John Paul and added a permanent museum exhibit about his life. Daily masses are held at the shrine, which is a destination for Catholic pilgrims. The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops declared it a national shrine on March 14, 2014, after John Paul was canonized as a saint. ""It is meant to be a place of genuine encounter with God that leads to a renewal of individuals, families, societies, and cultures,"" reads the shrine's official website, adding it is a place where God ""heals and renews every dimension of human life.""

PARIS — Thousands of French protesters defied a virus-related police ban and rallied Tuesday against racial injustice and heavy-handed police tactics, as global outrage over what happened to George Floyd in the United States kindled frustrations across borders and continents. Clapping, cheering and waving signs reading ""Black Lives Matter"" and ""Police Everywhere, Justice Nowhere,"" the largely young, multiracial crowd streamed to the main Paris courthouse and rallied peacefully while police monitored closely from nearby corners. Earlier, thousands marched in Sydney, Australia's largest city, chanting ""I can't breathe,"" and expressions of anger erupted in multiple languages on social networks, with thousands of Swedes joining an online protest and others speaking out under the banner of #BlackOutTuesday. Diplomatic ire percolated too, with the European Union's top foreign policy official saying the bloc was ""shocked and appalled"" by Floyd's death. As protests escalated worldwide, solidarity with U.S. demonstrators increasingly mixed with local worries. ""When you refuse to treat the problem of racism ... it leads to what we see in the United States,"" said Dominique Sopo, head of French activist group SOS Racisme. ""The case of George Floyd echoes what we fear in France."" Floyd died last week after a police officer pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes even after he stopped moving and pleading for air. The death set off protests that spread across America -- and now, beyond.

(WPRI) — Two by two, a parade of people appeared before a judge in Providence District Court on Tuesday, hours after they were arrested during a night of violence and destruction in the city. Stores were damaged and looted, police cruisers were vandalized — including one that was set ablaze — and bricks and other objects were thrown at officers, according to police. As many as 100 people got inside the Providence Place mall, which had just reopened on Monday.

But that couldn’t stop the looters. At 1:42 a.m. Tuesday, he got a call from his security company telling him that his burglar alarm was going off. “The window was smashed out and people were running away with clothing,” he said. Besides sweeping up glass, Silvestri was also spraying disinfectant on blood droplet scattered about the shop. “Some of them must’ve cut themselves.” As with pretty much every other business on the street, the overnight riot could not have come at much worse a time for Silvestri, who had only been open a little more than two weeks after the coronavirus shuttered the business two months earlier. “I’m kind of at a loss of words right now,” he said. “We keep taking blows, we keep taking blows, and we weather it as best we can.” This blow, though, came with an army of volunteers who fanned out across downtown, helping businesses clean up, passing out food and water, and sharing tips with police officers investigating what happened. In Silvestri’s case that manifest itself in two young women who recorded the Connecticut license plate of a car that some of the looters rode in. It also manifest itself in Mike Ritz, the executive director of Leadership Rhode Island, who had been preparing to lead a video conference later in the morning on what America can do to solve its race problem. “I’ve got a couple of hours,” he said, adding that he had come downtown to help another store owner, Karen Beebe, owner of Modern Love, but found her store chock full of volunteers. “Never done this before,” said Ritz as he scooped shards of glass from a damaged display case. Silvestri was resolute in his view of the future. “Without a doubt we’re going to be reopening,” he said. “I don’t know how long it’s going to take. We will be back in action.” pparker@providencejournal.com (401) 277-7360 On Twitter: @projopaul",0.0

""There is no right to riot, no right to destroy others' property, and no right to throw rocks at police. But there is a fundamental "" a Constitutional "" right to protest, and I'm against clearing out a peaceful protest for a photo op that treats the Word of God as a political prop,'' said Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse. South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, the only black Republican in the Senate, said he did not think Trump's visit to St. John's Church was helpful. Scott said it was not something he would have done. ""Obviously, if your question is, should you use tear gas to clear a path so the president can go have a photo-op, the answer is no,' Scott told Politico Tuesday, while noting he did not personally see the incident. Sasse, who has at times criticized Trump but won his endorsement for reelection, said public officials nationwide 'should be lowering the temperature' over protests and violence following the death in police custody of George Floyd, an unarmed black man, in Minnesota. Four Minneapolis police officers have been fired and one has been charged with murder in Floyd's death. 'Police injustice "" like the evil murder of George Floyd "" is repugnant and merits peaceful protest aimed at change,'' Sasse said, adding that ""riots are abhorrent acts of violence that hurt the innocent.'' Both messages should be heard as Americans work to end violence and injustice, Sasse said. The comments by Sasse and Scott were among the strongest by GOP senators following Trump's demand Monday to end the heated protests and his vow to use military force to achieve that if necessary. Republicans have frequently muted any criticism of Trump, and only GOP Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah voted in favor of Trump's impeachment in February. After Trump's hardline speech Monday in the White House Rose Garden, the president walked to nearby St. John's Church, where he held up a Bible for photographers. Trump's actions drew widespread condemnation from Democrats and religious leaders who said he was misusing the Bible and the church where presidents have prayed for more than 150 years. South Dakota Sen. John Thune, the second-ranking GOP senator, said that 'as a general matter, I always think it's a good thing for our elected leaders to be spending time in church.'' Still, Thune said views of Trump's actions were ""going to be in the eye of the beholder. His supporters are going to think ... he was standing up for the things he believes in and they believe in.

1623578527,2020-06-02 14:44:20,GOP criticism muted on Trump's handling of protests,https://www.newportri.com/ZZ/news/20200602/gop-criticism-muted-on-trumps-handling-of-protests?rssfeed=true,en,True,"politics and government, united states politics and government, elections, blacks, demonstrations and riots",662950,Newport Daily News,http://www.newportdailynews.com/ee/newportdailynews/index.php,"WASHINGTON (AP) "" Most Republicans continued Tuesday to avoid any criticism of President Donald Trump, though at least two GOP senators spoke out against police use of tear gas to clear peaceful demonstrators from a park near the White House so Trump could walk to a nearby church and pose with a Bible. ""There is no right to riot, no right to destroy others' property, and no right to throw rocks at police. But there is a fundamental "" a Constitutional "" right to protest, and I'm against clearing out a peaceful protest for a photo op that treats the Word of God as a political prop,'' said Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse. South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, the only black Republican in the Senate, said he did not think Trump's visit to St. John's Church was helpful. Scott said it was not something he would have done. ""Obviously, if your question is, should you use tear gas to clear a path so the president can go have a photo-op, the answer is no,' Scott told Politico Tuesday, while noting he did not personally see the incident. Sasse, who has at times criticized Trump but won his endorsement for reelection, said public officials nationwide 'should be lowering the temperature' over protests and violence following the death in police custody of George Floyd, an unarmed black man, in Minnesota. Four Minneapolis police officers have been fired and one has been charged with murder in Floyd's death. 'Police injustice "" like the evil murder of George Floyd "" is repugnant and merits peaceful protest aimed at change,'' Sasse said, adding that ""riots are abhorrent acts of violence that hurt the innocent.'' Both messages should be heard as Americans work to end violence and injustice, Sasse said. The comments by Sasse and Scott were among the strongest by GOP senators following Trump's demand Monday to end the heated protests and his vow to use military force to achieve that if necessary. Republicans have frequently muted any criticism of Trump, and only GOP Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah voted in favor of Trump's impeachment in February. After Trump's hardline speech Monday in the White House Rose Garden, the president walked to nearby St. John's Church, where he held up a Bible for photographers. Trump's actions drew widespread condemnation from Democrats and religious leaders who said he was misusing the Bible and the church where presidents have prayed for more than 150 years. South Dakota Sen. John Thune, the second-ranking GOP senator, said that 'as a general matter, I always think it's a good thing for our elected leaders to be spending time in church.'' Still, Thune said views of Trump's actions were ""going to be in the eye of the beholder. His supporters are going to think ... he was standing up for the things he believes in and they believe in. His detractors are going to say it was a photo op.'' Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, said Trump likely ""thought this would be some unifying message, but of course it was for half the country, and the other half were outraged by it.

As more demonstrations began taking shape around the country, and cities including Washington prepared for the possibility of more violence, the president amplified his hard-line calls of a day earlier, in which he threatened to send in the military to restore order if governors didn't do it. 'NYC, CALL UP THE NATIONAL GUARD,' he tweeted. 'The lowlifes and losers are ripping you apart. Act fast!' One day after a crackdown on peaceful protesters near the White House, thousands of demonstrators massed a block away from the presidential mansion, facing law enforcement personnel standing behind a black chain-link fence. The fence was put up overnight to block access to Lafayette Park, just across the street from the White House. 'Last night pushed me way over the edge,' said Jessica DeMaio, 40, of Washington, who attended a Floyd protest Tuesday for the first time. 'Being here is better than being at home feeling helpless."" The crowd remained in place after the city's 7 p.m. curfew passed, defying warnings that the response from law enforcement could be even more forceful. But the protest lacked the tension of the previous nights' demonstrations. The crowd Tuesday was peaceful, polite even. At one point, the crowd booed when a protester climbed a light post and took down a street sign. A chant went up: 'Peaceful protest!' On Monday, law enforcement officers on foot and horseback aggressively drove protesters away from Lafayette Park, clearing the way for President Donald Trump to do a photo op at nearby St. John's Church. On Tuesday, pastors at the church prayed with demonstrators and handed out water bottles. Protests ranged across the U.S., including in New York City, Los Angeles, Miami, Houston, St. Paul, Minnesota, Columbia, South Carolina, and Orlando, Florida, where more than 1,000 people gathered in the afternoon to decry the killings of black people. 'This has to change,' said 39-year-old Aisxia Batiste, an out-of-work massage therapist in Orlando. 'Something has to give. We're done. This is the beginning of the end of something. It has to be.' In New York, midtown Manhattan was pocked with battered storefronts after Monday's protests. Macy's flagship store was among those hit when crowds of people smashed windows and looted stores as they swept through the area. A police sergeant was hospitalized after being hit by a car in the Bronx, where people walked Tuesday between ransacked buildings and a burned-out car on the Grand Concourse, a commercial thoroughfare. Police made nearly 700 arrests and Mayor Bill de Blasio extended an 8 p.m. curfew all week. 'We're going to have a tough few days,"" he warned, but added: 'We're going to beat it back.' He pleaded with community leaders to step forward and 'create peace.' Thousands of protesters marched Tuesday night in a string of demonstrations across Manhattan and Brooklyn after merchants boarded up their businesses, fearing a repeat of the night before. Many people remained on the streets after the curfew hour. Police eventually ordered them to move along and began taking some into custody. More than 20,000 National Guard members have been called up in 29 states to deal with the violence. New York is not among them, and de Blasio has said he does not want the Guard. On Tuesday, Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo called what happened in the city 'a disgrace.' 'The NYPD and the mayor did not do their job last night,' Cuomo said at a briefing in Albany. He said the mayor underestimated the problem, and the nation's largest police force was not deployed in sufficient numbers, though the city had said it doubled the usual police presence. Tuesday marked the eighth straight night of the protests, which began in Minneapolis, where Floyd died, and quickly spread across the country. The mother of George Floyd's 6-year-old daughter, Gianna, said she wanted the world to know that her little girl lost a good father. 'I want everybody to know that this is what those officers took,' Roxie Washington said during a Minneapolis news conference with her young daughter at her side. 'I want justice for him because he was good. No matter what anybody thinks, he was good.' On Monday, scattered violence flared in multiple protests, including an officer who was shot and gravely wounded outside a Las Vegas hotel and casino, and four officers shot in St. Louis. They were expected to recover. About a dozen other deaths have been reported around the country over the past week. And nearly 8,000 people nationwide have been arrested, according to a count by The Associated Press. Some protesters framed the burgeoning movement as a necessity after a string of killings by police. 'It feels like it's just been an endless cascade of hashtags of black people dying, and it feels like nothing's really being done by our political leaders to actually enact real change,' said Christine Ohenzuwa, 19, who attended a peaceful protest at the Minnesota state Capitol in St. Paul. 'There's always going to be a breaking point. I think right now, we're seeing the breaking point around the country.' 'I live in this state. It's really painful to see what's going on, but it's also really important to understand that it's connected to a system of racial violence,"" she said. Meanwhile, governors and mayors, Republicans and Democrats alike, rejected Trump's threat to send in the military, with some saying troops would be unnecessary and others questioning whether the government has such authority and warning that such a step would be dangerous. 'Denver is not Little Rock in 1957, and Donald Trump is not President Eisenhower. This is a time for healing, for bringing people together, and the best way to protect civil rights is to move away from escalating violence,' Colorado Gov. Jared Polis and Denver Mayor Michael Hancock, both Democrats, said in a statement, referring to Eisenhower's use of troops to enforce school desegregation in the South. A senior White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that the president is not rushing to send in the military and that his goal was to pressure governors to deploy more National Guard members. Such use of the military would mark a stunning federal intervention rarely seen in modern American history. Amid the protests, nine states and the District of Columbia held presidential primaries that moved Joe Biden closer to formally clinching the Democratic presidential nomination. Voters waited in long lines hours after polls closed, brushing up against curfews in Washington and Philadelphia, two cities rocked by protests. Also Tuesday, Minnesota opened an investigation into whether the Minneapolis Police Department has a pattern of discrimination against minorities. Floyd died May 25 after a white Minneapolis officer, Derek Chauvin, pressed his knee on the handcuffed black man's neck for several minutes. Chauvin has been charged with murder. Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said prosecutors are working as fast as they can to determine if the three other officers at the scene should be charged too. All four have been fired. ___ Sullivan reported from Minneapolis. Associated Press journalists across the U.S. contributed to this report.",0.0

Another was the beloved owner of a Louisville barbecue restaurant who provided free meals to officers. Yet another was a man known as 'Mr. Indianapolis,"" a former star football player. They are among those killed as protests have roiled American cities in the week since the death of George Floyd, a black man who pleaded for air as a white Minneapolis officer jammed a knee into his neck. The deaths, as well as widespread peaceful protests, have at times been overshadowed by the shocking images of heavy-handed police tactics, vandalism and arson. Dozens have been injured in the chaos. Many of the people killed were African Americans, compounding the tragedy for black communities. The death toll and circumstances of the killings are still being sorted out in many cities, but here is what we know so far: ST. LOUIS A 77-year-old retired St. Louis police captain who served 38 years on the force was shot and killed by looters at a pawn shop early Tuesday, authorities said. David Dorn was found dead on the sidewalk in front of the ransacked store. Police have not released details about what led to the shooting, and no one has been arrested. The shooting apparently was streamed on Facebook Live but has been taken down. It came on a violent night in St. Louis, which saw four officers shot, businesses burned and ransacked, and people pelting officers with rocks hours following a peaceful protest. Dorn was a friend of the pawn shop's owner and frequently checked on the business when alarms went off, wife Ann Marie Dorn told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. David Dorn's personality was 'bigger than life,' said former St. Louis County police Chief Tim Fitch. 'He was a fun guy, a happy guy."" Dorn retired in October 2007 and then became police chief of Moline Acres, a small town north of St. Louis. ___ LOUISVILLE Police and the National Guard troops trying to clear a crowd Monday heard gunshots and returned fire, killing David McAtee, the owner of a barbecue restaurant. The mayor fired the police chief after finding out officers did not turn on their body-worn cameras. State police and the U.S. attorney also are investigating. McAtee was a 53-year-old African American man known for offering free meals to officers who stopped by his restaurant. 'We lost a wonderful citizen,' Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer said. 'David was a friend to many, a well-known barbecue man.' Acting police Chief Robert Schroeder said Tuesday that video from security cameras at McAtee's business and an adjoining store showed McAtee firing a gun as officers approached. 'This video does not provide all the answers. But we are releasing it to provide transparency. It does not answer every question, including why did he fire and where were police at the time he fired,' Schroeder said. The protests also have centered on the death of Breonna Taylor, a black woman killed in her Louisville home in March as narcotics detectives serving a search warrant knocked down her door. No drugs were found. ___ OAKLAND, CALIFORNIA A federal officer was providing security at a U.S. courthouse during a protest when someone fired shots from a vehicle. Dave Patrick Underwood, 53, died and another officer was critically wounded. It wasn't immediately clear if the drive-by shooting was related to the protests, though the federal building's glass doors were smashed and the front entrance was sprayed with anti-police graffiti. No one has been arrested. Underwood, who was black, and the other officer were contracted security officers employed by the Department of Homeland Security's Federal Protective Service. They were monitoring a nearby protest. Underwood was the brother of Angela Underwood Jacobs, recently a Republican candidate to fill a vacant congressional seat north of Los Angeles. ___ INDIANAPOLIS Two people were killed this past weekend amid unrest, including 38-year-old Chris Beaty, a former offensive lineman for Indiana University. Beaty was known as 'Mr. Indianapolis"" and remained involved with the Hoosiers long after graduation. He also was a prominent businessman, running multiple nightclubs. 'I am at a loss for words. The news of the passing of Chris Beaty is just devastating,' coach Tom Allen said in a statement. 'Since I returned home to coach at Indiana, Chris embraced me, encouraged me and supported me! His passion for life and Indiana Football energized me every time we were together."" The circumstances of Beaty's shooting weren't immediately clear, but some media reports said it happened near his apartment. It came the same night an 18-year-old man was fatally shot as protests erupted in the city. ___ DAVENPORT, IOWA Police are investigating the deaths of 22-year-old Italia Kelly, who was shot Monday while leaving a protest outside a Walmart, and of a man found near where suspects exchanged gunfire with police in the city of 100,000 people across the Mississippi River from Illinois. Kelly and a friend were getting in a vehicle to leave because a protest had turned unruly when she was struck in the back by a bullet, said her aunt, Amy Hale of Atchison, Kansas. No arrests have been made. 'She was always smiling, always laughing. That's why it's so sad that she was taken in such a violent way,' Hale said. 'That is not Italia. She was the bright, bubbly big personality in the room.' Separately, authorities said an officer was 'ambushed' with gunfire Sunday. Another officer shot back, and the suspects fled but were arrested. Near where the officer was wounded, police found a man shot to death and a handgun under his body. His identity wasn't released. Police said surveillance video shows that the man and some of the arrested suspects were involved in a shooting outside a jewelry store hours earlier. They were casing the business when other cars arrived and multiple people fired shots at each other, police said. ___ MINNEAPOLIS In what is believed to be the first killing since the protests broke out, Calvin L. Horton Jr. was fatally shot outside a pawn shop last week. The owner of the pawn shop, who is white, was arrested in the death of Horton, a 43-year-old black man. Police say they are investigating the circumstances of the killing, including whether it was related to protests in the neighborhood. The shop was described as having been significantly damaged during the unrest. ___ OMAHA, NEBRASKA James Scurlock, a 22-year-old black man, was killed Saturday after authorities said he tussled with the owner of two downtown bars. Surveillance video of the strip of bars shows a group of people, including Scurlock, approach white bar owner Jake Gardner. Two people shove Gardner to the ground, and he fired shots in the air. Seconds later, Scurlock is seen jumping on Gardner, who then fires the gun over his shoulder, striking Scurlock. Authorities have declined to press charges in the death, calling the shooting self-defense. But Gardner could still face misdemeanor gun charges because his concealed carry permit for the gun had expired, the police chief said. ___ DETROIT A 21-year-old man was killed in downtown Detroit after someone fired shots into a vehicle during a protest. According to a police report, the man was sitting in the driver's seat of a car in a parking lot with two others when someone opened fire and then ran away. ___ SUBURBAN CHICAGO Two people were killed during unrest Monday in the suburb of Cicero, according to a town official. Spokesman Ray Hanania did not provide details about those who were killed but said it happened during protests. ___ Associated Press journalists around the country contributed to this report.",0.0

Jared Polis and Denver Mayor Michael Hancock, both Democrats, said in a statement, referring to Eisenhower's use of troops to enforce school desegregation in the South. A senior White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that the president is not rushing to send in the military and that his goal was to pressure governors to deploy more National Guard members. Such use of the military would mark a stunning federal intervention rarely seen in modern American history. Amid the protests, nine states and the District of Columbia held presidential primaries that moved Joe Biden closer to formally clinching the Democratic presidential nomination. Voters waited in long lines hours after polls closed, brushing up against curfews in Washington and Philadelphia, two cities rocked by protests. Also Tuesday, Minnesota opened an investigation into whether the Minneapolis Police Department has a pattern of discrimination against minorities. Floyd died May 25 after a white Minneapolis officer, Derek Chauvin, pressed his knee on the handcuffed black man's neck for several minutes. Chauvin has been charged with murder. Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said prosecutors are working as fast as they can to determine if the three other officers at the scene should be charged too. All four have been fired. ___ Sullivan reported from Minneapolis. Associated Press journalists across the U.S. contributed to this report.",0.0
1623581548,2020-06-02 14:49:19,Paris: Tear gas fired at protest against police violence,https://www.newportri.com/ZZ/news/20200602/paris-tear-gas-fired-at-protest-against-police-violence?rssfeed=true,en,True,demonstrations and riots,662951,Newport Life,http://www.newportlifemagazine.com/,"PARIS (AP) "" Tear gas choked Paris streets as riot police faced off with protesters setting fires Tuesday amid growing global outrage over George Floyd's death in the United States, racial injustice and heavy-handed police tactics around the world. French protesters took a knee and raised their fists while firefighters struggled to extinguish multiple blazes as a largely peaceful, multiracial demonstration degenerated into scattered tensions. Police said at least 20,000 people joined the demonstration, defying a virus-related ban on protests to pay homage to Floyd and Adama Traore, a French black man who died in police custody. Electric scooters and construction barriers went up in flames, and smoke stained a sign reading 'Restaurant Open' "" on the first day French cafes were allowed to open after nearly three months of virus lockdown. Chanting 'I can't breathe,' thousands marched peacefully through Australia's largest city, while thousands more demonstrated in the Dutch capital of The Hague and hundreds rallied in Tel Aviv. Expressions of anger erupted in multiple languages on social networks, with thousands of Swedes joining an online protest and others speaking out under the banner of #BlackOutTuesday. Diplomatic ire percolated too, with the European Union's top foreign policy official saying the bloc was 'shocked and appalled' by Floyd's death. Floyd died last week after a police officer pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes even after he stopped moving and pleading for air. The death set off protests that spread across America "" and now, beyond. As demonstrations escalated worldwide, solidarity with U.S. protesters increasingly mixed with local worries. 'This happened in the United States, but it happens in France, it happens everywhere,' Paris protester Xavier Dintimille said. While he said police violence seems worse in the U.S., he added, 'all blacks live this to a degree.' Fears of the coronavirus remain close to the surface and were the reason cited for banning Tuesday's protest at the main Paris courthouse, because gatherings of more than 10 people remain forbidden. But demonstrators showed up anyway. Some said police violence worsened during virus confinement in working class suburbs with large minority populations, deepening a feeling of injustice. As the Paris demonstration wound down, police fired volley after volley of tear gas and protesters threw debris. Police were less visible than usual at the city's frequent protests. Tensions also erupted at a related protest in the southern city of Marseille. The demonstrations were held in honor of Traore, who died shortly after his arrest in 2016, and in solidarity with Americans demonstrating against Floyd's death. The Traore case has become emblematic of the fight against police brutality in France. The circumstances of the death of the 24-year-old Frenchman of Malian origin are still under investigation after four years of conflicting medical reports about what happened. The lawyer for two of the three police officers involved in the arrest, Rodolphe Bosselut, said the Floyd and Traore cases 'have strictly nothing to do with each other."" Bosselut told The Associated Press that Traore's death wasn't linked with the conditions of his arrest but other factors, including a preexisting medical condition. Traore's family says he died from asphyxiation because of police tactics "" and that his last words were 'I can't breathe.' 'I can't breathe' were also the final words of David Dungay, a 26-year-old Aboriginal man who died in a Sydney prison in 2015 while being restrained by five guards. As 3,000 people marched peacefully through Sydney, many said they had been inspired by a mixture of sympathy for African Americans and to call for change in Australia's treatment of its indigenous population, particularly involving police. The mostly Australian crowd at the authorized demonstration also included protesters from the U.S. and elsewhere. 'I'm here for my people, and for our fallen brothers and sisters around the world,' said Sydney indigenous woman Amanda Hill, 46, who attended the rally with her daughter and two nieces. 'What's happening in America shines a light on the situation here."" Even as U.S. President Donald Trump fanned anger by threatening to send in troops on American protesters, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau refrained from directly criticizing him and said the protests should force awareness of racism everywhere. 'We all watch in horror and consternation what's going on in the United States,' he said after pausing 21 seconds before answering. 'But it is a time for us as Canadians to recognize that we, too, have our challenges, that black Canadians and racialized Canadians face discrimination as a lived reality every single day. There is systemic discrimination in Canada.' More protests in various countries are planned later in the week, including a string of demonstrations in front of U.S. embassies on Saturday. The drama unfolding in the U.S. drew increasing diplomatic concern. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell's remarks in Brussels were the strongest to come out of the 27-nation bloc, saying Floyd's death was a result of an abuse of power. Borrell told reporters that 'like the people of the United States, we are shocked and appalled by the death of George Floyd.' He underlined that Europeans 'support the right to peaceful protest, and also we condemn violence and racism of any kind, and for sure, we call for a de-escalation of tensions.' German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said peaceful protests in the U.S. following Floyd's death are 'understandable and more than legitimate.' 'I can only express my hope that the peaceful protests do not continue to lead to violence, but even more express the hope that these protests have an effect in the United States,' Maas said. More African leaders are speaking up over the killing of Floyd. 'It cannot be right that, in the 21st century, the United States, this great bastion of democracy, continues to grapple with the problem of systemic racism,' Ghana President Nana Akufo-Addo said in a statement, adding that black people the world over are shocked and distraught. Kenyan opposition leader and former Prime Minister Raila Odinga offered a prayer for the U.S., 'that there be justice and freedom for all human beings who call America their country.' Like some in Africa who have spoken out, Odinga also noted troubles at home, saying the judging of people by character instead of skin color 'is a dream we in Africa, too, owe our citizens.' ___ Associated Press writers Rick Rycroft in Sydney, Rod McGuirk in Canberra, Australia, Lori Hinnant in Paris, Aritz Parra in Madrid, Frank Jordans in Berlin, Lorne Cook in Brussels, Peter Dejong in The Hague contributed. ___ Follow AP's latest news about the protests at https://apnews.com/GeorgeFloyd",0.0

The deaths, as well as widespread peaceful protests, have at times been overshadowed by the shocking images of heavy-handed police tactics, vandalism and arson. Dozens have been injured in the chaos. Many of the people killed were African Americans, compounding the tragedy for black communities. The death toll and circumstances of the killings are still being sorted out in many cities, but here is what we know so far: ST. LOUIS A 77-year-old retired St. Louis police captain who served 38 years on the force was shot and killed by looters at a pawn shop early Tuesday, authorities said. David Dorn was found dead on the sidewalk in front of the ransacked store. Police have not released details about what led to the shooting, and no one has been arrested. The shooting apparently was streamed on Facebook Live but has been taken down. It came on a violent night in St. Louis, which saw four officers shot, businesses burned and ransacked, and people pelting officers with rocks hours following a peaceful protest. Dorn was a friend of the pawn shop's owner and frequently checked on the business when alarms went off, wife Ann Marie Dorn told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. David Dorn's personality was 'bigger than life,' said former St. Louis County police Chief Tim Fitch. 'He was a fun guy, a happy guy."" Dorn retired in October 2007 and then became police chief of Moline Acres, a small town north of St. Louis. ___ LOUISVILLE Police and the National Guard troops trying to clear a crowd Monday heard gunshots and returned fire, killing David McAtee, the owner of a barbecue restaurant. The mayor fired the police chief after finding out officers did not turn on their body-worn cameras. State police and the U.S. attorney also are investigating. McAtee was a 53-year-old African American man known for offering free meals to officers who stopped by his restaurant. 'We lost a wonderful citizen,' Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer said. 'David was a friend to many, a well-known barbecue man.' Acting police Chief Robert Schroeder said Tuesday that video from security cameras at McAtee's business and an adjoining store showed McAtee firing a gun as officers approached. 'This video does not provide all the answers. But we are releasing it to provide transparency. It does not answer every question, including why did he fire and where were police at the time he fired,' Schroeder said. The protests also have centered on the death of Breonna Taylor, a black woman killed in her Louisville home in March as narcotics detectives serving a search warrant knocked down her door. No drugs were found. ___ OAKLAND, CALIFORNIA A federal officer was providing security at a U.S. courthouse during a protest when someone fired shots from a vehicle. Dave Patrick Underwood, 53, died and another officer was critically wounded. It wasn't immediately clear if the drive-by shooting was related to the protests, though the federal building's glass doors were smashed and the front entrance was sprayed with anti-police graffiti. No one has been arrested. Underwood, who was black, and the other officer were contracted security officers employed by the Department of Homeland Security's Federal Protective Service. They were monitoring a nearby protest. Underwood was the brother of Angela Underwood Jacobs, recently a Republican candidate to fill a vacant congressional seat north of Los Angeles. ___ INDIANAPOLIS Two people were killed this past weekend amid unrest, including 38-year-old Chris Beaty, a former offensive lineman for Indiana University. Beaty was known as 'Mr. Indianapolis"" and remained involved with the Hoosiers long after graduation. He also was a prominent businessman, running multiple nightclubs. 'I am at a loss for words. The news of the passing of Chris Beaty is just devastating,' coach Tom Allen said in a statement. 'Since I returned home to coach at Indiana, Chris embraced me, encouraged me and supported me! His passion for life and Indiana Football energized me every time we were together."" The circumstances of Beaty's shooting weren't immediately clear, but some media reports said it happened near his apartment. It came the same night an 18-year-old man was fatally shot as protests erupted in the city. ___ DAVENPORT, IOWA Police are investigating the deaths of 22-year-old Italia Kelly, who was shot Monday while leaving a protest outside a Walmart, and of a man found near where suspects exchanged gunfire with police in the city of 100,000 people across the Mississippi River from Illinois. Kelly and a friend were getting in a vehicle to leave because a protest had turned unruly when she was struck in the back by a bullet, said her aunt, Amy Hale of Atchison, Kansas. No arrests have been made. 'She was always smiling, always laughing. That's why it's so sad that she was taken in such a violent way,' Hale said. 'That is not Italia. She was the bright, bubbly big personality in the room.' Separately, authorities said an officer was 'ambushed' with gunfire Sunday. Another officer shot back, and the suspects fled but were arrested. Near where the officer was wounded, police found a man shot to death and a handgun under his body. His identity wasn't released. Police said surveillance video shows that the man and some of the arrested suspects were involved in a shooting outside a jewelry store hours earlier. They were casing the business when other cars arrived and multiple people fired shots at each other, police said. ___ MINNEAPOLIS In what is believed to be the first killing since the protests broke out, Calvin L. Horton Jr. was fatally shot outside a pawn shop last week. The owner of the pawn shop, who is white, was arrested in the death of Horton, a 43-year-old black man. Police say they are investigating the circumstances of the killing, including whether it was related to protests in the neighborhood. The shop was described as having been significantly damaged during the unrest. ___ OMAHA, NEBRASKA James Scurlock, a 22-year-old black man, was killed Saturday after authorities said he tussled with the owner of two downtown bars. Surveillance video of the strip of bars shows a group of people, including Scurlock, approach white bar owner Jake Gardner. Two people shove Gardner to the ground, and he fired shots in the air. Seconds later, Scurlock is seen jumping on Gardner, who then fires the gun over his shoulder, striking Scurlock. Authorities have declined to press charges in the death, calling the shooting self-defense. But Gardner could still face misdemeanor gun charges because his concealed carry permit for the gun had expired, the police chief said. ___ DETROIT A 21-year-old man was killed in downtown Detroit after someone fired shots into a vehicle during a protest. According to a police report, the man was sitting in the driver's seat of a car in a parking lot with two others when someone opened fire and then ran away. ___ SUBURBAN CHICAGO Two people were killed during unrest Monday in the suburb of Cicero, according to a town official.

1623583595,2020-06-02 14:44:20,GOP criticism muted on Trump's handling of protests,https://www.newportri.com/ZZ/news/20200602/gop-criticism-muted-on-trumps-handling-of-protests?rssfeed=true,en,True,"politics and government, united states politics and government, elections, blacks, demonstrations and riots",653261,Mercury - United States - Rhode Island,http://www.newportmercury.com/,"WASHINGTON (AP) "" Most Republicans continued Tuesday to avoid any criticism of President Donald Trump, though at least two GOP senators spoke out against police use of tear gas to clear peaceful demonstrators from a park near the White House so Trump could walk to a nearby church and pose with a Bible. ""There is no right to riot, no right to destroy others' property, and no right to throw rocks at police. But there is a fundamental "" a Constitutional "" right to protest, and I'm against clearing out a peaceful protest for a photo op that treats the Word of God as a political prop,'' said Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse. South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, the only black Republican in the Senate, said he did not think Trump's visit to St. John's Church was helpful. Scott said it was not something he would have done. ""Obviously, if your question is, should you use tear gas to clear a path so the president can go have a photo-op, the answer is no,' Scott told Politico Tuesday, while noting he did not personally see the incident. Sasse, who has at times criticized Trump but won his endorsement for reelection, said public officials nationwide 'should be lowering the temperature' over protests and violence following the death in police custody of George Floyd, an unarmed black man, in Minnesota. Four Minneapolis police officers have been fired and one has been charged with murder in Floyd's death. 'Police injustice "" like the evil murder of George Floyd "" is repugnant and merits peaceful protest aimed at change,'' Sasse said, adding that ""riots are abhorrent acts of violence that hurt the innocent.'' Both messages should be heard as Americans work to end violence and injustice, Sasse said. The comments by Sasse and Scott were among the strongest by GOP senators following Trump's demand Monday to end the heated protests and his vow to use military force to achieve that if necessary. Republicans have frequently muted any criticism of Trump, and only GOP Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah voted in favor of Trump's impeachment in February. After Trump's hardline speech Monday in the White House Rose Garden, the president walked to nearby St. John's Church, where he held up a Bible for photographers. Trump's actions drew widespread condemnation from Democrats and religious leaders who said he was misusing the Bible and the church where presidents have prayed for more than 150 years. South Dakota Sen. John Thune, the second-ranking GOP senator, said that 'as a general matter, I always think it's a good thing for our elected leaders to be spending time in church.'' Still, Thune said views of Trump's actions were ""going to be in the eye of the beholder. His supporters are going to think ... he was standing up for the things he believes in and they believe in. His detractors are going to say it was a photo op.'' Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, said Trump likely ""thought this would be some unifying message, but of course it was for half the country, and the other half were outraged by it. And that's just where we are, sadly.' On Trump's threat to send in the military to quell violence, Cornyn and Thune said they hope Trump does not resort to that. While Trump 'arguably' has the authority to use military force, 'so far he hasn't done it,'' Cornyn said. 'Hopefully, he won't do it. It won't be necessary. And we will try to bring some peace back to our communities.' Thune said he would 'prefer that these things be handled by the state and local authorities. You want to de-escalate, rather than escalate.' Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., declined to comment on Trump's actions, but said he was relieved there were no deaths and few injuries in the nation's capital Monday night. McConnell condemned rioting in his home city of Louisville and other cities, even as he said the nation is united in horror and opposition to Floyd's death. 'This selfish violence takes us farther away from any national healing or forward progress. It does not bring positive change any closer. It pushes it farther away,'' McConnell said on the Senate floor. 'The legitimate and important voices of peaceful protesters will never be heard over the wailing of fire alarms, the smashing of plate-glass windows, and the sirens of ambulances coming for police officers who have been assaulted or shot in the head,'' McConnell said. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said he was glad Trump went to a ""historic church in our capital city that was firebombed by terrorists. It was important for the president to be there and say we will not be cowed by terrorists. ... All of us have a First Amendment right to speak, but you don't have a right to burn a church.'' __ Associated Press writer Mary Clare Jalonick contributed to this story.",0.0

As more demonstrations began taking shape around the country, and cities including Washington prepared for the possibility of more violence, the president amplified his hard-line calls of a day earlier, in which he threatened to send in the military to restore order if governors didn't do it. 'NYC, CALL UP THE NATIONAL GUARD,' he tweeted. 'The lowlifes and losers are ripping you apart. Act fast!' One day after a crackdown on peaceful protesters near the White House, thousands of demonstrators massed a block away from the presidential mansion, facing law enforcement personnel standing behind a black chain-link fence. The fence was put up overnight to block access to Lafayette Park, just across the street from the White House. 'Last night pushed me way over the edge,' said Jessica DeMaio, 40, of Washington, who attended a Floyd protest Tuesday for the first time. 'Being here is better than being at home feeling helpless."" The crowd remained in place after the city's 7 p.m. curfew passed, defying warnings that the response from law enforcement could be even more forceful. But the protest lacked the tension of the previous nights' demonstrations. The crowd Tuesday was peaceful, polite even. At one point, the crowd booed when a protester climbed a light post and took down a street sign. A chant went up: 'Peaceful protest!' On Monday, law enforcement officers on foot and horseback aggressively drove protesters away from Lafayette Park, clearing the way for President Donald Trump to do a photo op at nearby St. John's Church. On Tuesday, pastors at the church prayed with demonstrators and handed out water bottles. Protests ranged across the U.S., including in New York City, Los Angeles, Miami, Houston, St. Paul, Minnesota, Columbia, South Carolina, and Orlando, Florida, where more than 1,000 people gathered in the afternoon to decry the killings of black people. 'This has to change,' said 39-year-old Aisxia Batiste, an out-of-work massage therapist in Orlando. 'Something has to give. We're done. This is the beginning of the end of something. It has to be.' In New York, midtown Manhattan was pocked with battered storefronts after Monday's protests. Macy's flagship store was among those hit when crowds of people smashed windows and looted stores as they swept through the area. A police sergeant was hospitalized after being hit by a car in the Bronx, where people walked Tuesday between ransacked buildings and a burned-out car on the Grand Concourse, a commercial thoroughfare. Police made nearly 700 arrests and Mayor Bill de Blasio extended an 8 p.m. curfew all week. 'We're going to have a tough few days,"" he warned, but added: 'We're going to beat it back.' He pleaded with community leaders to step forward and 'create peace.' Thousands of protesters marched Tuesday night in a string of demonstrations across Manhattan and Brooklyn after merchants boarded up their businesses, fearing a repeat of the night before. Many people remained on the streets after the curfew hour. Police eventually ordered them to move along and began taking some into custody. More than 20,000 National Guard members have been called up in 29 states to deal with the violence. New York is not among them, and de Blasio has said he does not want the Guard. On Tuesday, Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo called what happened in the city 'a disgrace.' 'The NYPD and the mayor did not do their job last night,' Cuomo said at a briefing in Albany. He said the mayor underestimated the problem, and the nation's largest police force was not deployed in sufficient numbers, though the city had said it doubled the usual police presence. Tuesday marked the eighth straight night of the protests, which began in Minneapolis, where Floyd died, and quickly spread across the country. The mother of George Floyd's 6-year-old daughter, Gianna, said she wanted the world to know that her little girl lost a good father. 'I want everybody to know that this is what those officers took,' Roxie Washington said during a Minneapolis news conference with her young daughter at her side. 'I want justice for him because he was good. No matter what anybody thinks, he was good.' On Monday, scattered violence flared in multiple protests, including an officer who was shot and gravely wounded outside a Las Vegas hotel and casino, and four officers shot in St. Louis. They were expected to recover. About a dozen other deaths have been reported around the country over the past week. And nearly 8,000 people nationwide have been arrested, according to a count by The Associated Press. Some protesters framed the burgeoning movement as a necessity after a string of killings by police. 'It feels like it's just been an endless cascade of hashtags of black people dying, and it feels like nothing's really being done by our political leaders to actually enact real change,' said Christine Ohenzuwa, 19, who attended a peaceful protest at the Minnesota state Capitol in St. Paul. 'There's always going to be a breaking point. I think right now, we're seeing the breaking point around the country.' 'I live in this state. It's really painful to see what's going on, but it's also really important to understand that it's connected to a system of racial violence,"" she said. Meanwhile, governors and mayors, Republicans and Democrats alike, rejected Trump's threat to send in the military, with some saying troops would be unnecessary and others questioning whether the government has such authority and warning that such a step would be dangerous. 'Denver is not Little Rock in 1957, and Donald Trump is not President Eisenhower. This is a time for healing, for bringing people together, and the best way to protect civil rights is to move away from escalating violence,' Colorado Gov. Jared Polis and Denver Mayor Michael Hancock, both Democrats, said in a statement, referring to Eisenhower's use of troops to enforce school desegregation in the South. A senior White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that the president is not rushing to send in the military and that his goal was to pressure governors to deploy more National Guard members. Such use of the military would mark a stunning federal intervention rarely seen in modern American history. Amid the protests, nine states and the District of Columbia held presidential primaries that moved Joe Biden closer to formally clinching the Democratic presidential nomination. Voters waited in long lines hours after polls closed, brushing up against curfews in Washington and Philadelphia, two cities rocked by protests. Also Tuesday, Minnesota opened an investigation into whether the Minneapolis Police Department has a pattern of discrimination against minorities. Floyd died May 25 after a white Minneapolis officer, Derek Chauvin, pressed his knee on the handcuffed black man's neck for several minutes. Chauvin has been charged with murder. Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said prosecutors are working as fast as they can to determine if the three other officers at the scene should be charged too. All four have been fired. ___ Sullivan reported from Minneapolis. Associated Press journalists across the U.S. contributed to this report.",0.0

Another was the beloved owner of a Louisville barbecue restaurant who provided free meals to officers. Yet another was a man known as 'Mr. Indianapolis,"" a former star football player. They are among those killed as protests have roiled American cities in the week since the death of George Floyd, a black man who pleaded for air as a white Minneapolis officer jammed a knee into his neck. The deaths, as well as widespread peaceful protests, have at times been overshadowed by the shocking images of heavy-handed police tactics, vandalism and arson. Dozens have been injured in the chaos. Many of the people killed were African Americans, compounding the tragedy for black communities. The death toll and circumstances of the killings are still being sorted out in many cities, but here is what we know so far: ST. LOUIS A 77-year-old retired St. Louis police captain who served 38 years on the force was shot and killed by looters at a pawn shop early Tuesday, authorities said. David Dorn was found dead on the sidewalk in front of the ransacked store. Police have not released details about what led to the shooting, and no one has been arrested. The shooting apparently was streamed on Facebook Live but has been taken down. It came on a violent night in St. Louis, which saw four officers shot, businesses burned and ransacked, and people pelting officers with rocks hours following a peaceful protest. Dorn was a friend of the pawn shop's owner and frequently checked on the business when alarms went off, wife Ann Marie Dorn told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. David Dorn's personality was 'bigger than life,' said former St. Louis County police Chief Tim Fitch. 'He was a fun guy, a happy guy."" Dorn retired in October 2007 and then became police chief of Moline Acres, a small town north of St. Louis. ___ LOUISVILLE Police and the National Guard troops trying to clear a crowd Monday heard gunshots and returned fire, killing David McAtee, the owner of a barbecue restaurant. The mayor fired the police chief after finding out officers did not turn on their body-worn cameras. State police and the U.S. attorney also are investigating. McAtee was a 53-year-old African American man known for offering free meals to officers who stopped by his restaurant. 'We lost a wonderful citizen,' Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer said. 'David was a friend to many, a well-known barbecue man.' Acting police Chief Robert Schroeder said Tuesday that video from security cameras at McAtee's business and an adjoining store showed McAtee firing a gun as officers approached. 'This video does not provide all the answers. But we are releasing it to provide transparency. It does not answer every question, including why did he fire and where were police at the time he fired,' Schroeder said. The protests also have centered on the death of Breonna Taylor, a black woman killed in her Louisville home in March as narcotics detectives serving a search warrant knocked down her door. No drugs were found. ___ OAKLAND, CALIFORNIA A federal officer was providing security at a U.S. courthouse during a protest when someone fired shots from a vehicle. Dave Patrick Underwood, 53, died and another officer was critically wounded. It wasn't immediately clear if the drive-by shooting was related to the protests, though the federal building's glass doors were smashed and the front entrance was sprayed with anti-police graffiti. No one has been arrested. Underwood, who was black, and the other officer were contracted security officers employed by the Department of Homeland Security's Federal Protective Service. They were monitoring a nearby protest. Underwood was the brother of Angela Underwood Jacobs, recently a Republican candidate to fill a vacant congressional seat north of Los Angeles. ___ INDIANAPOLIS Two people were killed this past weekend amid unrest, including 38-year-old Chris Beaty, a former offensive lineman for Indiana University. Beaty was known as 'Mr. Indianapolis"" and remained involved with the Hoosiers long after graduation. He also was a prominent businessman, running multiple nightclubs. 'I am at a loss for words. The news of the passing of Chris Beaty is just devastating,' coach Tom Allen said in a statement. 'Since I returned home to coach at Indiana, Chris embraced me, encouraged me and supported me! His passion for life and Indiana Football energized me every time we were together."" The circumstances of Beaty's shooting weren't immediately clear, but some media reports said it happened near his apartment. It came the same night an 18-year-old man was fatally shot as protests erupted in the city. ___ DAVENPORT, IOWA Police are investigating the deaths of 22-year-old Italia Kelly, who was shot Monday while leaving a protest outside a Walmart, and of a man found near where suspects exchanged gunfire with police in the city of 100,000 people across the Mississippi River from Illinois. Kelly and a friend were getting in a vehicle to leave because a protest had turned unruly when she was struck in the back by a bullet, said her aunt, Amy Hale of Atchison, Kansas. No arrests have been made. 'She was always smiling, always laughing. That's why it's so sad that she was taken in such a violent way,' Hale said. 'That is not Italia. She was the bright, bubbly big personality in the room.' Separately, authorities said an officer was 'ambushed' with gunfire Sunday. Another officer shot back, and the suspects fled but were arrested. Near where the officer was wounded, police found a man shot to death and a handgun under his body. His identity wasn't released. Police said surveillance video shows that the man and some of the arrested suspects were involved in a shooting outside a jewelry store hours earlier. They were casing the business when other cars arrived and multiple people fired shots at each other, police said. ___ MINNEAPOLIS In what is believed to be the first killing since the protests broke out, Calvin L. Horton Jr. was fatally shot outside a pawn shop last week. The owner of the pawn shop, who is white, was arrested in the death of Horton, a 43-year-old black man. Police say they are investigating the circumstances of the killing, including whether it was related to protests in the neighborhood. The shop was described as having been significantly damaged during the unrest. ___ OMAHA, NEBRASKA James Scurlock, a 22-year-old black man, was killed Saturday after authorities said he tussled with the owner of two downtown bars. Surveillance video of the strip of bars shows a group of people, including Scurlock, approach white bar owner Jake Gardner. Two people shove Gardner to the ground, and he fired shots in the air. Seconds later, Scurlock is seen jumping on Gardner, who then fires the gun over his shoulder, striking Scurlock. Authorities have declined to press charges in the death, calling the shooting self-defense. But Gardner could still face misdemeanor gun charges because his concealed carry permit for the gun had expired, the police chief said. ___ DETROIT A 21-year-old man was killed in downtown Detroit after someone fired shots into a vehicle during a protest. According to a police report, the man was sitting in the driver's seat of a car in a parking lot with two others when someone opened fire and then ran away. ___ SUBURBAN CHICAGO Two people were killed during unrest Monday in the suburb of Cicero, according to a town official. Spokesman Ray Hanania did not provide details about those who were killed but said it happened during protests. ___ Associated Press journalists around the country contributed to this report.",0.0

A youth activist, she recently brought a large audience to tears when she described what was broken about the city’s public schools. Schenck was one of the people interviewed by The Journal on Tuesday after a night of looting and violence in downtown Providence. A sophomore at the Met School in Providence, she is organizing a non-violent youth demonstration in Providence on June 14. She recently dropped out of another youth-led protest over concerns there weren’t enough safeguards to keep it peaceful. Here’s what Schenck and other leaders of Rhode Island’s black and faith communities had to say about Monday’s melee. Jaychele Schenck: ""I was so disappointed in our community. There are so many other ways for our voices to be heard. We shouldn’t be using the death of a black man to steal from our communities. ""There are so many positive ways to channel that anger. There are ways to call out people in power and let your voice be heard at peaceful protests."" The Rev. Jeffrey A. Williams, bishop of The King’s Cathedral in Providence: ""Two words come to mind: tragedy and understanding. The tragedy is that individuals felt it was necessary to take advantage of a nation in mourning to loot and riot. The understandable part is that when change doesn’t come voluntarily from the top, it will come from the bottom. ""This is yet another manifestation of rage and anger, and individuals not being heard. I wouldn’t want it thought that this should be condoned in any way. It has no place in a civilized society. ""Some of the rioting is coming out of unrequited injustices…. We have to sit with devastation of historic racism. Until we get there, the idea of reconciliation is fantasy. We have to go back first before we move forward. ""We have to own it, from the White House to the governor’s house to your house and my house. Otherwise, this generation will be hellbent on destroying itself because they fear nothing."" Rabbi Barry Dolinger, president of the Board of Rabbis of Greater Rhode Island. ""The natural instinct is to focus on that which is controversial, but that only distracts us from the larger and much more important issue…. the systems that have imprisoned and impoverished black people in this country for centuries. ""There is a great role for faith-based communities to play in rooting this struggle in the deeper, shared values between communities, with the persistence to overcome and the ability to heal, to forgive and to make whole. ""How can we take this freighted moment to see the anger of black people and respond with empathy, listening and action to try to make a better future? This is a moment of opportunity. ...The real thing is to listen."" The Most Rev. Thomas J. Tobin, bishop of the Diocese of Providence: ""Resorting to violence does not honor the memory of George Floyd, whose tragic death in Minneapolis is morally offensive and repugnant to all. Nor does it promote the just cause of civil rights. ... ""It is very clear that there are pressing issues in our society that urgently need to be addressed and corrected – including racism, inequality, and discrimination ... The Catholic Church fully supports those who are promoting these values in legitimate and peaceful ways. ""The Diocese of Providence also stands in solidarity with public officials and law enforcement officers as they seek to ensure the safety and security of our community. The recent incidents of planned violence here and elsewhere cannot be encouraged or accepted."" Jim Vincent, president of the NAACP Providence Branch. ""I don’t think these people were thinking about the family of George Floyd or institutional racism at all. That’s disappointing, but we are not going to let anyone change the subject again. We are not going to let outside provocateurs try to discredit Black Lives Matter. People know that (Floyd’s death) is a legitimate crime. ""I don’t know who they are, but they are misguided if they think that rioting is going to create change. I’m in conversations with the mayor, with the president of the Board of Rabbis, with (Rhode Island Foundation President) Neil Steinberg. They all have to be part of the conversation. ""This is not a black person’s problem. We need everyone to be part of the solution.""

Officers moved to clear the streets of protesters who remained out past a citywide curfew when they arrested Martínez Contreras. He was issued a summons for failing to obey an order to disperse and was released from police custody early Tuesday morning.

In a video apparently recorded in a police transport vehicle while still at the Merle Hay Mall and then posted on Twitter, Sahouri said police sprayed her in the face with pepper spray after she identified herself as a member of the media. ""I'm press. I'm press. I'm press,"" she said she told police. KCCI earlier showed Sahouri sitting on a curb with her hands zip tied behind her back. It appeared she was wailing in pain from the pepper spray. Another reporter who was with her at the event was not arrested but shared the same account with editors before Sahouri posted her video on Twitter. Sahouri was released hours later and charged with failure to disperse and interference with official acts. On Saturday night, Branden Hunter, a reporter for the Detroit Free Press, went to an emergency room in Detroit after police administered tear gas during a protest.

""The officer redirected his chemical spray from the fleeing duo toward me."" Davis said the officer ""laid on the trigger for a few seconds"" as Davis told him he was a journalist.

Journalists covering peaceful protest in Lafayette pushed back with tear gas While several journalists were covering a peaceful protest at Lafayette Square outside the White House on Monday evening, federal law enforcement cleared the area using tear gas and flash-bang grenades before a curfew took place in Washington, D.C.

""This is a very public apology to that team."" CNN's headquarters in Atlanta was damaged Friday by a group of protesters who fought with police and set cars afire. While police tried to keep them away from the CNN Center, demonstrators broke windows and scrawled obscene graffiti on the network's logo. Saturday night, MSNBC journalist Ali Velshi wrote on Twitter that he was ""hit in the leg by a rubber bullet"" in Minneapolis but was fine. ""State Police supported by National guard fired unprovoked into an entirely peaceful rally,"" he said. 'Fired tear gas ... at point blank range' Los Angeles Times journalist Molly Hennessy-Fiske said Saturday evening that she was at the 5th Precinct in Minneapolis with ""at least a dozen"" journalists when members of the Minnesota State Patrol advanced toward the group. She said the journalists identified themselves, but officers ""fired tear gas canisters on us at point-blank range."" Hennessy-Fiske said they asked officers where they should go to avoid dispersal tactics. ""They did not tell us where to go,"" she said. ""They did not direct us. They just fired on us."" She said she ""got hit with a rubber bullet ... maybe two."" Reuters producer Julio César Chávez said early Sunday morning that he ""was shot in the arm and the back of my neck with rubber bullets"" and his security adviser ""was shot in the face,"" though a gas mask protected him. Another Reuters photographer, Lucas Jackson, said that late Saturday night in Minneapolis a man disguised as a medic attacked him with a crowbar, breaking the camera he was using to document the protests. He was ""a white man with a Red Cross on his chest who came out of nowhere,"" Jackson said. Vice News correspondent and producer Michael Anthony Adams shared video of Minneapolis troopers approaching him and several other journalists Sunday morning at a gas station where they had taken shelter. Though he shouted ""press"" multiple times, one officer ordered him on the ground before another came and pepper sprayed him. Police had weapons trained on a group of us. We held up our press passes.

In an update a few hours later, she reported that she became ""permanently blind"" in her left eye but that she would continue to work. The Denver Post said photographer Hyoung Chang was covering a protest Thursday night in downtown Denver when police fired two pepper balls directly at him. The Las Vegas Review-Journal reported that Saturday, photographer Ellen Schmidt and freelance photographer and former Review-Journal employee Bridget Bennett were arrested while covering protests on the Strip. In Louisville early Saturday morning, protesters vandalized a car with the logo of news station WLKY on the driver side door. According to one of the station's reporters, Deni Kamper, chief photographer Paul Ahmann was attacked by a mob of protesters and thrown to the ground. Kamper posted on Twitter that Ahmann was ""being treated but is also ok."" The previous day in Louisville, WAVE 3 News reporter Kaitlin Rust and photojournalist James Dobson were struck by pepper balls fired at them by a Louisville Metro Police Department officer. WAVE 3 news issued a statement to ""strongly condemn the actions of the LMPD officer."" In Phoenix, a protester charged and made contact with CBS 5 and 3TV reporter Briana Whitney Saturday night outside Police Department headquarters. The Pittsburgh Public Safety Department said Sunday that three journalists were injured by protesters. KDKA photojournalist Ian Smith tweeted Saturday evening that he “was attacked by protestors downtown” and that he was “bruised and bloody but alive.” He said his camera was destroyed, but “another group of protesters” pulled him to safety.

James Manni said. “These were not protesters.

Thousands of people demonstrating, violent clashes between police officers and protesters, beatings, tear gassing, fires, explosions, and unconscionable looting. Chaos everywhere you looked. The reasons: police brutality, social injustice and government policies. This was May, all right. But it was May 1972, 48 years ago in Minneapolis. I was there as a young TV reporter covering it all, and horror-struck by the incomprehensible atrocities I was seeing and reporting on. In watching the current Minneapolis firestorm explode, I was suddenly taken way back to 1972 for what Minnesotans called ""8 days in May."" I was a rookie 27-year-old reporter at KSTP-TV in Minneapolis-St. Paul. I had covered protests of all varieties in St. Louis and in Minnesota -- but never anything like this. In the middle of this tug of war between outraged protesters and riot-equipped police were videographers and reporters like me. We were not on anyone’s side, just doing our jobs, but at life-threatening risk. It was horrifying. In a violent protest, there are no sidelines, rules or scripts. You may get trampled, beaten up, or even killed by being in the wrong place at the wrong time. KSTP-TV videographer George Welles and I were sandwiched suddenly between the surging protesters and an imposing line of officers. In a flash, George was on the ground, with me pulling him up to safety. No one offered help. Ironically, George had no recollection of this incident until I recently sent him this 48-year-old newspaper picture from my files. I remember it clearly, having covered the Minneapolis riots the entire eight days and produced a prime-time special in an effort to quell the violence. The University of Minnesota siege was the worst rioting in the city’s history, until this past week. My memory is vivid, having been gassed, intentionally, by the Minneapolis police officers. Many of them saw us as ""the enemy,"" believing if we weren’t covering the protests, there wouldn’t be any. They knew the tear gas would burn our eyes, temporarily blind and disorient us, and disable us from shooting video for a half-hour. The officers knew we couldn’t identify them since riot gear shields their faces. They also stretched black tape over their badges to conceal their badge numbers. The protesters also hated us in many ways. They knew our video would be subpoenaed by police and prosecutors, and used to identify them for arrest and prosecution. In one instance, the protesters used a battering ram to break into the university’s ROTC building and set it on fire. We began shooting the break-in with hundreds around us. Then, several protesters cleverly distracted us and secretly smeared petroleum jelly over the camera lens to blur our next video. This is part of covering riots and disturbances most viewers are unaware of. But it comes with the territory. In seeing the past week’s riots, fueled by many of the same issues that instigated the ’60s and ’70s riots, I question how far we have come as a nation, and what a long journey we still have ahead.

Gina M. Raimondo on Tuesday activated the Rhode Island National Guard and local mayors announced curfews in anticipation of another night of possible rioting. Providence Mayor Jorge O. Elorza implemented a citywide curfew effective tonight, from 9:00 p.m.-6 p.m., until June 9th. Cranston officials said the city will impose an 8 p.m. curfew until 5 a.m. Wednesday. Garden City Center announced via Facebook that all stores and restaurants were closing at 4 p.m. due to the potential threat of violence from additional rioting, which began in Providence late Monday night. Warwick officials also announced a curfew from 8:00 p.m. this evening to 5:00 a.m. on Wednesday. - Advertisement - Raimondo said she is ready to deploy “hundreds” of National Guard members in order to protect the Ocean State. When asked by a reporter if she regretted not deploying the National Guard sooner, Raimondo said no, adding the state was already prepared on Monday for protests and possible rioting with the R.I. State Police, Providence Police and law enforcement from neighboring Massachusetts assisting. “They were able to contain what could have been an utter catastrophe,” Raimondo said. “You would have seen a much-worse situation. They came here to blow up the Providence Place mall. They came here to torch the Statehouse. … and [those things] didn’t happen because we were prepared.” Raimondo also said the state is still investigating who the group of rioters were and what their motivations were. She added the state will increase its security presence in response to concerns related to a “big demonstration” planned on June 5, but she didn’t provide details. Elorza at a press conference reiterated earlier comments distinguishing those responsible for Monday night’s violence from peaceful demonstrators protesting the death of George Floyd. “Their intentions were from the very beginning to make trouble,” Elorza said. “We cannot have what happened last night happen again.” Still, Elorza lauded first responders, including police officers and community members, for preventing what could have been far more extensive damage to the community and businesses. “Our police department, they were professionals as they were getting pelted with bricks, bottles and insults,” he said. First responders, essential workers, the homeless, news media and those seeking medical care are exempt from the curfew. While the executive order gives legal authority to impose fines and other penalties for those who violate it, that is not planned unless absolutely necessary, according to Public Safety Commissioner Steven Pare. The ACLU of Rhode Island and Common Cause Rhode Island on Tuesday both opposed the curfews, specifically citing potential problems with the state’s presidential primary, slated for the same day. Although the primary was primarily conducted via advanced, mail-in ballots, limited polling places were open Tuesday until 8 p.m. – the same time curfews in Cranston and Warwick begin. Post-voting transport of ballots to the R.I. Board of Elections site in Cranston could also be problematic, they said. “The image of a vehicle delivering election ballots being stopped and detained late at night by any police department is not a comforting one to contemplate,” the ACLU said in a statement. The two groups are urging Cranston Mayor Allan Fung to delay the city curfew start time so as not to interfere with voting or ballot processing, or, alternatively, to specifically exempt voters and election workers from the curfew. The ACLU also cited inconsistencies across the three city policies, which exempt different classes of workers, among other differences. (ADDS last five paragraphs with opposition to curfews.)",0.0

Michele Fontes, wearing an ""I Can’t Breathe"" face mask, walked through downtown with three boxes of doughnuts from Dunkin’ in her arms. She’d gone to bed the night before worried about what was happening in Providence as rumors of riots and looting started to swirl. When she woke up and saw the news, she was devastated. Fontes felt like she had to do something, and everyone loves doughnuts, so there she was, handing them out and offering to help clean up. As downtown businesses literally picked up the pieces, they were aided by a platoon of volunteers who, battling a sense of helplessness and sorrow, came out to do whatever they could to fix things. They handed out iced coffees, doughnuts, bagels. They helped sweep broken glass from sidewalks, or scrubbed spray paint from walls. They just asked each other if they were OK. Scott Blackledge, owner of the Downcity Inn on Washington Street, described the violence overnight as like a ""war zone."" Blackledge said that at about 2 a.m., there were more than 100 people in the streets around the building. They smashed the windows of the St. Pierre’s shoe store and Blake’s Tavern downstairs, and the locksmith across the street. Police dispersed them, but they just scattered and then came back, Blackledge said. One of Blackledge’s tenants, who had just moved in Monday, was watching from a window when one person launched a two-by-four at it, Blackledge said. She was able to back away from the window before it broke through, but had to flee when someone threw an incendiary device into the downstairs shoe store. She described feeling the heat beneath her feet before escaping to safety. She was treated for smoke inhalation; the sprinkler system put out the fire, Blackledge said. Tuesday was to be a memorable day for Karen Beebe. After being closed for more than two months because of the coronavirus, she was set to reopen her side-by-side shops on Westminster Street: Queen of Hearts and Modern Love. Then her phone rang at 3 a.m. ""It was the alarm company,"" she said at her shop later Tuesday. ""Usually it’s a false alarm, but I knew it wasn’t this time."" She described what happened next: ""I watched this live from my surveillance."" Looters broke a large window, knocked over merchandise racks just inside the window, ran in and grabbed the store’s computer. As Beebe watched remotely, she said, her thoughts were not so much about her store. ""I just was hoping that everybody would be safe and nobody would get hurt,"" she said. ""I just wish that people’s voices could be heard without violence."" As for the future, ""I’m just thinking one step at a time,"" she said. ""As a business owner trying to recover from COVID is hard enough."" Will she reopen? ""Definitely,"" she said. ""With the support of one another. My phone has just been going off with an outpouring of support. I can’t be more thankful that people are so generous and came to help."" At 1:42 a.m. Tuesday, Guido Silvestri got a call from his security company telling him that the burglar alarm was going off at his skateboarder apparel shop, Civil, on Westminster Street. ""The window was smashed out and people were running away with clothing,"" he said. He had reopened just two weeks earlier from the coronavirus closure. ""I’m kind of at a loss of words right now,"" he said. ""We keep taking blows, we keep taking blows, and we weather it as best we can."" This blow, however, was somewhat softened by the army of volunteers who fanned out across downtown, including Mike Ritz, the executive director of Leadership Rhode Island, who had been preparing to lead a video conference later in the morning on what America can do to solve its racial problem. ""I’ve got a couple of hours,"" he said, adding that he had come downtown to help Beebe at Modern Love, but found her store chock full of volunteers. ""Never done this before,"" said Ritz as he scooped shards of glass from a damaged display case. Silvestre was resolute in his view of the future. ""Without a doubt, we’re going to be reopening,"" he said. ""I don’t know how long it’s going to take. We will be back in action."" On Weybosset Street, Pizza Queen owner Moussa Habchi was staring through an empty window frame where looters had dragged an ATM from his restaurant onto the sidewalk when his insurance agent called. ""We got smashed last night in the riot,"" he told her. Will he reopen even if unrest continues? ""We have no choice,"" he said. pparker@providencejournal.com (401) 277-7360 On Twitter: @projopaul With reports from staff writer Patrick Anderson",0.0

WASHINGTON — American cities erupted in violence and destruction in a seventh straight night of unrest, with several police officers shot or run over, amid boasts and threats from President Donald Trump to send in troops to ""dominate the streets."" In New York, nonviolent protests Monday night were punctuated by people smashing shop windows near Rockefeller Center and breaching the doors of Macy's flagship store on 34th Street, littering the pavement with broken glass. An SUV plowed into a group of officers at a demonstration in Buffalo, injuring three, including a state trooper who suffered a broken leg and a shattered pelvis. Demonstrations also broke out in such places as Philadelphia, where hundreds of protesters spilled onto a highway in the heart of the city; Atlanta, where police fired tear gas at demonstrators; and Nashville, where more than 60 National Guard members put down their riot shields at the request of peaceful protesters who had gathered in front of Tennessee's Capitol to honor George Floyd. Bystander Sean Jones, who watched as people ransacked luxury stores in New York over the weekend, said: ""People are doing this so next time, before they think about trying to kill another black person, they're going to be like, 'Damn, we don't want them out here doing this ... again.'"" The unrest in Minneapolis appeared to stabilize on the same day Floyd's brother made an impassioned plea for peace at the spot where a white police officer, Derek Chauvin, put his knee on the handcuffed black man's neck until he stopped breathing last week. Chauvin has been charged with murder. Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said Tuesday that prosecutors were working as fast as they can to determine if the three other officers at the scene should be charged, too. All four have been fired. The death toll from the unrest rose to at least nine, including two people killed in a Chicago suburb. More than 5,600 people nationwide have been arrested over the past week for such offenses as stealing, blocking highways and breaking curfew, according to a count by The Associated Press. Cities struggled to keep police in line and avoid instances of excessive force. The police chief in Louisville, Kentucky, was fired after a beloved restaurant owner was killed by police and National Guard members enforcing a curfew. In Richmond, Virginia, the police chief said officers who used tear gas on a group of peaceful protesters would be disciplined. An officer was shot shortly before midnight near the Circus Circus casino in Las Vegas. Police had no immediate word on the officer's condition. Four officers were shot in St. Louis; they were expected to recover. Trump, meanwhile, portrayed himself as a hard-nosed, law-and-order president, with police under federal command using tear gas to clear peaceful demonstrators from a park near the White House so that he could walk to a church and pose with a Bible. Emerging after two days out of public view, he threatened from the White House Rose Garden to deploy ""thousands and thousands"" of U.S. troops. The photo op at the house of worship known as the Church of the Presidents was condemned by Episcopal Bishop Mariann Edgar Budde. ""The president just used a Bible and one of the churches of my diocese as a backdrop for a message antithetical to the teachings of Jesus and everything that our church stands for,"" she said. A senior White House official said Tuesday that despite Trump's threats, the goal was to pressure governors to deploy National Guard units. The president was not rushing to use the Insurrection Act to send in the military, according to the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. For nearly a week since Floyd's death, largely peaceful protests by day have turned to chaos at night. ""We have been sitting on a powder keg for some time and it has burst,"" Philadelphia Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw said. Trump warned that if governors don't deploy the National Guard in sufficient numbers to ""dominate the streets,"" the U.S. military will step in to ""quickly solve the problem for them."" ""We have the greatest country in the world,"" the president declared. ""We're going to keep it safe."" As Trump spoke, tear gas canisters could be heard exploding. A military deployment by Trump to U.S. states would mark a stunning federal intervention rarely seen in modern American history. It drew comparisons to 1968, when Richard Nixon ran as the law-and-order candidate in the aftermath of riots following the assassination of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. Trump made little effort to address the grievances of black Americans and others outraged by Floyd's death and the scourge of police brutality, undermining what his reelection campaign had hoped would be increased appeal to African American voters. Federal law allows presidents to dispatch the military into states to suppress an insurrection or if a state is defying federal law, legal experts said. But officials in New York and other states asserted that the president does not have a unilateral right to send in troops against the will of local governments.",0.0

U.S. stock indexes are moving higher in early trading Tuesday, following broad gains in global markets as investors hope that the gradual lifting of coronavirus lockdown mandates will put economies ravaged by the outbreak on the path to recovery. The S&P 500 was up 0.4%, adding to gains from the day before. Financial, industrial and other stocks that would stand to benefit the most from a growing economy moved higher. Energy companies also rose as the price of crude oil headed higher. Bond yields were mostly higher, another sign of ebbing pessimism among investors. The modest gains have the S&P 500 on track for a three-day winning streak, extending the benchmark index's remarkable two-month rally off a steep skid in February and March as broad swaths of the U.S. economy ground to a halt due to the coronavirus pandemic. So far, Wall Street's momentum has not been derailed by the wave of daily unrest across the U.S. that began last week in Minneapolis as a protest over police brutality. Cities across the country have been rocked by violence and destruction for seven days in a row, spurring threats from the White House to send troops in to put down the unrest. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 189 points, or 0.7%, to 25,668. The Nasdaq composite was up 0.2%. Smaller company stocks had some of the biggest gains in the early going. The Russell 2000 index was up 0.8%. NASA astronauts launched into space by SpaceX on Saturday rang the opening bell from the International Space Station early Tuesday to kick off trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Stocks have now recouped most of their losses after the initial economic fallout from the coronavirus knocked the market into a breathtaking 34% skid in February and March. The S&P 500 is now down just under 10% from its all-time high in February. Investors are hoping that the worst of the recession has already passed, or will soon, as governments around the country and around the world slowly lift restrictions meant to corral the outbreak. In Europe, France's CAC 40 jumped 2.1% Tuesday as the country opened restaurants, cafes, parks and beaches and launched a contract tracing app to help keep tabs on new contagions. Germany's DAX, which had been closed Monday, caught up with previous global markets' gains and surged 3.7%. Britain's FTSE 100 added 0.9%. Markets in Asia closed broadly higher. While more countries and sectors are reopening, activity is expected to remain subdued as social distancing rules complicate plans to get back to business.

Other symbols came down elsewhere, leaving an empty pedestal and a bare flagpole. BIRMINGHAM, Ala. — The base of a massive Confederate monument in Alabama's largest city was all that remained Tuesday after crews dismantled the towering obelisk and trucked it away in pieces. Other symbols came down elsewhere, leaving an empty pedestal and a bare flagpole. Workers hired by the city of Birmingham began removing the top portion of the 115-year-old monument from Linn Park late Monday. By daybreak, the pedestal was the only thing left, covered with graffiti and pock marks from protests against police brutality. Sarah Collins Rudolph, whose sister Addie Mae Collins died in a racist church bombing that killed three other black girls in the city in 1963, came to see the remains. She lowered a protective face mask to take in the sight. ""I'm glad it's been removed because it has been so long. It's a hate monument,"" said Rudolph. She was seriously injured in the blast at 16th Street Baptist Church, and testified against Ku Klux Klansmen who were convicted in the killings. Confederate symbols across the South have been targeted for vandalism during demonstrations sparked by the death in police custody of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Now even some of their longtime defenders have decided to remove them. In Alexandria, Virginia, it was the United Daughters of the Confederacy that took action early Tuesday, removing the statue of a soldier gazing south from Old Town since 1889. And outside Tampa, Florida, a Sons of Confederate Veterans chapter lowered a huge Confederate battle flag that has long been flown in view of two interstate highways. Birmingham finally took action about a day after protesters tried to remove the monument themselves, during one of the many nationwide protests sparked by the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody. Live video from overnight showed a flatbed truck hauling off the stone pieces in the early morning hours. It's unclear where they were being taken. Crews were expected to return later Tuesday to finish the job, a city official said. The monument had been the subject of a protracted court battle between the city and state. Alabama authorities said Birmingham would face a $25,000 assessment for violating a state law that bans the removal of such monuments. Mayor Randall Woodfin said the fine would be much more affordable than the cost of continued unrest in the city. Work to remove the monument began on Monday, which happened to be Alabama's holiday honoring Confederate President Jefferson Davis, who was sworn in on the steps of the state Capitol in Montgomery. There, on the same day, someone knocked over a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee outside a mostly black high school named for him, news outlets reported. In Alexandria, a city spokesman said the United Daughters of the Confederacy informed the city on Monday that it would remove the statue, and the city's only role was to provide traffic support. By morning, the pedestal was all that was left. City officials were not told where the statue was taken. Titled ""Appomattox,"" it depicts a solitary Confederate soldier, his head bowed slightly. In 1890, a state law was passed barring local officials from ever removing it. That law was repealed earlier this year. Alexandria Mayor Justin Wilson tweeted photos of the removal on Tuesday, saying ""Alexandria, like all great cities, is constantly changing and evolving.""",0.0

Trump and First Lady Melania Trump traveled across town Tuesday for a brief visit to Saint John Paul II National Shrine adjacent to The Catholic University of America. The shrine is a place of prayer for Catholics but welcomes people of all faiths. The Trumps posed for photos in front of a statue of Saint Pope John Paul II outside the shrine and stood silently for a few minutes, hands clasped in front of them. They did not make remarks. Washington Archbishop Wilton D. Gregory slammed the presidential visit in a statement shortly before the Trumps' arrival. “I find it baffling that and reprehensible that any Catholic facility would allow itself to be so egregiously misused and manipulated in a fashion that violates our religious principles, which call us to defend the rights of all people even those with whom we might disagree,” Gregory said in a statement. Trump also is scheduled to sign an executive order on international religious freedom on Tuesday. Trump's visit to the shrine comes just one day after he walked across Lafayette Park next to the White House and posed for cameras outside St. John's Episcopal Church, which suffered slight damage after it was set on fire by protesters late Sunday night. Violent protests have erupted in Washington and dozens of other cities across the country following the death of George Floyd, a black man in Minneapolis who died in the custody of police. Former police officer Derrick Chauvin has been charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter in Floyd's death. Critics hammered Trump because police used tear gas and shields on protesters in Lafayette Park, essentially clearing a path for the president to walk to the historic building known as the church of presidents. The show of force came roughly half an hour before a 7 p.m. curfew was to take effect in Washington. ""Tear-gassing peaceful protesters without provocation just so that the President could pose for photos outside a church dishonors every value that faith teaches us,"" said a joint statement from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, said in a speech Tuesday in Philadelphia that the St. John's event proves Trump is ""more interested in serving the passions of his base."" ""When peaceful protesters are dispersed by the order of the president from the doorstep of the people’s house, the White House – using tear gas and flash grenades – in order to stage a photo op at a noble church, we can be forgiven for believing that the president is more interested in power than in principle,"" Biden said. Church officials protested that Trump did not call them about his plans to visit to St. John's on Monday. Mariann E. Budde, bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Washington, which includes St. John’s Episcopal Church, told CNN she was outraged by the use of tear gas to get people out of the way for a photo op. ""The president just used a Bible, the most sacred text of the Judeo-Christian tradition, and one of the churches of my diocese, without permission, as a backdrop for a message antithetical to the teachings of Jesus and everything that our churches stand for,"" she said. Bishop Gregory noted that Saint Pope John Paul II was “an ardent defender of the rights and dignity of human beings"" and ""certainly would not condone the use of tear gas and other deterrents to silence, scatter or intimidate them for a photo opportunity in front of a place of worship and peace."" White House officials said Trump did want to pay his respects to St. John's, which suffered a basement fire during protests Sunday. The president also wanted to leave the White House grounds to prove he was not “in the bunker“ because of the protesters, said one official who requested anonymity to discuss the president’s communications strategy. The president was particularly angry when word got out that the Secret Service escorted him to the bunker of the White House during protests just beyond the gates of the executive mansion on Friday, the official said. After the St. John's visit, the White House put out a statement saying protesters had been repeatedly warned to exit the park ahead of the 7 p.m. curfew. “The perimeter was expanded to help enforce the 7 p.m.curfew in the same area where rioters attempted to burn down one of our nation’s most historic churches the night before,"" spokesman Judd Deere. ""Protesters were given three warnings by the U.S. Park Police."" In a morning tweet less than two hours before his visit to the shrine,Trump took credit for crackdowns in Washington – and Minneapolis. ""D.C. had no problems last night,"" he said. ""Many arrests. Great job done by all. Overwhelming force. Domination. Likewise, Minneapolis was great (thank you President Trump!)."" A couple hundred peaceful protesters gathered down the street from the national shrine ahead of Trump’s arrival, holding up signs and chanting ""no justice, no peace"" and ""black lives matter."" Police on the scene wore baseball caps and vests, but not riot gear. As Trump's motorcade arrived, some protesters shouted expletives, and others raised their middle finger. Kathy Warner, a 77-year-old retired teacher, said she was there to honor Floyd’s memory and to protest the president. She held a sign that read ""in solidarity – RIP George Floyd – Black Lives Matter.” Warner said she hoped passing drivers would read the message and “think about the injustice done to African Americans for centuries.” Warner said she has a 49-year-old son and that her heart “hurts for moms whose sons can’t reach that age.” She called Trump’s visit to St. John’s on Monday “obscene” for the way he “poses with the Bible.” Some drivers honked in support as they passed by and shook their fists out their car windows. The shrine to the late Pope John Paul II sits on the site of the former John Paul II Cultural Center, which the Knights of Columbus bought in 2011. The lay Catholic organization established it as a shrine to John Paul and added a permanent museum exhibit about his life. Daily masses are held at the shrine, which is a destination for Catholic pilgrims. The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops declared it a national shrine on March 14, 2014, after John Paul was canonized as a saint. ""It is meant to be a place of genuine encounter with God that leads to a renewal of individuals, families, societies, and cultures,"" reads the shrine's official website, adding it is a place where God ""heals and renews every dimension of human life.""

PARIS — Thousands of French protesters defied a virus-related police ban and rallied Tuesday against racial injustice and heavy-handed police tactics, as global outrage over what happened to George Floyd in the United States kindled frustrations across borders and continents. Clapping, cheering and waving signs reading ""Black Lives Matter"" and ""Police Everywhere, Justice Nowhere,"" the largely young, multiracial crowd streamed to the main Paris courthouse and rallied peacefully while police monitored closely from nearby corners. Earlier, thousands marched in Sydney, Australia's largest city, chanting ""I can't breathe,"" and expressions of anger erupted in multiple languages on social networks, with thousands of Swedes joining an online protest and others speaking out under the banner of #BlackOutTuesday. Diplomatic ire percolated too, with the European Union's top foreign policy official saying the bloc was ""shocked and appalled"" by Floyd's death. As protests escalated worldwide, solidarity with U.S. demonstrators increasingly mixed with local worries. ""When you refuse to treat the problem of racism ... it leads to what we see in the United States,"" said Dominique Sopo, head of French activist group SOS Racisme. ""The case of George Floyd echoes what we fear in France."" Floyd died last week after a police officer pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes even after he stopped moving and pleading for air. The death set off protests that spread across America -- and now, beyond. Fears of the coronavirus remain close to the surface and were the reason cited by the police for banning Tuesday's protest at the main Paris courthouse. Gatherings of more than 10 people remain banned in France as part of virus confinement measures. But the Paris protest plans drew attention online, and demonstrators showed up anyway. Similar demonstrations were held in other French cities in honor of Adama Traore, who died shortly after his arrest in 2016, and in solidarity with Americans demonstrating against Floyd's death. The Traore case has become emblematic of the fight against police brutality in France. The circumstances of the death of the 24-year-old Frenchman of Malian origin are still under investigation after four years of conflicting medical reports about what happened. The lawyer for two of the three police officers involved in the arrest, Rodolphe Bosselut, said the Floyd and Traore cases ""have strictly nothing to do with each other."" Bosselut told The Associated Press that Traore's death wasn't linked with the conditions of his arrest but other factors, including a pre-existing medical condition. Traore's family says he died from asphyxiation because of police tactics -- and that his last words were ""I can't breathe."" ""I can't breathe"" were also the final words of David Dungay, a 26-year-old Aboriginal man who died in a Sydney prison in 2015 while being restrained by five guards. As 3,000 people marched peacefully through Sydney, many said they had been inspired by a mixture of sympathy for African Americans amid ongoing violent protests in the U.S. and to call for change in Australia's treatment of its indigenous population, particularly involving police. The mostly Australian crowd at the authorized demonstration also included protesters from the U.S. and elsewhere. ""I'm here for my people, and for our fallen brothers and sisters around the world,"" said Sydney indigenous woman Amanda Hill, 46, who attended the rally with her daughter and two nieces. ""What's happening in America shines a light on the situation here. It doesn't matter if it's about the treatment of black men and women from here or from another country; enough is enough,"" she said. A total of 432 indigenous Australians have died in police detention since a 1991 Royal Commission — Australia's highest level of official inquiry — into Aboriginal deaths in custody, according to The Guardian newspaper. Australia has also never signed a treaty with the country's indigenous population, who suffer higher-than-average rates of infant mortality and poor health, plus shorter life expectancy and lower levels of education and employment than white Australians. Another protest was planned Tuesday in the Dutch capital The Hague, and more than 6,000 people attended a Sweden-organized online protest to express support with the Black Lives Matter movement. Among speakers was Aysha Jones, a Gambia-born and Sweden-based activist and fashion blogger. Jones said the protest was important to show support to people in America, but also to remind Swedes that racism ""does exist here, it's very real and people are being harmed from it."" More protests in various countries are planned later in the week, including a string of demonstrations in front of U.S. embassies on Saturday. The drama unfolding in the U.S. drew increasing diplomatic concern. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell's remarks in Brussels were the strongest to come out of the 27-nation bloc, saying Floyd's death was a result of an abuse of power. Borrell told reporters that ""like the people of the United States, we are shocked and appalled by the death of George Floyd."" He underlined that Europeans ""support the right to peaceful protest, and also we condemn violence and racism of any kind, and for sure, we call for a de-escalation of tensions."" German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said peaceful protests in the U.S. following Floyd's death are ""understandable and more than legitimate."" ""I can only express my hope that the peaceful protests do not continue to lead to violence, but even more express the hope that these protests have an effect in the United States,"" Maas said. More African leaders are speaking up over the killing of Floyd. ""It cannot be right that, in the 21st century, the United States, this great bastion of democracy, continues to grapple with the problem of systemic racism,"" Ghana President Nana Akufo-Addo said in a statement, adding that black people the world over are shocked and distraught. Kenyan opposition leader and former Prime Minister Raila Odinga offered a prayer for the U.S., ""that there be justice and freedom for all human beings who call America their country."" Like some in Africa who have spoken out, Odinga also noted troubles at home, saying the judging of people by character instead of skin color ""is a dream we in Africa, too, owe our citizens.""",0.0

She’d gone to bed the night before, worried about what was happening in Providence as rumors of riots and looting started to swirl. When she woke up and saw the news, she was devastated. She’d attended the overwhelmingly peaceful Black Lives Matter protests Saturday over the killing of George Floyd by police in Minneapolis. And now as she walked down the street before 8 a.m. she was seeing the complete opposite of the beauty she’d witnessed over the weekend: broken glass, a torched shoe store, shopkeepers shaking their heads in disbelief. “The protest Saturday was so peaceful and so powerful,” said Fontes, who works for the community organization AS220 Youth. She began to cry. A stranger drove by, saw her, and told her to keep her head up. “I’m just heartbroken,” she said. Fontes felt like she had to do something, and everyone loves doughnuts, so there she was, handing them out and offering to help clean up. As downtown businesses recovered from the rioting and looting overnight, they were aided by a platoon of volunteers who, battling a sense of helplessness and sorrow, came out to do whatever they could to fix things. They handed out iced coffees, doughnuts, bagels. They helped sweep broken glass from sidewalks, or scrubbed spray paint from walls. They just asked each other if they were OK. There were enough helpers that even the helpers had helpers: Devyn Amaral saw Fontes walking down the street and asked if she needed a hand. Fontes said she wasn’t a store owner, but sure, she could hand out doughnuts with her. It had already been a long morning for Amaral: She’d worked an eight-hour shift as a neonatal intensive care unit nurse at Women & Infants Hospital. Instead of heading home to Coventry, she went right downtown, and walked up and down the streets in her scrubs with some of Fontes’s Dunkin’, handing them out to whoever wanted one. “I get it. Everyone is angry,” she said. “But what message are we sending by destroying these people’s businesses?” These businesses have been shuttered by the coronavirus. They were just starting to get hopeful about opening up. Now this. “These people didn’t do anything,” Amaral said. She’s supportive of the peaceful protests over George Floyd’s killing. That same impulse to do something positive had inspired her to come out Tuesday morning to help repair the damage from the unrest overnight. “If there’s going to be any change, the only way to do it is to step up,” she said. Scott Blackledge, the owner of the Downcity Inn on Washington Street, described the violence overnight as like a “war zone.” “I’ve never seen anything like it in my life,” he said, standing in front of his apartment-hotel. Blackledge said that at about 2 a.m., there were more than 100 people in the streets around the building. They smashed the windows of the St. Pierre’s shoe store and Blake’s Tavern downstairs, and the locksmith across the street. Police dispersed them, but they just scattered and then came back, Blackledge said. One of Blackledge’s tenants, who had just moved in Monday, was watching from a window when one person launched a two-by-four at it, Blackledge said. She was able to back away from the window before it hurtled through, but had to flee when someone threw an incendiary device in the downstairs shoe store. She described feeling the heat beneath her feet before escaping to safety. She was treated for smoke inhalation; the sprinkler system put out the fire, Blackledge said. People in the crowd eventually saw him, learned he’d called the police, and tried to attack him, he said. He had to rush back into his building and barricade himself inside. As Blackledge described the scene for a reporter, three other people came up offering a carb-heavy snack. Jasmin Resto, Zakerra Brooks and Malcolm Jones were holding several fragrant bags from Providence Bagel and handing them out to whoever wanted them. Resto was so upset she hadn’t slept all night. “It’s not what this city is about,” she said. Jones, who lives in Riverside and attended Saturday’s peaceful rally, called what happened overnight into Tuesday “disgusting.” “This was senseless violence,” he said. “In times like these, we all need to stick together.” bamaral@providencejournal.com (401) 277-7615 On Twitter: bamaral44",0.0

In his role as coach, Stevens has witnessed Brown go from a 19-year-old who was drafted after one season of playing in college to a 20-point scorer in the NBA. Off the court, Stevens has seen Brown become a leader who is unafraid of using his voice to address important issues in society. So when Brown told his coach last Thursday that he was going to drive to Atlanta and help lead a Sunday protest over the killing of George Floyd, Stevens was hardly surprised. ""Jaylen’s greatest impact, as good as he is at basketball, won’t be in basketball,’’ said Stevens during a Tuesday morning video conference with the media. ""I just think he’s a special guy. He’s a special leader. He’s smart, but he has courage. He’s got a lot of great stuff to him. ""I think we recognized that when we drafted him, but he has been even more unbelievable every day, every year. I’ve always personally really enjoyed listening to him and talking to him about things outside of basketball. He told me he was going down there on Thursday and I certainly am not surprised by him taking a leadership role. That’s who he is.’’ Brown was joined by Indiana Pacers guard Malcolm Brogdon at the rally in Atlanta, not far from Brown’s hometown of Marietta, Georgia. After driving 15 hours from Boston to Atlanta, Brown marched in a large crowd to protest the death of Floyd, who died while pinned to the ground by the knee of Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin. While Brown was in Georgia, teammates Marcus Smart, Enes Kanter and Vincent Poirier were in Boston participating in a protest. ""I don’t think it’s a great surprise that our guys are able to lead with such great courage,’’ said Stevens, ""because they put themselves out there every day in kind of a meaningless game when you think about it. ""I’ve said this many times. I think the NBA’s amazing and I think our players are amazing. We’re lucky that we have such great people representing us with the Celtics. I couldn’t be more proud to be in the NBA, to be with the Celtics and be surrounded by the people I get to go to work with every day.’’ The NBA is getting close to making plans to restart the season, perhaps in late July, and Celtics players started showing up at the Auerbach Center on Monday for voluntary workouts. But Stevens said the focus is not on basketball with everything that is going on in the country, including the protests and the violence that has erupted after the death of Floyd. Stevens said that he wrote to his players over the weekend. ""Extreme sadness,’’ said Stevens. ""A lot of people feel the pain and it transfers to anger. I wrote a letter to our guys this weekend. It took me a while to put down exactly what I wanted to say. ""I think the thing I wanted them to know is that every decent person is hurting. Every decent person feels the pain of the African-American community. But I also don’t want to pretend I know the exact distinct pain. What I wanted them to know is I’m with them.’’ There are 11 African-American players on the Celtics 15-man roster, and Stevens said that he knows the responsibility he has in these difficult times. ""We were on a coaches call with all 30 coaches the other day,’’ said Stevens. ""One thing I heard from a number of coaches was that as white coaches, we have a lot of responsibility here. ""We may not be able to know the depth of the pain of our colleagues that are black, or our players that are black, our assistants that our black. But we have a responsibility to be not only empathetic but help drive change. ""We have all been in these conversations before and you’re moved to drive change and sometimes actionable steps lead to what you think is progress, but this sure doesn’t look like progress.’’ Stevens said that he sat in meetings with Celtics players four years ago when NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick was kneeling during the national anthem to protest social injustice. ""From those three weeks of training camp, being able to sit in those meetings, being able to listen to our guys, I think that gave me a whole new understanding of just how much change is needed,’’ said Stevens. ""At that time as an organization, we tried to make sure we were trying to do our part to create actionable steps. But there’s no question everybody’s got to do more. ""The pain everybody feels has been there for a long, long time. The lack of progress is too jarring.’’ jfenton@enterprisenews.com On Twitter at @JFenton_ent",0.0

(AP/WPRI) — As demonstrators flooded streets across America to decry the killing of George Floyd, public health experts watched in alarm — the close proximity of protesters and their failures in many cases to wear masks, along with the police using tear gas, could fuel new transmissions of the coronavirus. Many of the protests broke out in places where the virus is still circulating widely in the population. In fact, an Associated Press review found that demonstrations have taken place in every one of the 25 U.S. communities with the highest concentrations of new cases. Some have seen major protests over multiple days, including Minneapolis-St. Paul, Chicago, Washington, D.C., and Los Angeles. The protests have come just as communities across the nation loosen restrictions on businesses and public life that have helped slow the spread of the virus, deepening concern that the two factors taken together could create a national resurgence in cases. Dr. Nicole Alexander-Scott, Director of the Rhode Island Department of Health, said Tuesday that while people have the right to protest, they need to be aware of the public health risks. “The closer you are together, without a mask for a longer period of time, and particularly indoors, the more dangerous it is,” Alexander-Scott said. Now health leaders are playing the waiting game to see if a resurgence in cases will come after two large events in Providence; a peaceful protest last Saturday, and a riot Monday night. “It would be challenging to tell if we were to have an increase in cases, is it just because of the protests, or is it because of the reopening,” Alexander-Scott said. Alexander-Scott has previously said the public health data would show more cases in two to three weeks time, as the virus can take up to two weeks before people could show symptoms and get tested. An uptick in cases was reported after the Easter holiday weekend, before Rhode Island lifted the stay at home order and entered Phase 1. Data shows two weeks after the holiday, hospitalizations were up by almost 100, and over 4,600 new cases were reported. The possible source: family gatherings for the holiday. Now, Governor Gina Raimondo’s team is assessing what can be done to make large gatherings, like peaceful protests, safer. The governor said this could include passing out masks and figuring out a way to do testing and contact tracing at the events. “As a nation, we have to be concerned about a rebound,” Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser warned Sunday after days of protests rocked the nation’s capital. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo bemoaned the crowds, saying that hundreds could potentially have been infected, undoing months of social distancing. A fresh outbreak in the places where protesters gathered could lead to reinstituting shutdowns. The AP’s review focused on large metro counties — the central counties within metro areas with more than 1 million people — that showed the highest rates of new cases per capita over the past 14 days. While case numbers and deaths have been trending down in several of the cities where the largest protests have occurred, the number of people in those places infected with the virus — and with the ability to spread it — remains high. And in some of the communities, such as Minneapolis, the number of people hospitalized with COVID-19 has been rising. Floyd died May 25 after a Minneapolis police officer pressed a knee into his neck for several minutes, even as he pleaded that he couldn’t breathe. Minneapolis has been ground zero for the sprawling protests, which have crossed the Mississippi River into neighboring St. Paul. The unrest has coincided with “the very worst days of the pandemic so far” in the Twin Cities metropolitan area, said Michael T. Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota. “Our ICU bed care is at its all-time high and is really on the edge,” he said. Ramsey and Hennepin counties, home to the Twin Cities, ranked seventh and eighth for the highest per capita new cases in the AP analysis. Each has seen more than 250 cases per 100,000 population in the past two weeks, together reporting nearly 2,000 new cases in the last week alone. Experts point out that other factors associated with protests could accelerate the spread of the virus. For instance, tear gas can cause people to cough and sneeze, as can the smoke from fires set by people bent on destruction. And both also prompt protesters to remove their masks. Crowding protesters who have been arrested into jail cells can also increase the risk of contagion. An AP tally found that, thus far, more than 5,600 people have been taken into custody. Protesters and police shouting at one another nose-to-nose also is raising alarms. Osterholm and other public health experts note, however, that the protests aren’t necessarily as alarming as other events that could fuel new cases because they take place outside and many people are wearing masks. In some cases, hand sanitizer also is being informally distributed. And Dr. David Eisenman, director of the Center for Public Health and Disasters at the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health, said he feared partisan forces might accuse cities of bringing fresh cases on themselves. “I’m actually more worried about how, if those spikes occur, how that information will be weaponized against the notion of protests,” he said. Eisenman called protesting an “essential activity,” possible to practice with reduced risk. He said his grown children protested in Los Angeles and are taking safety precautions now, including isolating themselves at home. They plan to get tested for COVID-19 in about a week. Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician and public health professor at George Washington University, said the hospitalizations for coronavirus in the Washington metro area have been on the decline but that she knows that could change. “There are a lot of unknowns about what happens next,” she said. Wen was the health commissioner for the city of Baltimore during the 2015 uprising after the death of Freddie Gray in police custody and said many health clinics were closed and pharmacies burned down, making it difficult for members of disadvantaged communities to access health care. It’s a concern for her now, too. “You will have compounded health issues that go beyond COVID-19,” she said. Public health experts said it will take two to three weeks to know whether the protests cause a surge in coronavirus cases. And even then, they can’t definitively tie it to the demonstrations. The unrest is happening in tandem with the reopening of gyms, hair salons, restaurants, parks and beaches. It also comes on the heels of the Memorial Day weekend, when many people attended large gatherings, so experts already were bracing for a case increase, said Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins University. In Los Angeles, barbershops and in-person dining were allowed to resume last weekend, just as protests descended into destruction and more than 1,000 people were arrested. Nearly 10,000 new cases have been reported in Los Angeles County in the past week. Hundreds of people also were arrested in Chicago, where Cook County has had among the highest per capita rates of new cases of any large county in the nation, with 283 new cases per 100,000 population in the past two weeks. “The absolute number of cases is still high. We feel good about the fact that we’ve established a decreasing incidence, but we have a ways to go,” said Dr. Ronald Hershow the director of the Division of Epidemiology and Biostatistics at the University of Illinois-Chicago. Hershow and others noted that the racial disparities laid bare by coronavirus — with communities of color bearing a disproportionate burden of infections and deaths — overlap with the issues being protested on streets across America and around the globe. “Racism kills,” Hershow said. “Sometimes that’s direct, as in the case of George Floyd. And sometimes it’s through a virus like COVID-19.” Forster reported from Berkley, Massachusetts.",0.0

His tactics were decried Tuesday by some fellow Republicans as well as his presumptive Democratic opponent. The violent dispersal of peaceful protests near the White House the night before was a potent symbol of Trump’s policing tactics and a physical manifestation of the rhetorical culture war he has stoked since before he was elected. Moments after historic Lafayette Park was cleared, Trump walked across to pose with a Bible in front of a church damaged by fire during protests the previous evening. “D.C. had no problems last night. Many arrests. Great job done by all. Overwhelming force. Domination,” Trump tweeted Tuesday, after a night in which heavily armed military forces and federal officers swarmed the city. Trump added: “(thank you President Trump!).” The president wanted to make the aggressive action in the nation’s capital — where he wields disproportionate powers — an example for the rest of the country, a senior White House official said Tuesday, speaking on condition of anonymity because the official was not authorized to discuss internal thinking. Trump hoped his personal walk to the church, after federal officials dispersed protesters, would send a message about how dominant force could restore law and order. The president has threatened that if states do not take tough enough action, he will deploy active duty military across the country to quell unrest in the wake of the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. “SILENT MAJORITY!” Trump tweeted Tuesday, embracing a phrase popularized by President Richard Nixon decades ago, in claiming broad support for his actions. Trump also emphasized the political importance of the moment to his supporters on Twitter and declared that “My Admin has done more for the Black Community than any President since Abraham Lincoln.” The District of Columbia’s federal status gives the president outsized authority to act, allowing him to direct the deployment of the National Guard. He authorized Attorney General William Barr to oversee a surge in the deployment of federal law enforcement officers, including the FBI’s Hostage Rescue Team and agents from the Drug Enforcement Agency. Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Gen. Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, sought to distance themselves from Monday night’s events after former military officials criticized their appearance with the president. Senior defense officials told reporters the two were not aware that the Park Police and law enforcement had made a decision to clear the square or that Trump intended to visit the church. They had been in Washington to coordinate with federal law enforcement officials but were diverted to the White House to brief Trump on military preparations, the officials said. Former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, said of Trump posing for photos holding up a Bible: “I just wish he opened it once in a while.” And D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser said of the routing of the protesters, “At no time do we think it was appropriate that people who had not violated the curfew or anything else received that treatment.” Democrats weren’t the only ones saying Trump had gone too far. “There is no right to riot, no right to destroy others’ property, and no right to throw rocks at police,” said Nebraska Republican Sen. Ben Sasse. “But there is a fundamental — a constitutional — right to protest, and I’m against clearing out a peaceful protest for a photo op that treats the Word of God as a political prop.” It was Barr who gave the order Monday afternoon for law enforcement to clear out the protest before Trump’s walk to the church and ahead of Washington’s 7 p.m. curfew. Officials said the decision to clear the park was made earlier in the day in response to violence the night before. Trump also ordered military aircraft to fly above Washington on Monday night as a “show of force,” according to two Defense Department officials. They said the U.S. military and National Guard were operating under the mission name “Operation Themis.” In Greek mythology, Themis is a titaness of divine law and order, whose symbols are the scales of justice. Execution of the order to clear the park created striking split-screen images as officers deployed pepper spray, flash bangs and mounted units to break up the peaceful protest even as Trump was in the Rose Garden saying he supported the rights of peaceful protesters. Chemical remnants still hung in the air as he walked to the church. Trump reacted to the clearing of the protesters with enthusiasm, pumping his fist at officers in the park. He’d been furious about weekend images juxtaposing the fires in the area with the darkened White House in the background, according to current and former campaign and administration officials not authorized to speak publicly about private conversations. Trump was also angry about the news coverage revealing that he had been rushed to the White House bunker during weekend protests, believing the park fires in what amounts to his extended front yard made him appear weak. But some White House and Justice Department officials privately acknowledged that Monday’s events didn’t serve the administration well. Trump on Tuesday appeared to be backing off his threat to deploy federal troops to quell unrest under the 1807 Insurrection Act. White House officials said Monday night’s events indicated that the resources already available to local governments should be able to restore order. Instead, Trump turned his Twitter fire on New York officials, including Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a frequent political sparring partner. “New York was lost to the looters, thugs, Radical Left, and all others forms of Lowlife & Scum,” Trump tweeted. “The Governor refuses to accept my offer of a dominating National Guard. NYC was ripped to pieces.” The federal government has provided all affected states with a list of National Guard resources available to them, the White House official said. The official added that Trump’s message to governors was that if they don’t use all the tools in their arsenal they shouldn’t expect a sympathetic response to any request for federal dollars to help with cleanup and recovery down. Trump, meanwhile, toured a Catholic shrine on Tuesday in his second straight religious-themed appearance after he declared himself to be the “president of law and order.” Washington Archbishop Wilton D. Gregory called it “reprehensible that any Catholic facility would allow itself to be so egregiously misused and manipulated in a fashion that violates our religious principles, which call us to defend the rights of all people even those with whom we might disagree.” On Tuesday’s drive to the shrine, Trump’s motorcade sped past National Guard members deployed around the World War II Memorial. Some onlookers along the route booed, held “black lives matter” signs or made obscene gestures as the convoy rolled past. Floyd died after a white Minneapolis police officer pinned him down and pressed Floyd’s neck with his knee as the man pleaded that he couldn’t breathe. Violent demonstrations have raged in scores of American cities, marking a level of unrest unseen for decades. Lemire reported from New York.",0.0

He said his grown children protested in Los Angeles and are taking safety precautions now, including isolating themselves at home. They plan to get tested for COVID-19 in about a week. Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician and public health professor at George Washington University, said the hospitalizations for coronavirus in the Washington metro area have been on the decline but that she knows that could change. “There are a lot of unknowns about what happens next,” she said. Wen was the health commissioner for the city of Baltimore during the 2015 uprising after the death of Freddie Gray in police custody and said many health clinics were closed and pharmacies burned down, making it difficult for members of disadvantaged communities to access health care. It’s a concern for her now, too. “You will have compounded health issues that go beyond COVID-19,” she said. Public health experts said it will take two to three weeks to know whether the protests cause a surge in coronavirus cases. And even then, they can’t definitively tie it to the demonstrations. The unrest is happening in tandem with the reopening of gyms, hair salons, restaurants, parks and beaches. It also comes on the heels of the Memorial Day weekend, when many people attended large gatherings, so experts already were bracing for a case increase, said Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins University. In Los Angeles, barbershops and in-person dining were allowed to resume last weekend, just as protests descended into destruction and more than 1,000 people were arrested. Nearly 10,000 new cases have been reported in Los Angeles County in the past week. Hundreds of people also were arrested in Chicago, where Cook County has had among the highest per capita rates of new cases of any large county in the nation, with 283 new cases per 100,000 population in the past two weeks. “The absolute number of cases is still high. We feel good about the fact that we’ve established a decreasing incidence, but we have a ways to go,” said Dr. Ronald Hershow the director of the Division of Epidemiology and Biostatistics at the University of Illinois-Chicago. Hershow and others noted that the racial disparities laid bare by coronavirus — with communities of color bearing a disproportionate burden of infections and deaths — overlap with the issues being protested on streets across America and around the globe. “Racism kills,” Hershow said. “Sometimes that’s direct, as in the case of George Floyd. And sometimes it’s through a virus like COVID-19.” Forster reported from Berkley, Massachusetts.",0.0

His tactics were decried Tuesday by some fellow Republicans as well as his presumptive Democratic opponent. The violent dispersal of peaceful protests near the White House the night before was a potent symbol of Trump’s policing tactics and a physical manifestation of the rhetorical culture war he has stoked since before he was elected. Moments after historic Lafayette Park was cleared, Trump walked across to pose with a Bible in front of a church damaged by fire during protests the previous evening. “D.C. had no problems last night. Many arrests. Great job done by all. Overwhelming force. Domination,” Trump tweeted Tuesday, after a night in which heavily armed military forces and federal officers swarmed the city. Trump added: “(thank you President Trump!).” The president wanted to make the aggressive action in the nation’s capital — where he wields disproportionate powers — an example for the rest of the country, a senior White House official said Tuesday, speaking on condition of anonymity because the official was not authorized to discuss internal thinking. Trump hoped his personal walk to the church, after federal officials dispersed protesters, would send a message about how dominant force could restore law and order. The president has threatened that if states do not take tough enough action, he will deploy active duty military across the country to quell unrest in the wake of the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. “SILENT MAJORITY!” Trump tweeted Tuesday, embracing a phrase popularized by President Richard Nixon decades ago, in claiming broad support for his actions. Trump also emphasized the political importance of the moment to his supporters on Twitter and declared that “My Admin has done more for the Black Community than any President since Abraham Lincoln.” The District of Columbia’s federal status gives the president outsized authority to act, allowing him to direct the deployment of the National Guard. He authorized Attorney General William Barr to oversee a surge in the deployment of federal law enforcement officers, including the FBI’s Hostage Rescue Team and agents from the Drug Enforcement Agency. Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Gen. Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, sought to distance themselves from Monday night’s events after former military officials criticized their appearance with the president. Senior defense officials told reporters the two were not aware that the Park Police and law enforcement had made a decision to clear the square or that Trump intended to visit the church. They had been in Washington to coordinate with federal law enforcement officials but were diverted to the White House to brief Trump on military preparations, the officials said. Former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, said of Trump posing for photos holding up a Bible: “I just wish he opened it once in a while.” And D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser said of the routing of the protesters, “At no time do we think it was appropriate that people who had not violated the curfew or anything else received that treatment.” Democrats weren’t the only ones saying Trump had gone too far. “There is no right to riot, no right to destroy others’ property, and no right to throw rocks at police,” said Nebraska Republican Sen. Ben Sasse. “But there is a fundamental — a constitutional — right to protest, and I’m against clearing out a peaceful protest for a photo op that treats the Word of God as a political prop.” It was Barr who gave the order Monday afternoon for law enforcement to clear out the protest before Trump’s walk to the church and ahead of Washington’s 7 p.m. curfew. Officials said the decision to clear the park was made earlier in the day in response to violence the night before. Trump also ordered military aircraft to fly above Washington on Monday night as a “show of force,” according to two Defense Department officials. They said the U.S. military and National Guard were operating under the mission name “Operation Themis.” In Greek mythology, Themis is a titaness of divine law and order, whose symbols are the scales of justice. Execution of the order to clear the park created striking split-screen images as officers deployed pepper spray, flash bangs and mounted units to break up the peaceful protest even as Trump was in the Rose Garden saying he supported the rights of peaceful protesters. Chemical remnants still hung in the air as he walked to the church. Trump reacted to the clearing of the protesters with enthusiasm, pumping his fist at officers in the park. He’d been furious about weekend images juxtaposing the fires in the area with the darkened White House in the background, according to current and former campaign and administration officials not authorized to speak publicly about private conversations. Trump was also angry about the news coverage revealing that he had been rushed to the White House bunker during weekend protests, believing the park fires in what amounts to his extended front yard made him appear weak. But some White House and Justice Department officials privately acknowledged that Monday’s events didn’t serve the administration well. Trump on Tuesday appeared to be backing off his threat to deploy federal troops to quell unrest under the 1807 Insurrection Act. White House officials said Monday night’s events indicated that the resources already available to local governments should be able to restore order. Instead, Trump turned his Twitter fire on New York officials, including Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a frequent political sparring partner. “New York was lost to the looters, thugs, Radical Left, and all others forms of Lowlife & Scum,” Trump tweeted. “The Governor refuses to accept my offer of a dominating National Guard. NYC was ripped to pieces.” The federal government has provided all affected states with a list of National Guard resources available to them, the White House official said. The official added that Trump’s message to governors was that if they don’t use all the tools in their arsenal they shouldn’t expect a sympathetic response to any request for federal dollars to help with cleanup and recovery down. Trump, meanwhile, toured a Catholic shrine on Tuesday in his second straight religious-themed appearance after he declared himself to be the “president of law and order.” Washington Archbishop Wilton D. Gregory called it “reprehensible that any Catholic facility would allow itself to be so egregiously misused and manipulated in a fashion that violates our religious principles, which call us to defend the rights of all people even those with whom we might disagree.” On Tuesday’s drive to the shrine, Trump’s motorcade sped past National Guard members deployed around the World War II Memorial. Some onlookers along the route booed, held “black lives matter” signs or made obscene gestures as the convoy rolled past. Floyd died after a white Minneapolis police officer pinned him down and pressed Floyd’s neck with his knee as the man pleaded that he couldn’t breathe. Violent demonstrations have raged in scores of American cities, marking a level of unrest unseen for decades. Lemire reported from New York.",0.0

French protesters took a knee and raised their fists while firefighters struggled to extinguish multiple blazes as a largely peaceful, multiracial demonstration degenerated into scattered tensions. Police said at least 20,000 people joined the demonstration, defying a virus-related ban on protests to pay homage to Floyd and Adama Traore, a French black man who died in police custody. Electric scooters and construction barriers went up in flames, and smoke stained a sign reading 'Restaurant Open' "" on the first day French cafes were allowed to open after nearly three months of virus lockdown. Chanting 'I can't breathe,' thousands marched peacefully through Australia's largest city, while thousands more demonstrated in the Dutch capital of The Hague and hundreds rallied in Tel Aviv. Expressions of anger erupted in multiple languages on social networks, with thousands of Swedes joining an online protest and others speaking out under the banner of #BlackOutTuesday. Diplomatic ire percolated too, with the European Union's top foreign policy official saying the bloc was 'shocked and appalled' by Floyd's death. Floyd died last week after a police officer pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes even after he stopped moving and pleading for air. The death set off protests that spread across America "" and now, beyond. As demonstrations escalated worldwide, solidarity with U.S. protesters increasingly mixed with local worries. 'This happened in the United States, but it happens in France, it happens everywhere,' Paris protester Xavier Dintimille said. While he said police violence seems worse in the U.S., he added, 'all blacks live this to a degree.' Fears of the coronavirus remain close to the surface and were the reason cited for banning Tuesday's protest at the main Paris courthouse, because gatherings of more than 10 people remain forbidden. But demonstrators showed up anyway. Some said police violence worsened during virus confinement in working class suburbs with large minority populations, deepening a feeling of injustice. As the Paris demonstration wound down, police fired volley after volley of tear gas and protesters threw debris. Police were less visible than usual at the city's frequent protests. Tensions also erupted at a related protest in the southern city of Marseille. The demonstrations were held in honor of Traore, who died shortly after his arrest in 2016, and in solidarity with Americans demonstrating against Floyd's death. The Traore case has become emblematic of the fight against police brutality in France. The circumstances of the death of the 24-year-old Frenchman of Malian origin are still under investigation after four years of conflicting medical reports about what happened. The lawyer for two of the three police officers involved in the arrest, Rodolphe Bosselut, said the Floyd and Traore cases 'have strictly nothing to do with each other."" Bosselut told The Associated Press that Traore's death wasn't linked with the conditions of his arrest but other factors, including a preexisting medical condition. Traore's family says he died from asphyxiation because of police tactics "" and that his last words were 'I can't breathe.' 'I can't breathe' were also the final words of David Dungay, a 26-year-old Aboriginal man who died in a Sydney prison in 2015 while being restrained by five guards. As 3,000 people marched peacefully through Sydney, many said they had been inspired by a mixture of sympathy for African Americans and to call for change in Australia's treatment of its indigenous population, particularly involving police. The mostly Australian crowd at the authorized demonstration also included protesters from the U.S. and elsewhere. 'I'm here for my people, and for our fallen brothers and sisters around the world,' said Sydney indigenous woman Amanda Hill, 46, who attended the rally with her daughter and two nieces. 'What's happening in America shines a light on the situation here."" Even as U.S. President Donald Trump fanned anger by threatening to send in troops on American protesters, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau refrained from directly criticizing him and said the protests should force awareness of racism everywhere. 'We all watch in horror and consternation what's going on in the United States,' he said after pausing 21 seconds before answering. 'But it is a time for us as Canadians to recognize that we, too, have our challenges, that black Canadians and racialized Canadians face discrimination as a lived reality every single day. There is systemic discrimination in Canada.' More protests in various countries are planned later in the week, including a string of demonstrations in front of U.S. embassies on Saturday. The drama unfolding in the U.S. drew increasing diplomatic concern. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell's remarks in Brussels were the strongest to come out of the 27-nation bloc, saying Floyd's death was a result of an abuse of power. Borrell told reporters that 'like the people of the United States, we are shocked and appalled by the death of George Floyd.' He underlined that Europeans 'support the right to peaceful protest, and also we condemn violence and racism of any kind, and for sure, we call for a de-escalation of tensions.' German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said peaceful protests in the U.S. following Floyd's death are 'understandable and more than legitimate.' 'I can only express my hope that the peaceful protests do not continue to lead to violence, but even more express the hope that these protests have an effect in the United States,' Maas said. More African leaders are speaking up over the killing of Floyd. 'It cannot be right that, in the 21st century, the United States, this great bastion of democracy, continues to grapple with the problem of systemic racism,' Ghana President Nana Akufo-Addo said in a statement, adding that black people the world over are shocked and distraught. Kenyan opposition leader and former Prime Minister Raila Odinga offered a prayer for the U.S., 'that there be justice and freedom for all human beings who call America their country.'

Biden could lock down the nomination within the next week as West Virginia and Georgia hold primaries. On Tuesday, voters across America were forced to navigate curfews, health concerns and National Guard troops "" waiting in line hours after polls closed in some cases "" after election officials dramatically reduced the number of in-person voting sites to minimize the spread of the coronavirus outbreak. Biden and President Donald Trump easily swept their respective primary contests that ranged from Maryland to Montana and featured the night's biggest prize: Pennsylvania. The two men are certain to face each other on the presidential ballot in November, yet party rules require them first to accumulate a majority of delegates in the monthslong state-by-state primary season. Trump secured the Republican presidential nomination in March. Pennsylvania, which offered Tuesday's largest trove of delegates, also represented a significant test case for Republicans and Democrats working to strengthen their operations in a premier general election battleground. Voters were forced to brave long lines in 'militarized zones' because officials consolidated the vast majority of polling places in Philadelphia to minimize health risks, according to Erin Kramer, executive director of One Pennsylvania. She noted that some polling places in African American communities are in police stations. 'Having to stand in line while police officers are entering and exiting the building on police business is not exactly how people want to spend their election day,' Kramer said. Biden was in Philadelphia earlier Tuesday to deliver remarks about the civil unrest that has erupted across the nation after the police killing of George Floyd. He didn't talk about the primary, instead focusing his attention on Trump, whom Biden blasted as 'more interested in power than in principle.' Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is not actively campaigning for the Democratic presidential nomination, having suspended his operation and endorsed Biden, but his name appeared on the ballots. On the eve of Tuesday's primaries, senior adviser Jeff Weaver encouraged progressives to vote for Sanders anyway to help maximize his influence in the direction of the Democratic Party. The comments served as a reminder that Biden may have no legitimate Democratic rivals remaining, but he must still win over skeptical activists from his party's far-left flank, who worry he's too close to the political establishment. Party unity was an afterthought this week, however, as more immediate health and safety concerns dominated the national conversation. The coronavirus death toll has surged past 100,000 nationwide, and thousands of new cases are reported each day. At the same time, several major cities, particularly Washington, D.C., and Philadelphia among those voting Tuesday, struggled to contain protests and related looting that led to thousands of arrests. Some voters said Trump's increasingly tough tone toward protesters inspired them to participate in the democratic process. Nicholas Autiello, who works in finance in Rhode Island, said he was disturbed by police driving back peaceful demonstrators near the White House on Monday. 'Last night, we have a president who is acting like a dictator,' Autiello said. 'So being able to come out here this morning and fill in a circle next to a name for someone who I know will restore honor and decency to the presidency was so important.' Political groups have had to adjust as some states move to a system that relies largely on voting by mail. They include Montana, where all 56 counties decided to vote entirely by mail, despite Trump's repeated warning against it. Voting rights watchdogs in multiple states on Tuesday expressed concerns about access to mail ballots, confusion about deadlines and a shortage of poll workers that led to long lines. 'We are in unique times, and voting is a unique challenge for people,' said Josh Schwerin, chief strategist for the pro-Democrat super PAC Priorities USA. He said that his organization and others would be watching closely on Tuesday 'to see how well it works, where issues are and where obstacles have been put in place.' Those voting Tuesday included the District of Columbia, Indiana, Maryland, Montana, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and South Dakota. Two other states holding primary elections on Tuesday, Idaho and Iowa, chose their presidential nominee early in the year. In Iowa, Republican Rep. Steve King, known nationally for controversial remarks, lost his bid to be nominated for a 10th term to state Sen. Randy Feenstra. House Republicans stripped King of his committee assignments in 2019 after comments that seemed to defend white nationalism, providing fuel for Feenstra's argument that King was no longer an effective representative for the 4th District. In a New Mexico race for an open House seat, ex-CIA operative Valerie Plame lost the Democratic primary to attorney Teresa Leger Fernandez, a professional advocate for Native American communities and voting rights issues. A first-time candidate for public office, Plame harnessed her fame as the operative whose secret identity was exposed shorty after her diplomat husband disputed U.S. intelligence used to justify the 2003 Iraq invasion. ___ Associated Press writer Rodrique Ngowi in Providence, R.I., and Terry Spencer in West Palm Beach, Fla., contributed to this report. ___ Catch up on the 2020 election campaign with AP experts on our weekly politics podcast, 'Ground Game.""",0.0

(AP) "" Some governors are rejecting President Donald Trump's request to send National Guard troops to Washington, D.C., for a massive militarized show of force in the nation's capital after several days of unrest over the death of George Floyd. Several states, including New York and Virginia, have so far rejected the request, with at least one governor citing Trump's rhetoric about using troops to 'dominate' protesters as a reason why. All of those states are led by Democrats. Meanwhile, several other states around the country are sending troops to Washington with more expected in coming days. The Trump administration has asked multiple states to send troops to Washington at the same time as the president derided many governors as 'weak' for not using the National Guard more aggressively in their own states. Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam rejected a personal appeal from Secretary of Defense Mark Esper on Monday to send thousands of the state's National Guard members to Washington D.C., the governor's office said. Northam said he was concerned that the Trump administration would misuse the troops to escalate tensions. 'I am not going to send our men and women in uniform "" a very proud National Guard "" to Washington for a photo op,' Northam said, referencing an incident Monday when police used tear gas to clear peaceful demonstrators from a park near the White House so Trump could walk to a nearby church and pose with a Bible. Trump has declared himself to be the 'president of law and order' and has vowed to deploy the U.S. military to America's own cities to quell a rise of violent protests, including ransacking stores and burning police cars. Floyd died last week after a white police officer pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes even after he stopped moving and pleading for air. The death set off protests that spread across the U.S. The president's critics say Trump is deepening divisions at a time when leadership was crucial to help unify a fractured country. Delaware Gov. John Carney's office said the state did not send troops because Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser did not request 'additional assistance,' a reason Northam also cited. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Tuesday he was unaware of any request to send New York's Guard to Washington but said he wouldn't have granted such a request because they are needed at home. Richard Azzopardi, a senior adviser to the governor, said 200 New York National Guard troops were requested and the decision to deny the request was made at an agency level that did not directly involve Cuomo. Trump has been particularly critical of how officials have handled looting and violence in New York City. 'NYC, CALL UP THE NATIONAL GUARD. The lowlifes and losers are ripping you apart,' Trump tweeted Tuesday. Democratic Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker declined to dispatch any National Guard members to Washington, while Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf said he is still evaluating the Trump administration's request. Other governors have been more receptive. Gen. Joseph Lengyel, chief of the National Guard Bureau, said almost 1,500 guardsmen were coming to Washington on Tuesday from several states and more were expected Wednesday. New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy said his state's troops were sent 'explicitly to protect federal buildings and federal monuments.' Murphy is the only Democratic governor who has sent troops so far. Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont, also a Democrat, said the Connecticut Air National Guard may provide help with transportation. Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan is sending 116 members of the National Guard to be stationed on the National Mall. Hogan spokesman Michael Ricci said they will be used in support of the D.C. National Guard and the U.S. Capitol Police and 'are not there in any law enforcement capacity.' Tennessee said it is sending 1,000 troops that should be on the ground no later than Saturday. Utah is sending approximately 200 National Guard troops. And about 445 Guardsmen left South Carolina on Tuesday afternoon bound for Washington, where the duration of their deployment was undetermined. 'When the South Carolina National Guard is activated, we are prepared to respond as long as needed,' Capt. Jessica Donnelly told The Associated Press. ___ Associated Press reporters around the U.S. contributed to this report.",0.0

(AP) "" Some governors are rejecting President Donald Trump's request to send National Guard troops to Washington, D.C., for a massive militarized show of force in the nation's capital after several days of unrest over the death of George Floyd. Several states, including New York and Virginia, have so far rejected the request, with at least one governor citing Trump's rhetoric about using troops to 'dominate' protesters as a reason why. All of those states are led by Democrats. Meanwhile, several other states around the country are sending troops to Washington with more expected in coming days. The Trump administration has asked multiple states to send troops to Washington at the same time as the president derided many governors as 'weak' for not using the National Guard more aggressively in their own states. Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam rejected a personal appeal from Secretary of Defense Mark Esper on Monday to send thousands of the state's National Guard members to Washington D.C., the governor's office said. Northam said he was concerned that the Trump administration would misuse the troops to escalate tensions. 'I am not going to send our men and women in uniform "" a very proud National Guard "" to Washington for a photo op,' Northam said, referencing an incident Monday when police used tear gas to clear peaceful demonstrators from a park near the White House so Trump could walk to a nearby church and pose with a Bible. Trump has declared himself to be the 'president of law and order' and has vowed to deploy the U.S. military to America's own cities to quell a rise of violent protests, including ransacking stores and burning police cars. Floyd died last week after a white police officer pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes even after he stopped moving and pleading for air. The death set off protests that spread across the U.S. The president's critics say Trump is deepening divisions at a time when leadership was crucial to help unify a fractured country. Delaware Gov. John Carney's office said the state did not send troops because Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser did not request 'additional assistance,' a reason Northam also cited. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Tuesday he was unaware of any request to send New York's Guard to Washington but said he wouldn't have granted such a request because they are needed at home. Richard Azzopardi, a senior adviser to the governor, said 200 New York National Guard troops were requested and the decision to deny the request was made at an agency level that did not directly involve Cuomo. Trump has been particularly critical of how officials have handled looting and violence in New York City. 'NYC, CALL UP THE NATIONAL GUARD. The lowlifes and losers are ripping you apart,' Trump tweeted Tuesday. Democratic Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker declined to dispatch any National Guard members to Washington, while Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf said he is still evaluating the Trump administration's request. Other governors have been more receptive. Gen. Joseph Lengyel, chief of the National Guard Bureau, said almost 1,500 guardsmen were coming to Washington on Tuesday from several states and more were expected Wednesday. New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy said his state's troops were sent 'explicitly to protect federal buildings and federal monuments.' Murphy is the only Democratic governor who has sent troops so far. Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont, also a Democrat, said the Connecticut Air National Guard may provide help with transportation. Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan is sending 116 members of the National Guard to be stationed on the National Mall. Hogan spokesman Michael Ricci said they will be used in support of the D.C. National Guard and the U.S. Capitol Police and 'are not there in any law enforcement capacity.' Tennessee said it is sending 1,000 troops that should be on the ground no later than Saturday. Utah is sending approximately 200 National Guard troops. And about 445 Guardsmen left South Carolina on Tuesday afternoon bound for Washington, where the duration of their deployment was undetermined.

Polls began to close Tuesday night as voters navigated curfews and health concerns in a slate of primary contests that tested the nation's ability to host elections amid dueling crises and moved Joe Biden closer to formally clinching the Democratic presidential nomination. In all, nine states and the District of Columbia held elections, including four that delayed their April contests because of the coronavirus outbreak. Biden easily won Indiana, which was the first state to begin closing polls at 7 p.m. Voting continued across Washington, D.C. and Pennsylvania, two places rocked by protests following the police killing of George Floyd. The dynamic was especially intense in Washington, where Mayor Muriel Bowser imposed a 7 p.m. curfew as law enforcement agencies and National Guard troops prepared for a fifth night of social unrest near the White House. A large fence was erected in front of the White House and military vehicles blocked some streets in downtown. While voters cast ballots from Maryland to Montana, Pennsylvania offered the day's biggest trove of delegates. The state also represented a significant test case for Republicans and Democrats working to strengthen their operations in a premier general election battleground. In-person voting numbers were down in every state as many voters were encouraged to vote by mail because of the coronavirus pandemic. Yet there were reports of long lines, particularly in minority communities in the Philadelphia area, where election officials consolidated the vast majority of polling places to minimize health risks, according to Erin Kramer, executive director of One Pennsylvania. She noted that some polling places in African American communities are in police stations. ""Having to stand in line while police officers are entering and exiting the building on police business is not exactly how people want to spend their election day,"" Kramer said. Biden was on the primary ballot in almost every state in his bid to unify Democrats behind his campaign against Trump. The former vice president is already the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, given that all his rivals have dropped out of the race, but he needs to win 89% of all delegates at stake on Tuesday to formally clinch the nomination. If he doesn't secure the needed delegates Tuesday, he has other opportunities to do so this month. Biden was in Philadelphia on Tuesday morning to deliver remarks about the civil unrest that has erupted across the nation. He didn't talk about the primary, instead focusing his attention on Trump, whom Biden blasted as ""more interested in power than in principle."" Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is not actively campaigning, having suspended his operation and endorsed Biden, but his name will appear on the ballots. On the eve of Tuesday's primaries, senior adviser Jeff Weaver encouraged progressives to vote for Sanders anyway. ""People who support Bernie Sanders and his agenda, who want to maximize the influence of progressives at the convention, should cast their vote for Bernie Sanders,"" Weaver said, reminding voters that the Vermont senator is seeking leverage to shape the party's platform and rules. The comments serve as a reminder that Biden may have no legitimate Democratic rivals remaining but must still win over skeptical activists from his party's far-left flank, who worry he's too close to the political establishment. Party unity will likely be an afterthought this week, however, as more immediate health and safety concerns dominate the national conversation. The coronavirus death toll has surged past 100,000 nationwide, and thousands of new cases are reported each day. At the same time, several major cities, including some voting Tuesday, are grappling with protests. Some voters said Trump's increasingly tough tone toward protesters inspired them to participate in the democratic process. Nicholas Autiello, who works in finance in Rhode Island, said he was disturbed by police driving back peaceful demonstrators near the White House on Monday. ""Last night, we have a president who is acting like a dictator,"" Autiello said. ""So being able to come out here this morning and fill in a circle next to a name for someone who I know will restore honor and decency to the presidency was so important."" In Washington, the mayor ordered a 7 p.m. curfew, though voting places will be open until 8 p.m. Voting has been deemed essential, and city officials say voters will not be subject to arrest if they cast ballots during the curfew. Philadelphia moved its 6 p.m. curfew back to 8:30 p.m. for Tuesday to accommodate voting. ""We are in unique times, and voting is a unique challenge for people,"" said Josh Schwerin, chief strategist for the pro-Democrat super PAC Priorities USA. He said that his organization and others will be watching closely on Tuesday ""to see how well it works, where issues are and where obstacles have been put in place."" Political groups have had to adjust as some states move to a system that relies largely on voting by mail. They include Montana, where all 56 counties decided to vote entirely by mail. Voting rights watchdogs in multiple states have expressed concerns about access to mail ballots, confusion about deadlines and a shortage of poll workers that could lead to long lines. Those voting Tuesday include the District of Columbia, Indiana, Maryland, Montana, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and South Dakota.

The 54-year-old Providence resident was taking a peaceful bike ride to clear his head. “I take them every now and then, maybe three, four nights a week,” he said. “Late night, no headphones on, just listening to the wind, get some thoughts together.” As he pedaled along Broad Street, he saw a friend of his, community activist Dewayne ""Boo"" Hackney, standing in front of Expressions Shoes, a shoe store owned by another friend. Stephens stopped to say hello. Hackney told him about the chaos unfolding in downtown Providence and that he feared their friend’s store might become a target of looting. And so the men, with no tactical gear or weapons, waited out front for the rioters to arrive. Sure enough, as the crowd, which had originally gathered outside the Providence Place mall around midnight, began to disperse, groups of people spread through the city’s neighborhoods, some of them breaking windows and wreaking havoc on local shops. Stephens said waves of people began to show up at Expressions Shoes, ranging in age from 14 to 35, sometimes in cars and sometimes on foot, with the intention of breaking into the store. With each group that appeared, Hackney and Stephens asked them, respectfully, to leave and go home. “Every one of them listened,” he said. The secret, he said, to getting rowdy young people, some of whom had just been rioting, to walk away peacefully, was the respect he said he and Hackney had been able to earn among so many youth. “We said, ‘Go sit down guys. Cut it out,’ and they looked and said, ‘Oh, that’s Boo and Bennie,’ ...and they go, ‘Yeah, we better go sit down,’” he said. “Simple respect. It is so easy to gain respect and easier to lose it.” At a news conference held Tuesday afternoon in front of Expressions Shoes to announce the institution of a citywide curfew, Mayor Jorge Elorza thanked Stephens and Hackney for their actions earlier that morning. “They took it upon themselves to do what they could to de-escalate the situation and to ask people to go home or remain peaceful,” Elorza said. “Bennie and Boo, they stood right here and put their bodies between the store and the people who were looking to loot it, and they said, ‘Not in our neighborhood.’ “This is an example of how every single person can take it upon themselves to be part of the solution,” he said. “We can all play a role.” Stephens said he understands and sympathizes with the anger people are feeling across the country. The killing of Floyd, a 46-year-old black man who died last week at the hands of police officers in Minneapolis, has sparked peaceful protests, as well as violent and destructive riots, in dozens of cities. But, Stephens said, rioting and looting is not the correct way to express anger. “It’s OK to get mad and ball your fist up,” he said. “Instead of marching regular, it’s OK to stomp when you march. That’s fine. But to actually use those boots that you’re stomping to kick a window or a door in, that’s not .. a march. It’s not. ... It’s vandalism. And it’s vandalism on things that your family members go to or need.” Many of the rioters Tuesday morning were young, and adults everywhere can help guide the youth in their communities -- beginning with earning their respect, Stephens said. “It starts with you walking down the street and you see some kids playing basketball, whatever, and you walk over there and you join in,” he said. “You see a kid with his bike and he’s on the side of the road and he’s trying to fix the pedal and you go and you help him. You join in. “Pay attention to your youth,” he said. “And they don’t have to be yours to be paid attention to.” mlist@providencejournal.com (401) 277-7121 On Twitter: @madeleine_list",0.0

(AP) "" Some governors are rejecting President Donald Trump's request to send National Guard troops to Washington, D.C., for a massive militarized show of force in the nation's capital after several days of unrest over the death of George Floyd. Several states, including New York and Virginia, have so far rejected the request, with at least one governor citing Trump's rhetoric about using troops to 'dominate' protesters as a reason why. All of those states are led by Democrats. Meanwhile, several other states around the country are sending troops to Washington with more expected in coming days. The Trump administration has asked multiple states to send troops to Washington at the same time as the president derided many governors as 'weak' for not using the National Guard more aggressively in their own states. Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam rejected a personal appeal from Secretary of Defense Mark Esper on Monday to send thousands of the state's National Guard members to Washington D.C., the governor's office said. Northam said he was concerned that the Trump administration would misuse the troops to escalate tensions. 'I am not going to send our men and women in uniform "" a very proud National Guard "" to Washington for a photo op,' Northam said, referencing an incident Monday when police used tear gas to clear peaceful demonstrators from a park near the White House so Trump could walk to a nearby church and pose with a Bible. Trump has declared himself to be the 'president of law and order' and has vowed to deploy the U.S. military to America's own cities to quell a rise of violent protests, including ransacking stores and burning police cars. Floyd died last week after a white police officer pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes even after he stopped moving and pleading for air. The death set off protests that spread across the U.S. The president's critics say Trump is deepening divisions at a time when leadership was crucial to help unify a fractured country. Delaware Gov. John Carney's office said the state did not send troops because Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser did not request 'additional assistance,' a reason Northam also cited. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Tuesday he was unaware of any request to send New York's Guard to Washington but said he wouldn't have granted such a request because they are needed at home. Richard Azzopardi, a senior adviser to the governor, said 200 New York National Guard troops were requested and the decision to deny the request was made at an agency level that did not directly involve Cuomo. Trump has been particularly critical of how officials have handled looting and violence in New York City. 'NYC, CALL UP THE NATIONAL GUARD. The lowlifes and losers are ripping you apart,' Trump tweeted Tuesday. Democratic Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker declined to dispatch any National Guard members to Washington, while Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf said he is still evaluating the Trump administration's request. Other governors have been more receptive. Gen. Joseph Lengyel, chief of the National Guard Bureau, said almost 1,500 guardsmen were coming to Washington on Tuesday from several states and more were expected Wednesday. New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy said his state's troops were sent 'explicitly to protect federal buildings and federal monuments.' Murphy is the only Democratic governor who has sent troops so far. Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont, also a Democrat, said the Connecticut Air National Guard may provide help with transportation. Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan is sending 116 members of the National Guard to be stationed on the National Mall. Hogan spokesman Michael Ricci said they will be used in support of the D.C. National Guard and the U.S. Capitol Police and 'are not there in any law enforcement capacity.' Tennessee said it is sending 1,000 troops that should be on the ground no later than Saturday. Utah is sending approximately 200 National Guard troops. And about 445 Guardsmen left South Carolina on Tuesday afternoon bound for Washington, where the duration of their deployment was undetermined. 'When the South Carolina National Guard is activated, we are prepared to respond as long as needed,' Capt. Jessica Donnelly told The Associated Press. ___ Associated Press reporters around the U.S. contributed to this report.",0.0

Trudeau has long been careful not to criticize Trump as Canada relies on the U.S. for 75 percent of exports. But Trudeau, who is usually quick to answer, paused and struggled to come up with the right words when asked about Trump calling for military action against protesters and the use of tear gas for a photo opportunity. The prime minister avoided mentioning Trump directly. 'We all watch in horror and consternation at what is going on the United States,' he said. 'It is time to pull people together.' Police violently broke up a peaceful and legal protest by several thousand people in Lafayette Park across from the White House ahead of a speech in the Rose Garden by Trump on Monday. The protesters had gathered following the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis a week earlier. Afterward, Trump strolled out of the White House gates and walked across the cleared Lafayette Park to make a surprise visit to St. John's Church. Trump, standing alone in front of cameras, raised a Bible. He didn't mention Floyd, the church or the peaceful protesters police had just cleared away. In the same question Trudeau was also asked what message he is sending if he he didn't comment about Trump's actions. 'Clearly, Trudeau was not expecting this pointed question. I think he was considering whether to respond at all, which could have been taken to mean he was not going to criticize Trump,"" said Nelson Wiseman, a political science professor at the University of Toronto. 'His comments are a criticism of Trump without naming Trump,' he said. Wiseman said Trudeau was wise not to mention Trump directly. 'Trudeau is smart enough to know that. Trump has shown that he can blow a fuse even if he isn't mentioned directly, as happened at the end of the G7,' Wiseman said. Trump vowed to make Canada pay after Trudeau said he wouldn't be bullied in trade talks at the conclusion of the G7 meeting in Quebec in 2018. Trump called Trudeau 'weak' and 'dishonest.' He threatened tariffs on cars and slapped them on steel.",0.0

Over the weekend, Trump singled out antifa as being responsible for the violent protests triggered by the killing of George Floyd, saying in a tweet: 'It's ANTIFA and the Radical Left.' 'Usually you see this when there's an interest to deflect conversations from protests to just accusing the protests of being violent, organized or having backers that are evil,'said Filippo Menczer, a professor of informatics and computer science at Indiana University.

The police aren't aware of anyone showing up at all, she added.

In Payette County, Idaho "" a rural county of 24,000 "" the calls started early Monday morning after one Facebook user said the sheriff had spotted antifa rioters in the area. The calls didn't taper off until the sheriff's office debunked the rumor on Facebook. 'It's really a small community, where our citizens know us pretty well,' said Payette County Sheriff Lt. Andy Creech. 'When the post got out there, we started getting phone calls directly.' Meanwhile, Facebook users were also warning their friends to stay clear of a shopping center in a New Jersey suburb, saying it would be the center of antifa destruction on Tuesday. But police had 'no credible information' that antifa would be present in the area, Toms River Police Department media specialist Jillian Messina said in an email. The police aren't aware of anyone showing up at all, she added. Identical Facebook and Twitter posts about busloads of antifa protesters also stumped the Sioux Falls Police Department, where officers in the South Dakota city said they didn't see any unusual bus activity in town. But the claims still spread for days ahead of a planned protest this Saturday, said Sam Clemens, a public information officer for the department. 'Everyone heard there were going to be buses of people,' Clemens said. 'It was very specific: there were three busloads.' Even the owner of a Michigan limousine business was forced to refute online rumors when two of his buses became the center of a conspiracy theory that liberal financier George Soros was funneling protesters to Milan, Michigan. Social media users widely shared a manipulated photo of his white buses, edited to show the words 'Soros Riot Dance squad' emblazoned on the sides. The buses belong to Sean Duval, the owner of local transportation company Golden Limousine International, and don't have any words printed on them. Said Duval: 'It's frustrating when people from the outside start instigating and try to turn American against American.' ___ Associated Press writers Barbara Ortutay in Oakland, Calif., Beatrice Dupuy in New York and Ali Swenson in Seattle contributed to this report.",0.0

Mayor Bill de Blasio doubled down on a citywide curfew, moving it up from 11 p.m. the night before, but rejected urging from President Donald Trump and an offer from Gov. Andrew Cuomo to bring in the National Guard. 'Everyone, time to go home so we can keep people safe,' he said on WINS-AM radio shortly after the curfew took effect. Protesters continued winding through the streets, mostly in Manhattan and Brooklyn, throughout the evening following the May 25 death of George Floyd and other recent racially charged killings. ""I'm surprised,"" said Risha Munoz, on Manhattan's Upper West Side, where at points they were greeted with cheers and horns by onlookers in building windows. 'I didn't think they were gonna let us go on, but we just kept on moving and we're not stopping."" 'Something has to break, and it's not going to be us,' said Evan Kutcher, one of hundreds of demonstrators who stood outside the Barclays Center chanting Floyd's name Tuesday evening. Police began making arrests around 9 p.m. and shut down parts of the West Side Highway in lower Manhattan, blocking it off to huge crowds of protesters. The police department announced it would not allow vehicle traffic south of 96th Street in Manhattan after curfew, though residents, essential workers, buses and truck deliveries were exempt. 'We're going to have a tough few days. We're going to beat it back,' de Blasio, a Democrat, said in announcing that the 8 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew would remain through Sunday. Jane Rossi said she witnessed officers rip a man out of his car and arrest him in Chelsea around 10:45 p.m. The car was behind a group of several hundred protesters that had roamed Manhattan peacefully since leaving Trump Tower at 8 p.m. Tensions had risen moments earlier when some in the group began trying to damage a bike rental station and banged on the windows of a JCPenny's. The vast majority of the crowd moved to stop the them. Officers surrounded the car and arrested the driver moments later. 'They were just driving behind the protesters making sure that we were safe,' Rossi said. 'They were part of the protest.' Protests continued in New York City and across the country Tuesday following the death of Floyd, a black man who died on May 25 after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed a knee on Floyd's neck even after he stopped moving and pleading for air. While de Blasio insisted the city would put a stop to the violence and vandalism that have marred largely peaceful mass demonstrations surrounding Floyd's death, both the Republican president and the Democratic governor laid into the city's handling of the mayhem thus far. 'The NYPD and the mayor did not do their job last night,' Cuomo said at a briefing in Albany. 'Look at the videos. It was a disgrace.' He said the mayor was underestimating the problem and the nation's largest police force wasn't deployed in sufficient numbers, though the city had said it doubled the usual police presence. Cuomo's remarks infuriated the New York Police Department's highest-ranking uniformed member, Chief of Department Terence Monahan. Officers are 'giving their blood to keep this city safe,' he told the New York Post, adding that he'd been hit by a bike and bloodied himself while arresting suspects Monday night. Cuomo spokesman Richard Azzopardi later said the governor ""has respect and confidence in the NYPD"" and felt the mayor should put more officers on the streets. Unprompted, Cuomo brought up the possibility of using his power as governor to replace the mayor and deploy the National Guard over de Blasio's objections, then immediately shot down the idea as legally impractical and unnecessary. On Twitter, Trump urged a 7 p.m. curfew and National Guard deployment in his native city. 'The lowlifes and losers are ripping you apart. Act fast!' he wrote. But de Blasio said the NYPD was 'best equipped' to handle the lawbreaking, arguing that bringing in the National Guard risked fueling worse conflict in a city on edge. ""We will regret it if we bring outside armed forces,' he said. 'When you bring in people not trained for the circumstance but still with loaded weapons and put under horrible stress, really bad things happen.' The mayhem over the last four nights has clearly challenged the 36,000-officer police force, which has a reputation as a muscular, well-resourced agency that has driven down crime and faced down terror threats in the nation's biggest city. On Monday night and early Tuesday, police again struggled to keep up with, let alone get ahead of, roving groups of people bashing their way into shops, including Macy's flagship Manhattan store. De Blasio said officials expected problems farther downtown, as had happened the night before, and 'adjustments were made' once officials realized that the hot spots had shifted. Nearly 700 people were arrested overnight, and several officers were injured. A sergeant was struck by a hit-and-run driver in the Bronx and was hospitalized in serious but stable condition, police said.

Dorsey watched as hundreds of people gathered outside the Providence Place Mall early Tuesday morning. She said she saw people storm the mall and watched in disbelief as people torched a police cruiser. The violence stems from the death of George Floyd, a Minneapolis man who was pinned down by an officer who kneeled on his neck, despite the fact he was pleading that he couldn’t breathe. When she returned home she found it hard to process the violent scene, which she now has to explain to her 5-year-old daughter. “I’m talking to my 5-year-old when she’s watching TV and she’s wondering what’s going on,” Dorsey said. “She’s wondering ‘where are you going?’ and I explain what you see on TV is where I’m going.

Floyd died after being restrained by Minneapolis police officers. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci) WASHINGTON (AP) — Undeterred by curfews, protesters streamed back into the nation’s streets Tuesday, hours after President Donald Trump pressed governors to put down the violence set off by George Floyd’s death and demanded that New York call up the National Guard to stop the “lowlifes and losers.” As more demonstrations began taking shape around the country, and cities including Washington prepared for the possibility of more violence, the president amplified his hard-line calls of a day earlier, in which he threatened to send in the military to restore order if governors didn’t do it. “NYC, CALL UP THE NATIONAL GUARD,” he tweeted. “The lowlifes and losers are ripping you apart. Act fast!” One day after a crackdown on peaceful protesters near the White House, thousands of demonstrators massed a block away from the presidential mansion, facing law enforcement personnel standing behind a black chain-link fence. The fence was put up overnight to block access to Lafayette Park, just across the street from the White House. “Last night pushed me way over the edge,” said Jessica DeMaio, 40, of Washington, who attended a Floyd protest Tuesday for the first time. “Being here is better than being at home feeling helpless.” The crowd remained in place after the city’s 7 p.m. curfew passed, defying warnings that the response from law enforcement could be even more forceful. But the protest lacked the tension of the previous nights’ demonstrations. The crowd Tuesday was peaceful, polite even. At one point, the crowd booed when a protester climbed a light post and took down a street sign. A chant went up: “Peaceful protest!” On Monday, law enforcement officers on foot and horseback aggressively drove protesters away from Lafayette Park, clearing the way for President Donald Trump to do a photo op at nearby St. John’s Church. On Tuesday, pastors at the church prayed with demonstrators and handed out water bottles. Protests ranged across the U.S., including in New York City, Los Angeles, Miami, Houston, St. Paul, Minnesota, Columbia, South Carolina, and Orlando, Florida, where more than 1,000 people gathered in the afternoon to decry the killings of black people. “This has to change,” said 39-year-old Aisxia Batiste, an out-of-work massage therapist in Orlando. “Something has to give. We’re done. This is the beginning of the end of something. It has to be.” In New York, midtown Manhattan was pocked with battered storefronts after Monday’s protests. Macy’s flagship store was among those hit when crowds of people smashed windows and looted stores as they swept through the area. A police sergeant was hospitalized after being hit by a car in the Bronx, where people walked Tuesday between ransacked buildings and a burned-out car on the Grand Concourse, a commercial thoroughfare. Police made nearly 700 arrests and Mayor Bill de Blasio extended an 8 p.m. curfew all week. “We’re going to have a tough few days,” he warned, but added: “We’re going to beat it back.” He pleaded with community leaders to step forward and “create peace.” Thousands of protesters marched Tuesday night in a string of demonstrations across Manhattan and Brooklyn after merchants boarded up their businesses, fearing a repeat of the night before. Many people remained on the streets after the curfew hour. Police eventually ordered them to move along and began taking some into custody. More than 20,000 National Guard members have been called up in 29 states to deal with the violence. New York is not among them, and de Blasio has said he does not want the Guard. On Tuesday, Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo called what happened in the city “a disgrace.” “The NYPD and the mayor did not do their job last night,” Cuomo said at a briefing in Albany. He said the mayor underestimated the problem, and the nation’s largest police force was not deployed in sufficient numbers, though the city had said it doubled the usual police presence. Tuesday marked the eighth straight night of the protests, which began in Minneapolis, where Floyd died, and quickly spread across the country. The mother of George Floyd’s 6-year-old daughter, Gianna, said she wanted the world to know that her little girl lost a good father. “I want everybody to know that this is what those officers took,” Roxie Washington said during a Minneapolis news conference with her young daughter at her side. “I want justice for him because he was good. No matter what anybody thinks, he was good.” On Monday, scattered violence flared in multiple protests, including an officer who was shot and gravely wounded outside a Las Vegas hotel and casino, and four officers shot in St. Louis. They were expected to recover. About a dozen other deaths have been reported around the country over the past week. And nearly 8,000 people nationwide have been arrested, according to a count by The Associated Press. Some protesters framed the burgeoning movement as a necessity after a string of killings by police. “It feels like it’s just been an endless cascade of hashtags of black people dying, and it feels like nothing’s really being done by our political leaders to actually enact real change,” said Christine Ohenzuwa, 19, who attended a peaceful protest at the Minnesota state Capitol in St. Paul. “There’s always going to be a breaking point. I think right now, we’re seeing the breaking point around the country.” “I live in this state. It’s really painful to see what’s going on, but it’s also really important to understand that it’s connected to a system of racial violence,” she said. Meanwhile, governors and mayors, Republicans and Democrats alike, rejected Trump’s threat to send in the military, with some saying troops would be unnecessary and others questioning whether the government has such authority and warning that such a step would be dangerous. “Denver is not Little Rock in 1957, and Donald Trump is not President Eisenhower. This is a time for healing, for bringing people together, and the best way to protect civil rights is to move away from escalating violence,” Colorado Gov. Jared Polis and Denver Mayor Michael Hancock, both Democrats, said in a statement, referring to Eisenhower’s use of troops to enforce school desegregation in the South. A senior White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that the president is not rushing to send in the military and that his goal was to pressure governors to deploy more National Guard members. Such use of the military would mark a stunning federal intervention rarely seen in modern American history. Amid the protests, nine states and the District of Columbia held presidential primaries that moved Joe Biden closer to formally clinching the Democratic presidential nomination. Voters waited in long lines hours after polls closed, brushing up against curfews in Washington and Philadelphia, two cities rocked by protests. Also Tuesday, Minnesota opened an investigation into whether the Minneapolis Police Department has a pattern of discrimination against minorities. Floyd died May 25 after a white Minneapolis officer, Derek Chauvin, pressed his knee on the handcuffed black man’s neck for several minutes. Chauvin has been charged with murder. Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said prosecutors are working as fast as they can to determine if the three other officers at the scene should be charged too. All four have been fired.

Rourke, an African-American woman challenging Senate Majority Leader Mike McCaffrey this November, was the target of dozens of racially-charged comments during a virtual town hall last week. The violence stems from the death of George Floyd, a Minneapolis man who was pinned down by an officer who kneeled on his neck, despite the fact he was pleading that he couldn’t breathe. “It’s heartbreaking,” Rourke said of the violence that took place in Providence. “People were angry and they came – they showed their anger.” Rourke understands their frustration, but said violence is not the answer. “Destruction of property, we’ve done it, we’re still doing it,” Rourke said. “We need to come up with a different plan. They hear us, now is the time to speak and talk about it.” Members of the Rhode Island National Guard set a perimeter around both the Warwick Mall and Garden City Center for a potentially violent protest Tuesday evening after reports of “planned violence” surfaced on social media. Rourke, who lives in Warwick, said she hopes her community won’t become the next target. “People in the communities that are suffering and just like George Floyd’s family said, we have to live here,” she said. “If you are from out of state and you want to destroy your own town, you stay there, but don’t come here and destroy our town.” Rourke said the answer to real change is by voting in November and not by destroying property.",0.0

On Tuesday, Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo called what happened in the city “a disgrace.” “The NYPD and the mayor did not do their job last night,” Cuomo said at a briefing in Albany. He said the mayor underestimated the problem, and the nation’s largest police force was not deployed in sufficient numbers, though the city had said it doubled the usual police presence. Tuesday marked the eighth straight night of the protests, which began in Minneapolis, where Floyd died, and quickly spread across the country. The mother of George Floyd’s 6-year-old daughter, Gianna, said she wanted the world to know that her little girl lost a good father. “I want everybody to know that this is what those officers took,” Roxie Washington said during a Minneapolis news conference with her young daughter at her side. “I want justice for him because he was good. No matter what anybody thinks, he was good.” On Monday, scattered violence flared in multiple protests, including an officer who was shot and gravely wounded outside a Las Vegas hotel and casino, and four officers shot in St. Louis. They were expected to recover. About a dozen other deaths have been reported around the country over the past week. And nearly 8,000 people nationwide have been arrested, according to a count by The Associated Press. Some protesters framed the burgeoning movement as a necessity after a string of killings by police. “It feels like it’s just been an endless cascade of hashtags of black people dying, and it feels like nothing’s really being done by our political leaders to actually enact real change,” said Christine Ohenzuwa, 19, who attended a peaceful protest at the Minnesota state Capitol in St. Paul. “There’s always going to be a breaking point. I think right now, we’re seeing the breaking point around the country.” “I live in this state. It’s really painful to see what’s going on, but it’s also really important to understand that it’s connected to a system of racial violence,” she said. Meanwhile, governors and mayors, Republicans and Democrats alike, rejected Trump’s threat to send in the military, with some saying troops would be unnecessary and others questioning whether the government has such authority and warning that such a step would be dangerous. “Denver is not Little Rock in 1957, and Donald Trump is not President Eisenhower. This is a time for healing, for bringing people together, and the best way to protect civil rights is to move away from escalating violence,” Colorado Gov. Jared Polis and Denver Mayor Michael Hancock, both Democrats, said in a statement, referring to Eisenhower’s use of troops to enforce school desegregation in the South. A senior White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that the president is not rushing to send in the military and that his goal was to pressure governors to deploy more National Guard members. Such use of the military would mark a stunning federal intervention rarely seen in modern American history. Amid the protests, nine states and the District of Columbia held presidential primaries that moved Joe Biden closer to formally clinching the Democratic presidential nomination. Voters waited in long lines hours after polls closed, brushing up against curfews in Washington and Philadelphia, two cities rocked by protests. Also Tuesday, Minnesota opened an investigation into whether the Minneapolis Police Department has a pattern of discrimination against minorities. Floyd died May 25 after a white Minneapolis officer, Derek Chauvin, pressed his knee on the handcuffed black man’s neck for several minutes. Chauvin has been charged with murder. Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said prosecutors are working as fast as they can to determine if the three other officers at the scene should be charged too. All four have been fired. Sullivan reported from Minneapolis. Associated Press journalists across the U.S. contributed to this report.",0.0

(WPRI) ─ The looting and violence in Providence early Tuesday morning was disheartening to many, but it was especially upsetting to Rhode Island Senate candidate Jennifer Rourke. Rourke, an African-American woman challenging Senate Majority Leader Mike McCaffrey this November, was the target of dozens of racially-charged comments during a virtual town hall last week. The violence stems from the death of George Floyd, a Minneapolis man who was pinned down by an officer who kneeled on his neck, despite the fact he was pleading that he couldn’t breathe. “It’s heartbreaking,” Rourke said of the violence that took place in Providence. “People were angry and they came – they showed their anger.” Rourke understands their frustration, but said violence is not the answer. “Destruction of property, we’ve done it, we’re still doing it,” Rourke said. “We need to come up with a different plan. They hear us, now is the time to speak and talk about it.” Members of the Rhode Island National Guard set a perimeter around both the Warwick Mall and Garden City Center for a potentially violent protest Tuesday evening after reports of “planned violence” surfaced on social media. Rourke, who lives in Warwick, said she hopes her community won’t become the next target. “People in the communities that are suffering and just like George Floyd’s family said, we have to live here,” she said. “If you are from out of state and you want to destroy your own town, you stay there, but don’t come here and destroy our town.” Rourke said the answer to real change is by voting in November and not by destroying property.",0.0

The statement, issued by the city's Public Safety and Police Departments around 8 p.m. Tuesday evening, said city officials are aware of ""vast social media posts threatening violence, vandalism and harm to police and local businesses and property."" Police urged residents to remain at home and allow public safety officers to manage potentially lawless groups. ""Although the police support peaceful protest, the Woonsocket Police Department is actively preparing for and will take appropriate action if violent and destructive behavior erupts.

The warning comes one day after riots erupted in Providence, causing damage to downtown area buildings and Providence Place Mall. Several cities in Rhode Island have been warned of a second night of potential looting. Earlier in the day, business owners on Main Street boarded up windows in preparation for the potential violence. The Stadium Theatre was among the locations that boarded up windows to protect against potential looting and damage. In the same statement, the city's Public Safety Department condemned the actions of the Minneapolis police officer responsible for the death of George Floyd last week. ""The country and state is reeling from the officer-involved death of Mr. George Floyd in Minneapolis. The Woonsocket Public Safety Department, including the men and women of the Woonsocket Police Department, condemn the officer’s actions and the others who did nothing to prevent Mr. Floyd’s death,"" the statement read. ""The Woonsocket Police Department believes in the fair and impartial treatment of all its citizens and visitors alike. Woonsocket Police officers do not use or authorize procedures or tactics to induce unconsciousness as a compliance technique within the response to resistance continuum."" According to the statement, Mayor Lisa Baldelli-Hunt, Public Safety Director Eugene Jalette and Police Chief Thomas F. Oates III have refrained from implementing a city-wide curfew but are asking residents to remain home.

After the recent murder of George Floyd by the knee of a police officer and countless acts of police brutality against unarmed people of color, it’s important that we use our platform to show solidarity and support for all people of color and the Black Lives Matter movement. Here at Rhode Island Monthly, we’re going to dedicate ourselves to telling more positive stories about the community of black, indigenous and people of color (BIPOC) in the pages of our magazine and on our website. Ray Rickman, co-founder and executive director of Stages of Freedom, explains that racism is not just violent acts, it’s systemic. “This is a racist society. People see racism when a cop kills somebody by putting his [knee] on him for eight minutes and it gets videotaped,” he says. “But racism is in the culture, it’s in the government and it’s in everything. And we don’t tackle it.” One way we can tackle it is to donate to local worthy causes such as the Providence and Newport branches for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and Black Lives Matter Rhode Island, as well as Stages of Freedom, a nonprofit that helps build community by creating and providing programming and events about Black Rhode Island life and culture as well as youth access to swimming, cultural opportunities, museums and live performances. Another local group is called Thinking Black Men of Providence, a small black radio station that is also committed to the intellectual development of young black men in Rhode Island through mentoring. There are also national groups like Color of Change, the Minnesota-based Black Visions Collective and Reclaim the Block, or you can choose to donate directly to the family of George Floyd for his memorial fund or the Minnesota Freedom Fund. On a local level, you can show support by participating in a peaceful Protect Black Lives protest to support the Black Lives Matter movement, taking place on Friday, June 5 at 4:30 p.m. starting at Kennedy Plaza and Central High School. The event involves a speaking program and a march. They are requesting people wear masks and dress in all black. Another way to support people of color is to invest in their businesses and amplify their voices. Georgina Sarpong is currently collecting information to put together a more comprehensive database of black-owned businesses, but it’s still in the information-gathering phase. Please add your business here if you are interested in being listed on the site she is creating as a collaborative resource for black business owners and a platform for potential customers to search for reliable services. In the meantime, we compiled a short list of businesses you can support right now and use as a resource guide for planning events, hiring catering and marketing support and dining out and shopping. If we missed any businesses that belong on this list, please add a comment below and we will be sure to keep it updated. We also plan to interview Sarpong and promote her efforts when her database is ready to go.

Biden could lock down the nomination within the next week as West Virginia and Georgia hold primaries. On Tuesday, voters across America were forced to navigate curfews, health concerns and National Guard troops "" waiting in line hours after polls closed in some cases "" after election officials dramatically reduced the number of in-person voting sites to minimize the spread of the coronavirus outbreak. Biden and President Donald Trump easily swept their respective primary contests that ranged from Maryland to Montana and featured the night's biggest prize: Pennsylvania. The two men are certain to face each other on the presidential ballot in November, yet party rules require them first to accumulate a majority of delegates in the monthslong state-by-state primary season. Trump secured the Republican presidential nomination in March. Pennsylvania, which offered Tuesday's largest trove of delegates, also represented a significant test case for Republicans and Democrats working to strengthen their operations in a premier general election battleground. Voters were forced to brave long lines in 'militarized zones' because officials consolidated the vast majority of polling places in Philadelphia to minimize health risks, according to Erin Kramer, executive director of One Pennsylvania. She noted that some polling places in African American communities are in police stations. 'Having to stand in line while police officers are entering and exiting the building on police business is not exactly how people want to spend their election day,' Kramer said. Biden was in Philadelphia earlier Tuesday to deliver remarks about the civil unrest that has erupted across the nation after the police killing of George Floyd. He didn't talk about the primary, instead focusing his attention on Trump, whom Biden blasted as 'more interested in power than in principle.' Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is not actively campaigning for the Democratic presidential nomination, having suspended his operation and endorsed Biden, but his name appeared on the ballots. On the eve of Tuesday's primaries, senior adviser Jeff Weaver encouraged progressives to vote for Sanders anyway to help maximize his influence in the direction of the Democratic Party. The comments served as a reminder that Biden may have no legitimate Democratic rivals remaining, but he must still win over skeptical activists from his party's far-left flank, who worry he's too close to the political establishment. Party unity was an afterthought this week, however, as more immediate health and safety concerns dominated the national conversation. The coronavirus death toll has surged past 100,000 nationwide, and thousands of new cases are reported each day. At the same time, several major cities, particularly Washington, D.C., and Philadelphia among those voting Tuesday, struggled to contain protests and related looting that led to thousands of arrests. Some voters said Trump's increasingly tough tone toward protesters inspired them to participate in the democratic process. Nicholas Autiello, who works in finance in Rhode Island, said he was disturbed by police driving back peaceful demonstrators near the White House on Monday. 'Last night, we have a president who is acting like a dictator,' Autiello said. 'So being able to come out here this morning and fill in a circle next to a name for someone who I know will restore honor and decency to the presidency was so important.' Political groups have had to adjust as some states move to a system that relies largely on voting by mail. They include Montana, where all 56 counties decided to vote entirely by mail, despite Trump's repeated warning against it. Voting rights watchdogs in multiple states on Tuesday expressed concerns about access to mail ballots, confusion about deadlines and a shortage of poll workers that led to long lines. 'We are in unique times, and voting is a unique challenge for people,' said Josh Schwerin, chief strategist for the pro-Democrat super PAC Priorities USA. He said that his organization and others would be watching closely on Tuesday 'to see how well it works, where issues are and where obstacles have been put in place.' Those voting Tuesday included the District of Columbia, Indiana, Maryland, Montana, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and South Dakota. Two other states holding primary elections on Tuesday, Idaho and Iowa, chose their presidential nominee early in the year. In Iowa, Republican Rep. Steve King, known nationally for controversial remarks, lost his bid to be nominated for a 10th term to state Sen. Randy Feenstra. House Republicans stripped King of his committee assignments in 2019 after comments that seemed to defend white nationalism, providing fuel for Feenstra's argument that King was no longer an effective representative for the 4th District.

Biden could lock down the nomination within the next week as West Virginia and Georgia hold primaries. On Tuesday, voters across America were forced to navigate curfews, health concerns and National Guard troops "" waiting in line hours after polls closed in some cases "" after election officials dramatically reduced the number of in-person voting sites to minimize the spread of the coronavirus outbreak. Biden and President Donald Trump easily swept their respective primary contests that ranged from Maryland to Montana and featured the night's biggest prize: Pennsylvania. The two men are certain to face each other on the presidential ballot in November, yet party rules require them first to accumulate a majority of delegates in the monthslong state-by-state primary season. Trump secured the Republican presidential nomination in March. Pennsylvania, which offered Tuesday's largest trove of delegates, also represented a significant test case for Republicans and Democrats working to strengthen their operations in a premier general election battleground. Voters were forced to brave long lines in 'militarized zones' because officials consolidated the vast majority of polling places in Philadelphia to minimize health risks, according to Erin Kramer, executive director of One Pennsylvania. She noted that some polling places in African American communities are in police stations. 'Having to stand in line while police officers are entering and exiting the building on police business is not exactly how people want to spend their election day,' Kramer said. Biden was in Philadelphia earlier Tuesday to deliver remarks about the civil unrest that has erupted across the nation after the police killing of George Floyd. He didn't talk about the primary, instead focusing his attention on Trump, whom Biden blasted as 'more interested in power than in principle.' Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is not actively campaigning for the Democratic presidential nomination, having suspended his operation and endorsed Biden, but his name appeared on the ballots. On the eve of Tuesday's primaries, senior adviser Jeff Weaver encouraged progressives to vote for Sanders anyway to help maximize his influence in the direction of the Democratic Party. The comments served as a reminder that Biden may have no legitimate Democratic rivals remaining, but he must still win over skeptical activists from his party's far-left flank, who worry he's too close to the political establishment. Party unity was an afterthought this week, however, as more immediate health and safety concerns dominated the national conversation. The coronavirus death toll has surged past 100,000 nationwide, and thousands of new cases are reported each day. At the same time, several major cities, particularly Washington, D.C., and Philadelphia among those voting Tuesday, struggled to contain protests and related looting that led to thousands of arrests. Some voters said Trump's increasingly tough tone toward protesters inspired them to participate in the democratic process. Nicholas Autiello, who works in finance in Rhode Island, said he was disturbed by police driving back peaceful demonstrators near the White House on Monday. 'Last night, we have a president who is acting like a dictator,' Autiello said. 'So being able to come out here this morning and fill in a circle next to a name for someone who I know will restore honor and decency to the presidency was so important.' Political groups have had to adjust as some states move to a system that relies largely on voting by mail. They include Montana, where all 56 counties decided to vote entirely by mail, despite Trump's repeated warning against it. Voting rights watchdogs in multiple states on Tuesday expressed concerns about access to mail ballots, confusion about deadlines and a shortage of poll workers that led to long lines. 'We are in unique times, and voting is a unique challenge for people,' said Josh Schwerin, chief strategist for the pro-Democrat super PAC Priorities USA. He said that his organization and others would be watching closely on Tuesday 'to see how well it works, where issues are and where obstacles have been put in place.' Those voting Tuesday included the District of Columbia, Indiana, Maryland, Montana, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and South Dakota. Two other states holding primary elections on Tuesday, Idaho and Iowa, chose their presidential nominee early in the year. In Iowa, Republican Rep. Steve King, known nationally for controversial remarks, lost his bid to be nominated for a 10th term to state Sen. Randy Feenstra.

The helicopter, normally designated for use in medical evacuations, hovered low enough to create a deafening noise and spray protesters with rotor wash on Monday. The commanding general of the D.C. Guard, Maj. Gen. William Walker, said in a statement Wednesday that he directed the investigation, and officials The investigation comes as the federal government has promised to maximize its law enforcement presence in the nation's capital. Scores of heavily-armed federal officers in tactical gear have been on the district's streets for days, after demonstrators set fires, broke store windows and stole items from the shelves and left police officers injured. The Trump administration has made an effort to show a use of force in Washington. Hours before a 7 p.m. curfew on Tuesday, cars were being stopped at military checkpoints downtown, and a cavalry of armored military vehicles could be seen driving through the district. Mayor Muriel Bowser said the administration had floated the idea of taking over the Metropolitan Police Department, a proposal she strongly rejected. She threatened to take legal action if the federal government attempted to do so. Two Defense Department officials said the administration had ordered military aircraft to fly above Washington on Monday night as a 'show of force' against demonstrators. They were protesting the death of Floyd, a black man who died after a white Minneapolis policeman pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes even after Floyd stopped moving and pleading for air. Police made over 300 arrests, mainly for violating the district's curfew. Earlier Monday evening, law enforcement officers on foot and horseback moved aggressively to clear protesters away from Lafayette Park near the White House before President Donald Trump walked to a nearby church for a photo opportunity. After participating in the show of force, Arlington County in Virginia pulled out its officers, saying they were used 'for a purpose not worthy of our mutual aid obligations.' County officials said in a statement their officers never wielded their batons and did not fire rubber bullets or tear gas. After watching the scene unfold on live television, the police chief ordered all the officers to return to Virginia. Officials said they were reevaluating the mutual aid agreements to ensure officers 'are never again put in a situation where they are asked to take action that is inconsistent with our values.' The U.S. Park Police said it gave three warnings over a loudspeaker before clearing the area of protesters, some of whom authorities said were becoming violent, throwing projectiles and trying to grab weapons. The agency said it used smoke canisters and pepper balls to disperse the crowd. Attorney General William Barr ordered law enforcement to clear the park and push back the perimeter around the White House when he arrived there Monday evening, before the president's remarks, and that led to police using force to disperse protesters, a person familiar with the matter told The Associated Press. Officials had decided the perimeter had to be moved by at least one full block, after fires were set in the park the night before, the person said. When Barr arrived, he was surprised it hadn't been done and directed action to be taken, according to the person, who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. In a Monday call with governors, Trump and Barr encouraged more aggressive action against those who cause violence during protests. Trump said he was 'taking immediate presidential action to stop the violence and restore security and safety in America.' The president urged governors to deploy the National Guard, which he credited with helping calm the situation Sunday night in Minneapolis, and demanded that similarly tough measures be taken in cities that also experienced spasms of violence, including New York, Philadelphia and Los Angeles. Between the protests and the response to the coronavirus pandemic, the National Guard has been deployed at its highest level in recent history, surpassing the number of troops sent to the Gulf Coast during Hurricane Katrina in 2005. More than 66,700 soldiers and airmen have been activated "" 45,000 to assist with the pandemic and more than 17,000 to help with the protests. The Justice Department had deployed agents from every one of its agencies, including the FBI's Hostage Rescue Team, an elite tactical unit, and riot teams from the Bureau of Prisons. The Park Police and Secret Service have had dozens of officers out in riot gear in Washington for the last few nights, in addition to the Metropolitan Police Department. U.S. Customs and Border Protection and other Homeland Security agencies were also dispatched. Most of the protesters have been peaceful and tried to discourage violence. Trump, Barr and others have tried to blame some of the civil unrest on left-wing extremist groups, including antifa, and other 'anarchists.""

Mayor Muriel Bowser said the administration had floated the idea of taking over the Metropolitan Police Department, a proposal she strongly rejected. She threatened to take legal action if the federal government attempted to do so. Two Defense Department officials said the administration had ordered military aircraft to fly above Washington on Monday night as a 'show of force' against demonstrators. They were protesting the death of Floyd, a black man who died after a white Minneapolis policeman pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes even after Floyd stopped moving and pleading for air. Police made over 300 arrests, mainly for violating the district's curfew. Earlier Monday evening, law enforcement officers on foot and horseback moved aggressively to clear protesters away from Lafayette Park near the White House before President Donald Trump walked to a nearby church for a photo opportunity. After participating in the show of force, Arlington County in Virginia pulled out its officers, saying they were used 'for a purpose not worthy of our mutual aid obligations.' County officials said in a statement their officers never wielded their batons and did not fire rubber bullets or tear gas. After watching the scene unfold on live television, the police chief ordered all the officers to return to Virginia. Officials said they were reevaluating the mutual aid agreements to ensure officers 'are never again put in a situation where they are asked to take action that is inconsistent with our values.' The U.S. Park Police said it gave three warnings over a loudspeaker before clearing the area of protesters, some of whom authorities said were becoming violent, throwing projectiles and trying to grab weapons. The agency said it used smoke canisters and pepper balls to disperse the crowd. Attorney General William Barr ordered law enforcement to clear the park and push back the perimeter around the White House when he arrived there Monday evening, before the president's remarks, and that led to police using force to disperse protesters, a person familiar with the matter told The Associated Press. Officials had decided the perimeter had to be moved by at least one full block, after fires were set in the park the night before, the person said. When Barr arrived, he was surprised it hadn't been done and directed action to be taken, according to the person, who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. In a Monday call with governors, Trump and Barr encouraged more aggressive action against those who cause violence during protests. Trump said he was 'taking immediate presidential action to stop the violence and restore security and safety in America.' The president urged governors to deploy the National Guard, which he credited with helping calm the situation Sunday night in Minneapolis, and demanded that similarly tough measures be taken in cities that also experienced spasms of violence, including New York, Philadelphia and Los Angeles. Between the protests and the response to the coronavirus pandemic, the National Guard has been deployed at its highest level in recent history, surpassing the number of troops sent to the Gulf Coast during Hurricane Katrina in 2005. More than 66,700 soldiers and airmen have been activated "" 45,000 to assist with the pandemic and more than 17,000 to help with the protests. The Justice Department had deployed agents from every one of its agencies, including the FBI's Hostage Rescue Team, an elite tactical unit, and riot teams from the Bureau of Prisons. The Park Police and Secret Service have had dozens of officers out in riot gear in Washington for the last few nights, in addition to the Metropolitan Police Department. U.S. Customs and Border Protection and other Homeland Security agencies were also dispatched. Most of the protesters have been peaceful and tried to discourage violence. Trump, Barr and others have tried to blame some of the civil unrest on left-wing extremist groups, including antifa, and other 'anarchists."" Short for anti-fascists, antifa is an umbrella term for far-left-leaning militant groups that resist neo-Nazis and white supremacists at demonstrations. ___ Associated Press writers Zeke Miller, Lolita C.

Biden could lock down the nomination within the next week as West Virginia and Georgia hold primaries. On Tuesday, voters across America were forced to navigate curfews, health concerns and National Guard troops "" waiting in line hours after polls closed in some cases "" after election officials dramatically reduced the number of in-person voting sites to minimize the spread of the coronavirus outbreak. Biden and President Donald Trump easily swept their respective primary contests that ranged from Maryland to Montana and featured the night's biggest prize: Pennsylvania. The two men are certain to face each other on the presidential ballot in November, yet party rules require them first to accumulate a majority of delegates in the monthslong state-by-state primary season. Trump secured the Republican presidential nomination in March. Pennsylvania, which offered Tuesday's largest trove of delegates, also represented a significant test case for Republicans and Democrats working to strengthen their operations in a premier general election battleground. Voters were forced to brave long lines in 'militarized zones' because officials consolidated the vast majority of polling places in Philadelphia to minimize health risks, according to Erin Kramer, executive director of One Pennsylvania. She noted that some polling places in African American communities are in police stations. 'Having to stand in line while police officers are entering and exiting the building on police business is not exactly how people want to spend their Election Day,' Kramer said. Biden was in Philadelphia earlier Tuesday to deliver remarks about the civil unrest that has erupted across the nation after the police killing of George Floyd. He didn't talk about the primary, instead focusing his attention on Trump, whom Biden blasted as 'more interested in power than in principle.' Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is not actively campaigning for the Democratic presidential nomination, having suspended his operation and endorsed Biden, but his name appeared on the ballots. On the eve of Tuesday's primaries, senior adviser Jeff Weaver encouraged progressives to vote for Sanders anyway to help maximize his influence in the direction of the Democratic Party. The comments served as a reminder that Biden may have no legitimate Democratic rivals remaining but must still win over skeptical activists from his party's far-left flank, who worry he's too close to the political establishment. Party unity was an afterthought this week, however, as more immediate health and safety concerns dominated the national conversation. The coronavirus death toll has surged past 100,000 nationwide, and thousands of new cases are reported each day. At the same time, several major cities, particularly Washington, D.C., and Philadelphia among those voting Tuesday, struggled to contain protests and related looting that led to thousands of arrests. Some voters said Trump's increasingly tough tone toward protesters inspired them to participate in the democratic process. Nicholas Autiello, who works in finance in Rhode Island, said he was disturbed by police driving back peaceful demonstrators near the White House on Monday. 'Last night, we have a president who is acting like a dictator,' Autiello said. 'So being able to come out here this morning and fill in a circle next to a name for someone who I know will restore honor and decency to the presidency was so important.' Political groups have had to adjust as some states move to a system that relies largely on voting by mail. They include Montana, where all 56 counties decided to vote entirely by mail, despite Trump's repeated warning against it. Voting rights watchdogs in multiple states on Tuesday expressed concerns about access to mail ballots, confusion about deadlines and a shortage of poll workers that led to long lines. 'We are in unique times, and voting is a unique challenge for people,' said Josh Schwerin, chief strategist for the pro-Democrat super PAC Priorities USA. He said that his organization and others would be watching closely on Tuesday 'to see how well it works, where issues are and where obstacles have been put in place.' Those voting Tuesday included the District of Columbia, Indiana, Maryland, Montana, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and South Dakota. Two other states holding primary elections on Tuesday, Idaho and Iowa, chose their presidential nominee early in the year. In Iowa, Republican Rep. Steve King, known nationally for controversial remarks, lost his bid to be nominated for a 10th term to state Sen. Randy Feenstra. House Republicans stripped King of his committee assignments in 2019 after comments that seemed to defend white nationalism, providing fuel for Feenstra's argument that King was no longer an effective representative for the 4th District. In a New Mexico race for an open House seat, ex-CIA operative Valerie Plame lost the Democratic primary to attorney Teresa Leger Fernandez, a professional advocate for Native American communities and voting rights issues. A first-time candidate for public office, Plame harnessed her fame as the operative whose secret identity was exposed shorty after her diplomat husband disputed U.S. intelligence used to justify the 2003 Iraq invasion. And in Washington, Janeese Lewis George, a self-identified democratic socialist, upset incumbent Brandon Todd in the Democratic primary for a seat on the city council. Todd was an ally of Mayor Muriel Bowser, who previously held the seat. ___ Associated Press writer Rodrique Ngowi in Providence, R.I., and Terry Spencer in West Palm Beach, Fla., contributed to this report. ___ Catch up on the 2020 election campaign with AP experts on our weekly politics podcast, 'Ground Game.""",0.0

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci) MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — The nation’s streets were calmer than they have been in days since the killing of George Floyd set off mostly peaceful but sometimes violent demonstrations over police brutality and injustice against African Americans. Earlier curfews and efforts by protesters to contain the lawlessness were credited with preventing more widespread damage to businesses in New York and other cities overnight. By Wednesday morning, arrests had grown to more than 9,000 nationwide since the vandalism, arson and shootings erupted around the U.S. in reaction to Floyd’s death May 25 in Minneapolis. At least 12 deaths have been reported, though the circumstances in many cases are still being sorted out. In Washington, where authorities ordered people off streets before sundown, thousands of demonstrators massed a block from the White House on Tuesday evening, following a crackdown a day earlier when officers drove peaceful protesters away from Lafayette Park to clear the way for President Donald Trump to do a photo op with a Bible at a church. A black chain-link fence was put up to block access to the park. “Last night pushed me way over the edge,” said Jessica DeMaio, 40, of Washington, who attended a Floyd protest for the first time. “Being here is better than being at home feeling helpless.” Pastors at the church prayed with demonstrators and handed out water bottles. The crowd remained in place after the city’s 7 p.m. curfew passed, defying warnings that the response from law enforcement could be even more forceful. But the people were peaceful, even polite. At one point, the crowd booed when a protester climbed a light post and took down a street sign. A chant went up: “Peaceful protest!” Pope Francis called for national reconciliation and peace, saying he has ‘’witnessed with great concern the disturbing social unrest’’ in the U.S. “My friends, we cannot tolerate or turn a blind eye to racism and exclusion in any form and yet claim to defend the sacredness of every human life,’’ he said. Trump has pushed the nation’s governors to take a hard line against the violence, tweeting on Tuesday that “lowlifes and losers” were taking over New York’s streets. He again tweeted Wednesday: “LAW & ORDER!” Thousands of people remained out in New York City on Tuesday night, undeterred by an 8 p.m. curfew, though most streets were clear by early Wednesday. Battered storefronts from the earlier rounds of violence could be seen in midtown Manhattan. The New York Police Department credited the curfew, which was three hours earlier than the day before, with helping officers take control of the streets. “The earlier curfew really helped our cops take out of the neighborhoods people that didn’t belong there,” Chief of Department Terence Monahan said on NBC’s “Today.” Protesters also marched in Los Angeles; Miami; St. Paul, Minnesota; Columbia, South Carolina; and Houston, where the police chief talked to peaceful demonstrators, vowing reforms. “God as my witness, change is coming,” Art Acevedo said. “And we’re going to do it the right way.” More than 20,000 National Guard members have been called up in 29 states to deal with the violence. In Philadelphia, a statue of former Mayor Frank Rizzo was removed by the city early Wednesday after repeatedly being targeted by vandals. Rizzo presided over a police force widely accused of racism and brutality in the 1970s. Floyd died after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee against the handcuffed black man’s neck as he cried that he couldn’t breathe. The officer, Derek Chauvin, has been fired and charged with murder.

Agradeció y elogió a Raimondo. «Honro sus palabras y significa mucho para mí y mi cultura de la gente», dijo el hermano Dantzler, que luego la describió como una «luchadora de primera» por la iniciativa. Señaló que la gente tiene que empezar a hablar más sobre los esfuerzos para acabar con el racismo. «Tenemos que enfrentar la realidad de lo que está pasando en el mundo», dijo. El hermano Dantzler también dijo que Black Lives Matter RI no ve a las autoridades como el enemigo. Dijo que sólo porque algunos policías hayan cometido errores, no significa que BLM apoye la violencia contra las autoridades. «No odiamos a los oficiales de policía», dijo. «Estamos tratando de arreglar el problema». La discusión comenzó justo después de las 10:30 a.m. en la Casa Estatal de Rhode Island en Providence, que fue dañada durante un motín a principios de la semana. Varias ventanas permanecieron tapiadas con tablas. «Es un recordatorio de que la violencia no es la respuesta», dijo la gobernadora, añadiendo que hay una gran diferencia entre la protesta pacífica organizada el fin de semana pasado y un motín innecesario. «Esos eran agitadores que buscaban la violencia y desgarrar nuestra comunidad», dijo. En honor a Floyd, se planea una protesta en Providence el viernes a las 4:30 p.m. Incluye una parada que se espera en el Edificio de Seguridad Pública, y posiblemente en la casa del estado. Los jóvenes organizadores llaman al próximo evento una oportunidad para que la comunidad se reúna y pida un cambio. Dijeron que el énfasis estará en hacer que sea un día pacífico. «Somos el futuro. Así que, si empezamos ahora, la fundación, cuando nos hagamos mayores, imagina lo mucho más grandes que seremos», dijo Faith Quinnea de Young Organizers Protest. Sin embargo, los negocios locales no se arriesgan y ya han cerrado sus tiendas. Muchas personas todavía están tratando de procesar los disturbios que estallaron el lunes por la noche, con participantes que irrumpieron en el centro comercial de Providence Place, saquearon varias tiendas, así como dañaron los negocios cercanos. La policía quiere recordarles a todos que habrá un toque de queda a las 9 p.m., y aunque no hay amenazas creíbles ni planes de violencia, el coronel Hugh Clements dijo que están preparados para todo. Raimondo ha alentado a los manifestantes a tomar las precauciones de seguridad de COVID-19 durante los mítines, diciéndoles que se cubran bien la cara, que practiquen el distanciamiento social y que se queden en casa si están enfermos. También les recordó a los manifestantes que permanecieran en sus casas, y que las autoridades estarían disponibles en caso de disturbios. «Si van a la protesta, sean pacíficos», dijo Raimondo.",0.0
