His wife, Eleana Tee Cobb, announced on Facebook that her husband died at his New York City home from lung cancer. He was 91. Born in Washington, D.C., Cobb told The Associated Press in 2019 he listened to jazz albums and stayed up late to hear disc jockey Symphony Sid playing jazz in New York City before launching his professional career. He said it was saxaphonist Cannonball Adderley who recommended him to Davis, and he ended up playing on several Davis recordings. But Cobb’s role as a drummer on the “Kind of Blue” jam session headed by Davis would forever change his career. That album also featured Adderley and John Coltrane. The album, released on Aug. 17, 1959, captured a moment when jazz was transforming from bebop to something newer, cooler and less structured. The full takes of the songs were recorded only once, with one exception, Cobb said. “Freddie Freeloader” needed to be played twice because Davis didn’t like a chord change on the first attempt, he said. Davis, who died in 1991, had some notes jotted down, but there weren’t pages of sheet music. It was up to the improvisers to fill the pages. “He’d say this is a ballad. I want it to sound like it’s floating. And I’d say, ‘OK,’ and that’s what it was,” Cobb recalled. The album received plenty of acclaim at the time, yet the critics, the band and the studio couldn’t have known it would enjoy such longevity. He and his bandmates knew the album would be a hit but didn’t realize at the time how iconic it would become. “We knew it was pretty damned good,” Cobb joked. It has sold more than 4 million copies and remains the best selling jazz album of all time. It also served as a protest album for African American men who looked to Davis and the jazz musicians to break stereotypes about jazz and black humanity. Cobb would also work with such artists as Dinah Washington, Pearl Bailey, Clark Terry, Dizzy Gillespie, Sarah Vaughan, Billie Holiday, Wynton Kelly and Stan Getz. He'd also release a number of albums on his own. He performed well into his late 80s and played in Albuquerque, New Mexico, in 2017, as part of the New Mexico Jazz Festival. Jazz fans from throughout the American Southwest came to pay their respects in what many felt was a goodbye. Cobb released his last album, This I Dig of You, with Smoke Sessions Records in August 2019. ___ This story corrects a previous version that misspelled the name of Miles Davis. ___ Associated Press writer David Sharp contributed to this piece from Portland, Maine. ___ Contreras reported from Albuquerque, New Mexico.

1617044937,2020-05-26 10:36:34,Black man dies after video shows Minneapolis officer kneeling on neck,https://www.valleynewslive.com/content/news/Black-man-dies-after-video-shows-Minneapolis-officer-kneeling-on-neck-570766671.html,en,True,,86247,valleynewslive.com,http://www.valleynewslive.com/#spider,"Four Minneapolis officers involved in the arrest of a black man who died in police custody were fired Tuesday, hours after a bystander’s video showed an officer kneeling on the handcuffed man’s neck, even after he pleaded that he could not breathe and stopped moving. People gather around a makeshift memorial Tuesday, May 26, 2020, in Minneapolis, near where an black man was taken into police custody the day before who later died. The FBI and Minnesota agents are investigating the death of a black man in Minneapolis police custody after video from a bystander showed a white officer kneeling on his neck during his arrest as he pleaded that he couldn't breathe. (AP Photo/Jeff Baenen) WARNING: The Facebook video may be disturbing to viewers. Mayor Jacob Frey announced the firings on Twitter, saying ""This is the right call."" The man’s death Monday night was under investigation by the FBI and state law enforcement authorities. It immediately drew comparisons to the case of Eric Garner, an unarmed black man who died in 2014 in New York after he was placed in a chokehold by police and pleaded for his life, saying he could not breathe. In a post on his Facebook page, Frey apologized Tuesday to the black community for the officer's treatment of the man, who was later identified as 46-year-old George Floyd, who worked security at a restaurant. ""Being Black in America should not be a death sentence. For five minutes, we watched a white officer press his knee into a Black man's neck. Five minutes. When you hear someone calling for help, you're supposed to help. This officer failed in the most basic, human sense,"" Frey posted. Police said the man matched the description of a suspect in a forgery case at a grocery store, and that he resisted arrest. The video starts with the shirtless man on the ground, and does not show what happened in the moments prior. The unidentified officer is kneeling on his neck, ignoring his pleas. ""Please, please, please, I can't breathe. Please, man,"" said Floyd, who has his face against the pavement. Floyd also moans. One of the officers tells him to ""relax."" The man calls for his mother and says: ""My stomach hurts, my neck hurts, everything hurts ... I can't breathe."" As bystanders shout their concern, one officer says, ""He's talking, so he's breathing."" But Floyd stops talking and slowly becomes motionless under the officer's restraint. The officer does not remove his knee until the man is loaded onto a gurney by paramedics. Several witnesses had gathered on a nearby sidewalk, some recording the scene on their phones. The bystanders become increasingly agitated. One man yells repeatedly. ""He's not responsive right now!"" Two witnesses, including one woman who said she was a Minneapolis firefighter, yell at the officers to check the man's pulse. ""Check his pulse right now and tell me what it is!"" she said. At one point, an officer says: ""Don't do drugs, guys."" And one man yells, ""Don't do drugs, bro? What is that? What do you think this is?"" The Hennepin County medical examiner identified Floyd but said the cause of death was pending. Floyd had worked security for five years at a restaurant called Conga Latin Bistro and rented a home from the restaurant owner, Jovanni Thunstrom. He was ""a good friend, person and a good tenant,"" the restaurateur told the Star Tribune. ""He was family. His co-workers and friends loved him."" Ben Crump, a prominent civil rights and personal injury attorney, said he had been hired by Floyd's family. ""We all watched the horrific death of George Floyd on video as witnesses begged the police officer to take him into the police car and get off his neck,"" Crump said in a statement. ""This abusive, excessive and inhumane use of force cost the life of a man who was being detained by the police for questioning about a non-violent charge."" Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo said the department would conduct a full internal investigation. Police did not identify the officers, but attorney Tom Kelly confirmed he is representing Derek Chauvin, the officer seen with his knee on Floyd's neck. Kelly declined to comment further. Police did not immediately respond to a request for Chauvin's service record. News accounts show he was one of six officers who fired their weapons in the 2006 death of Wayne Reyes, whom police said pointed a sawed-off shotgun at officers after stabbing two people. Chauvin also shot and wounded a man in 2008 in a struggle after Chauvin and his partner responded to a reported domestic assault. Several hundred protesters gathered Tuesday evening in the street where Floyd died, chanting and carrying banners that read, ""I can't breathe"" and ""Jail killer KKKops."" They eventually marched about 2 1/2 miles to a city police precinct, with some protesters damaging windows, a squad car and spraying graffiti on the building. A line of police in riot gear eventually confronted the protesters, firing tear gas. Experts on police use of force told The Associated Press that the officer clearly restrained the man too long. They noted the man was under control and no longer fighting. Andrew Scott, a former Boca Raton, Florida, police chief who now testifies as an expert witness in use-of-force cases, called Floyd's death ""a combination of not being trained properly or disregarding their training."" ""He couldn't move. He was telling them he couldn't breathe, and they ignored him,"" Scott said. ""I can't even describe it. It was difficult to watch."" The New York City officer in the Garner case said he was using a legal maneuver called ""the seatbelt"" to bring down Garner, whom police said had been resisting arrest. But the medical examiner referred to it as a chokehold in the autopsy report and said it contributed to his death. Chokehold maneuvers are banned under New York police policy. A grand jury later decided against indicting the officers involved in Garner's death, sparking protests around the country. The New York Police Department ultimately fired the officer who restrained Garner, but it was five years later, after a federal investigation, a city prosecutor's investigation and an internal misconduct trial. In Minneapolis, kneeling on a suspect's neck is allowed under the department's use-of-force policy for officers who have received training in how to compress a neck without applying direct pressure to the airway. It is considered a ""non-deadly force option,"" according to the department's policy handbook. A chokehold is considered a deadly force option and involves someone obstructing the airway. According to the department's use-of-force policy, officers are to use only an amount of force necessary that would be objectively reasonable. Before the officers were fired, the police union asked the public to wait for the investigation to take its course and not to ""rush to judgment and immediately condemn our officers."" Messages left with the union after the firings were not returned. The Hennepin County Attorney's Office, which would handle any prosecution of police on state criminal charges, said in a statement that it was ""shocked and saddened"" by the video and pledged to handle the case fairly. The FBI is investigating whether the officers willfully deprived Floyd of his rights. If those federal civil rights charges are brought, they would be handled by the U.S. Attorney's Office in Minnesota, which declined comment. The death came amid outrage over the death of Ahmaud Arbery, who was fatally shot Feb. 23 in Georgia after a white father and son pursued the 25-year-old black man they had spotted running in their subdivision. More than two months passed before charges were brought. Crump also represents Arbery's father. ___ Associated Press writers Gretchen Ehlke in Milwaukee and Todd Richmond in Madison, Wisconsin, contributed to this report. Copyright 2020 Associated Press.

PAUL — Thousands of people, many donning masks in the age of the coronavirus pandemic, gathered in Minneapolis's Powderhorn neighborhood on the evening of Tuesday, May 26 to decry police brutality and racism after a black man's encounter with city police turned deadly. A peaceful protest of the death of George Floyd turned violent late Tuesday as groups of dozens of protesters clashed with police officers outside of the city's Third Police Precinct building after demonstrators broke glass windows outside the precinct and in parked police vehicles nearby.  Police officers tried to disperse protesters by launching several rounds of chemical irritants and rubber bullets. Demonstrators and journalists in the area reported they’d been hit. Four Minneapolis police officers were fired after the deadly encounter Monday night, during which one officer reportedly pressed his knee against a man's neck for several minutes as he said, ""I can't breathe.""

Minneapolis police responded to a report of a forgery in progress about 8 p.m. Monday, May 25, according to a news release from the department. Officers were alerted that the suspect appeared to be under the influence and found Floyd in a blue vehicle that seemed to match the description called in. Police reported that Floyd appeared to be suffering ""medical distress"" after he was asked to exit his vehicle, physically resisted officers and was handcuffed. The video shows Floyd handcuffed and pinned to the ground facedown while an officer presses his knee into the back of the man's neck for several minutes. ""Please, please, please, I can't breathe,"" Floyd told the officer in the video recording. The video doesn't show the man's arrest. The incident mirrored the 2014 death of Eric Garner, a black man placed in a chokehold by police in New York City. Viewer caution: Graphic video of the arrest. Minneapolis Police Department Public Information Officer John Elder in a news release said two officers then called for an ambulance and the man was transported to Hennepin County Medical Center, where he died. According to a Tuesday afternoon news release from the Hennepin County Medical Examiner, Floyd's cause of death is still yet to be determined. Arradondo said the department would cooperate fully with state and federal officials in their investigations. He said he requested the investigations after viewing the video and speaking with community members. ""We clearly have policies in place regarding placing someone under control,"" Arradondo said. Frey later Tuesday told reporters and local leaders that the hold the officer used on Floyd was not authorized or taught by the department. And he said he would seek justice for Floyd as well as accountability for the officers involved. “The technique that was used is not permitted, is not a technique our officers get trained in on,” Frey said in the conversation broadcast by North News. “There is no reason to apply that pressure to someone’s neck.” The Police Officers Federation of Minneapolis in a Tuesday statement said it will ""provide full support to the involved officers"" as investigators review all video footage and the medical examiner's report. They added that the involved officers' actions and protocol will be reviewed after they provide statements. ""Now is not the time to rush to judgment and immediately condemn our officers,"" the union said. ""We ask that the community remain calm and let the investigation be completed in full."" Officers were wearing body cameras that were activated during the stop. The BCA in a statement said it would present its findings without recommendation to the Hennepin County Attorney's office. In a Tuesday statement, the Hennepin County Attorney's Office said its team was ""shocked and saddened"" by the video. Several of the county's attorneys are assisting to direct the investigation and are consulting with the U.S. Attorney.

For police to call his death a ‘medical incident’ is an insult.” State and local leaders on Tuesday also voiced their disdain about the incident in recorded news conferences and on social media.

'I can't breathe': Protest turns violent after man apparently killed by Minneapolis police officers Thousands of people, many donning masks in the age of the coronavirus pandemic, gathered in Minneapolis' Powderhorn neighborhood on the evening of Tuesday, May 26, to decry police brutality and racism after a black man's encounter with city police turned deadly. A peaceful protest of the death of George Floyd turned violent late Tuesday as groups of dozens of protesters clashed with police officers outside of the city's Third Police Precinct building after demonstrators broke glass windows outside the precinct and in parked police vehicles nearby. Police officers tried to disperse protesters by launching several rounds of chemical irritants and rubber bullets. Demonstrators and journalists in the area reported they’d been hit.

Becker County community rallies behind family devastated by house fire A Becker County dad who tried to save his young son from a deadly weekend house fire has been released from the hospital, but two other people — including his wife and a little girl — remain in a Twin Cities burn unit.  According to Becker County Sheriff Todd Glander, the fire appears to be accidental. He said they received three 911 calls from inside the burning home early Sunday morning, and despite the heroic efforts of several family members, they were unable to save a little boy. The fast-moving fire ripped through the family's home about 10 miles north of Detroit Lakes just after midnight Sunday. Smoke alarms sent the nearly dozen kids scrambling to save their parents upstairs, but they were blocked by fire. Watch the story from WDAY's Matt Henson 3. Second Ruby's Pantry area pandemic food distribution brings hundreds A long line of cars twisted across Bethel Church’s parking lot Tuesday afternoon, May 26, as Ruby’s Pantry distributed food in the area for the second time during the pandemic. Usually, The Rev. Michelle Webber plans for 300 bundles, but this time she prepared for more. “They sent us 400 today,” said Webber, the pastor at First Congregational United Church of Christ in Moorhead. “They’ve been maxing out all across the state.” With half the volunteers that Webber usually has, and 30% more people needing supplies, social distancing was difficult, she said. Volunteers wore masks while they filled boxes with onions and cheeses under a hot sun. Webber wore a homemade clerical mask. Read more from The Forum's C.S. Hagen 4. North Dakota confirms 43 new COVID-19 cases on low-testing holiday The North Dakota Department of Health on Tuesday, May 26, announced 43 new cases of COVID-19. Fewer than 1,000 test results were reported Tuesday, marking a significant drop from recent weeks when the department has regularly announced more than 2,000 tests per day. Department spokeswoman Nicole Peske attributed the low testing figures to the Memorial Day holiday. A total of 2,422 North Dakota residents have tested positive, but 70% have recovered from the illness. There are 40 residents hospitalized with the illness, down one from Monday. Fifty-four North Dakotans, including 43 residents of Cass County, have now died from the illness that has claimed more than 99,000 lives nationwide. At least 40 of the deaths in the state have come in nursing homes and other long-term care facilities, which are viewed as particularly susceptible to deadly outbreaks of COVID-19 because many residents are 65 or older and have underlying conditions.

A 104-year-old Moorhead woman survived flu pandemic in 1918 only to die of COVID-19 in 2020 Violet Nelson survived the flu pandemic of 1918 in her youth in Minnesota but succumbed to the second virus to cause a pandemic in more than a century. She became North Dakota's oldest COVID-19 victim this May. Nelson was a resident of Moorhead before she moved into Villa Maria nursing home in Fargo. At 104 years old, Nelson died after contracting the coronavirus while living in the nursing home. Last month, COVID-19 cases spiked in North Dakota nursing homes where 21 of the 25 cases were reported at Villa Maria on April 27.

Demonstrators returned to the spot in Minneapolis' Powderhorn neighborhood Wednesday, prompting calls from local police and state officials to maintain safe practices during the demonstration. In a Wednesday statement, the Minnesota Board of Peace Officer Standards and Training called the video ""troubling and disturbing,"" and said the officer's tactic ""do not appear to reflect the training that students receive"" in police training. Following the police encounter, Floyd was transported to Hennepin County Medical Center and pronounced dead. The Minneapolis Fire Department on Wednesday made public an incident report from the Monday evening encounter. According to the report, responders spoke to an off-duty firefighter who witnessed the incident, during which Floyd went “from struggling to unresponsive on the ground while handcuffed and subdued by PD.” MFD reported that while in the ambulance, Floyd was unresponsive and had no pulse. Medics reportedly put Floyd on a ventilator and IV, and “delivered one shock by their monitor.” His pulse never returned. The four officers who were present at the scene — Derek Chauvin, Thomas Lane, Tou Thao and J Alexander Kueng — have all been fired from the police department. The incident has garnered national attention from activists and politicians alike. On Wednesday, President Donald Trump in a tweet called Floyd's death ""very sad and tragic,"" and said the FBI and Department of Justice ""are already well into an investigation,"" which he has asked to be expedited. Also on Wednesday, U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar tweeted, ""The police officer who killed George Floyd should be charged with murder."" Gov.

""I'm urging those who are gathering to please do so peacefully,"" he said. ""Criminal behavior will not be tolerated."" Frey said at Wednesday's news conference that he commends ""the 99% of protesters that were there last night doing so in a peaceful manner,"" and that they can get ""lumped in"" with those who become violent. But ""those rights (to protest), they must stop when others' public safety are put at risk."" State public safety and health officials also urged protesters to social distance and wear masks to limit the potential transmission of COVID-19 (most protesters Tuesday night were wearing masks, and free masks were handed out by organizers).

Members of the state Legislature's People of Color and Indigenous Caucus on Tuesday called for a full and transparent investigation of Floyd's death and for murder charges to be brought against the officers involved.

Demonstrators shut down the Hollywood Freeway in Los Angeles on Wednesday, May 27, 2020, during a protest about the death of George Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis earlier in the week. (Source: AP Photo/Ringo H.W. Chiu) Based on the video, Mayor Jacob Frey said officer Derek Chauvin should be charged in the death of George Floyd. The footage recorded by a bystander shows Chauvin with his knee on Floyd's neck as Floyd gasps for breath on the ground with his face against the pavement. The officer does not move for at least eight minutes, even after Floyd stops speaking and moving. “I've wrestled with, more than anything else over the last 36 hours, one fundamental question: Why is the man who killed George Floyd not in jail?” said Frey, who is white. He later added: ""I saw no threat. I saw nothing that would signal that this kind of force was necessary.” The day after Floyd died, Chauvin and three other officers were fired — an act that did not stem the flood of anger that followed the widely seen video shot on Memorial Day outside a convenience store. Protesters marched more than 2 miles Tuesday to the police precinct in that part of the city, with some damaging property and skirmishing with officers in riot gear who fired tear gas. Conflict erupted again Wednesday at the same precinct, with some protesters throwing rocks and bottles at police. News helicopter video appeared to show looting of nearby stores, including a Target, a Cub Foods and an auto parts store, with no evident police intervention. Another demonstration unfolded on the street outside Chauvin's suburban home. An officer told protesters that Chauvin was not there. Red cans of paint were earlier spilled on his driveway, and someone wrote “murderer” in chalk at the end of his driveway. No one answered when an Associated Press reporter knocked on the door. Many activists, citizens and celebrities called for criminal charges before Frey did. But Floyd's family and the community may have to wait months, if not years, before investigations are complete. Floyd family attorney Benjamin Crump, a prominent civil rights lawyer, called for peaceful protests. “We cannot sink to the level of our oppressors, and we must not endanger others during this pandemic,” Crump said in a statement. “We will demand and ultimately force lasting change by shining a light on treatment that is horrific and unacceptable and by winning justice.” Police Chief Medaria Arradondo, who rose to the top job after his predecessor was forced out following the 2017 shooting of an unarmed white woman by a black Minneapolis officer, urged protesters to “be respectful.” He said he was working to change the department's culture. “One incident can significantly bring people to doubt that,” he said. The chief defended the department’s use of tear gas to break up Tuesday night’s protests, saying officers used it only after some people broke into a secure area that gave them access to squad cars and weapons. Gov. Tim Walz and Minnesota’s two top law enforcement officials — Attorney General Keith Ellison and Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington, both black — promised a thorough, transparent investigation. But Walz and Ellison didn't endorse the mayor’s call to immediately charge the officer, saying the legal process needs to play out. “I understand the emotions are running high, and I think it’s important for the mayor to channel the emotion of the people who he represents. But I think it is critical that we adhere very closely to the facts and the law and the normal process,” Ellison said. The Hennepin County Attorney’s Office, which would prosecute any state charges, issued a statement saying that Floyd's death had “outraged us and people across the country” and that the case “deserves the best we can give.” The FBI was investigating whether officers willfully deprived Floyd of his civil rights. Floyd’s death and that of Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia have reopened the divide between minority communities and police that grew to a national uproar following the 2014 killings of Eric Garner and Michael Brown, the 2015 killing of Freddie Gray and others. Speaking to reporters at Cape Canaveral, Florida, President Donald Trump called the death in Minneapolis “a very, very sad event"" and said his administration was going to “look at it.” Later, he tweeted that he had asked for the federal investigation be expedited. Democrat Joe Biden said Floyd's death was “part of an ingrained, systemic cycle of injustice that still exists in this country” and ""cuts at the very heart of our sacred belief that all Americans are equal in rights.” It also “sends a very clear message to the black community and black lives that are under threat every single day,"" Biden added, saying he was glad the mayor and the police department fired the officers, ""but I don’t think that’s enough.” A 2017 Pew Research Center study found that police think the public does not understand the risks they face. A more recent study from September showed police were considered more trustworthy than Congress, but only 33% of black adults and half of Hispanics say they believe officers treat racial and ethnic groups equally. Shocking videos of black men dying continue to emerge during the pandemic, which is hitting communities of color harder than white communities. Floyd himself had been laid off from his nightclub security job in the pandemic, a friend told the AP. Police say Floyd matched the description of someone who tried to pay with a counterfeit bill at the convenience store. It was unclear why Floyd was arrested in such a physical way for what would have been a low-level crime. Police in most large cities have backed away from certain arrests to guard against further spread of the virus. The officers in the video were not wearing masks. A Minneapolis Fire Department report shows that paramedics moved Floyd from the scene, and two fire crew members got into the ambulance to help. Medics were doing chest compressions and other lifesaving measures on an “unresponsive, pulseless male,” the report said. Floyd was pronounced dead at a hospital. An autopsy will be performed to determine if the neck compression led to his death. News accounts show Chauvin was one of six officers who fired their weapons in the 2006 death of Wayne Reyes, who police said pointed a sawed-off shotgun at officers after stabbing two people. Chauvin also shot and wounded a man in 2008 during a struggle after Chauvin and his partner responded to a reported domestic assault. Police did not immediately respond to a request for Chauvin’s service record. Chauvin's attorney confirmed the officer's identity on Tuesday. The department identified the other officers Wednesday as Thomas Lane, Tou Thao and J Alexander Kueng. In calling for charges, the mayor contrasted Floyd's death with others involving police that turned on split-second decisions by officers. “We are not talking about a split-second decision that was made incorrectly,"" Frey said. ""There’s somewhere around 300 seconds in those five minutes — every one of which that officer could have turned back, every second of which he could have removed his knee from George Floyd's neck.” ___ Long reported from Washington.

He said police forces were prepared for a group of mostly peaceful demonstrators near the 3rd precinct, as they saw the night before, but the crowd grew larger and more mobile than they'd prepared for. “There was a different tenor last night, there was a different group of individuals,” Arradondo said. Early Thursday, a spokesman for the Minneapolis Police Department said a man was killed in a shooting late Wednesday blocks away from the demonstrations and another individual was in custody. Officers didn't immediately issue the identities of the man who died or the person in custody. The Minneapolis Fire Department on Thursday said crews responded to 30 events and at least 16 structure fires overnight and continued to extinguish fires along Lake Street. In a news release, they said the fires were set intentionally and department equipment had been damaged as demonstrators threw rocks and other projectiles. Minneapolis police officers guarded firefighters who attempted to put out the fires but were hit with objects thrown by protesters or couldn't access some of the blazes due to large groups of demonstrators. Police officers sustained minor injuries and the fire department didn't report injuries to firefighters or residents as a result of the fires. Officers used chemical irritants and rubber bullets on demonstrators and looters in attempts to end the looting and break up the protests. State Sen. Jeff Hayden, D-Minneapolis, on Thursday told reporters that the looting and fires were an expression of grief and frustration about Floyd's death and of the deaths of other people of color at the hands of law enforcement officers. ""We are grieving for our community, which is literally on fire because of the pain because of the senseless murder,” Hayden said, noting his concern about attention to the damage overshadowing Floyd's death. ""I would hope that we would stay focused on the killing of George Floyd and the killing of other black and brown and Indigenous people in this community.” As the protest across town stretched from Wednesday to Thursday, a series of break-ins shook the Uptown neighborhood in Minneapolis. At least 20 businesses were broken in to and looted early Thursday morning, from the local Target and Cub Foods grocery store to boutique clothiers and the neighborhood's Apple store. Thurston Jewelers, a fixture near the intersection of Lake Street and Lyndale Avenue for more than 100 years, was burgled ""for everything,"" store owner Lloyd Drilling said. According to eyewitness reports, assailants shot the windows of the store before entering. Because of widespread vandalism and looting, response times for law enforcement were slow. ""It's sickening,"" Drilling said. ""They really got everything. It took 45, 50 minutes for the police to show up."" Drilling was quick to point out the break-in likely was unrelated to the protests, but rather it was done ""by people trying to take advantage of the situation.""",0.0

Fire could be seen in the building around 10:30 p.m. Thursday and the department in a statement said the building had been compromised and all officers within evacuated safely. The crowd surrounded the building and cheered as the flames burned. Firefighters waited to approach the building as rioters shot fireworks into the building. Late Thursday, tensions grew between demonstrators and police after protesters threw objects at officers and officers responded by using pepper spray and stun grenades to break up their groups. Throughout most of the day, the gatherings in Minneapolis occurred peacefully. In St. Paul, meanwhile, separate groups of looters broke into several businesses and set fire to stores. 1 / 26 2 / 26 3 / 26 4 / 26 5 / 26 6 / 26 7 / 26 8 / 26 9 / 26 10 / 26 11 / 26 12 / 26 13 / 26 14 / 26 15 / 26 16 / 26 17 / 26 18 / 26 19 / 26 20 / 26 21 / 26 22 / 26 23 / 26 24 / 26 25 / 26 26 / 26 listen live watch live President Donald Trump weighed in on the situation, saying local leaders should step up to address the riots.

""Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts. Thank you!"" The Minnesota National Guard Thursday night said it had 500 soldiers at the ready to respond to the protests. Walz on Thursday activated the guard at the request of Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey. ""We have activated more than 500 soldiers to St. Paul, Minneapolis and surrounding communities,"" the Minnesota National Guard said on Twitter. ""Our mission is to protect life, preserve property and the right to peacefully demonstrate. A key objective is to ensure fire departments are able to respond to calls."" We have activated more than 500 soldiers to St. Paul, Minneapolis and surrounding communities. Our mission is to protect life, preserve property and the right to peacefully demonstrate. A key objective is to ensure fire departments are able to respond to calls. — MN National Guard (@MNNationalGuard) May 29, 2020 For a third day, demonstrators convened near the site where George Floyd was held down by a Minneapolis police officer who knelt on his neck as he said he couldn't breathe. Thousands marched through the streets and called for the prosecution of four police officers on the scene during the incident. Four officers at the scene during the incident — Derek Chauvin, Thomas Lane, Tou Thao and J Alexander Kueng — have been fired from the Minneapolis Police Department. State and federal investigators and prosecutors said work on parallel investigations into the death were ongoing and they asked for additional information from witnesses to help fill out the framework of what happened. And they urged those calling for quick answers to remain calm and give them time. Prior deadly force charges had been brought too quickly and failed in court, they said. ""We are going to investigate it as expeditiously, as thoroughly and completely as justice demands. Sometimes that takes a little time. And we ask people to be patient,"" Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman said. A transcript of the 911 call reporting #GeorgeFloyd has been released. This was before the cops showed up and Floyd died. https://t.co/VEq5qWEe24 — Sarah Mearhoff (@sarah_mearhoff) May 29, 2020 Community leaders including local elected officials and faith leaders, meanwhile, have spoken out to criticize the actions of Minneapolis police officers that preceded Floyd's death. In a statement posted online, the National Fraternal Order of Police — the largest cop union in the U.S. — condemned tactics used on Floyd. Floyd was transported to the hospital after he was arrested and pinned down on Monday. He later died and a video depicting his last minutes sparked widespread backlash and a call to investigate what happened after police initially called it a medical disorder. Guard deploys A day after dozens of stores were looted near demonstrations against Minneapolis police and several fires were set in the Powderhorn neighborhood, Gov. Tim Walz on Thursday activated the Minnesota National Guard to assist Minneapolis police and other law enforcement in containing demonstrations. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey had called on the state to deploy the Minnesota National Guard to the city as demonstrators. The move to bring in the National Guard went against the guidance of protesters and community leaders who called for de-escalation and removal of police. State and local officials along with prominent faith leaders urged demonstrators to protest peacefully Thursday night. ""George Floyd’s death should lead to justice and systemic change, not more death and destruction. As George Floyd’s family has said, ‘Floyd would not want people to get hurt. He lived his life protecting people,’"" Walz said in a news release. ""Let’s come together to rebuild, remember, and seek justice for George Floyd."" The Minneapolis NAACP on Thursday tweeted that the National Guard presence was not needed and asked for law enforcement to deescalate the scene. The National Guard is not needed! Minneapolis needs resources to support mental health, community building, and businesses. Charge the Officers! And work to deescalate the situation! — Minneapolis NAACP (@NAACPmpls) May 28, 2020 Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo said his department would allow peaceful protests to continue but would take action against those looting or setting fires. ""Even prior to Mr. Floyd's death, we have had a community that has been in trauma for quite some time. And what I cannot allow as chief is for others to compound that trauma. So, if individuals, as occurred last night, are committing behaviors and acts which are criminal ... I cannot allow that,"" Arradondo said. ""I am committed to making sure we restore peace and security in our community."" Frey said Minneapolis enabled a unified command structure that allowed it to bring in additional jurisdictions to assist with law enforcement needs, including 200 troopers from the State Patrol. Police from St. Paul and suburban police forces on Wednesday night joined Minneapolis officers in responding to demonstrations. The activation and a peacetime emergency declaration free up state patrol helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft to help monitor demonstrations and access to the State Emergency Operations Center, which had been activated due to the COVID-19 epidemic. A call for peace State and local leaders on Thursday urged demonstrators to gather peacefully to avoid further trauma to a community reeling from Floyd's death and the aftermath of protests against the Minneapolis Police Department. “We feel as if there was a knee on all of our collective necks, a knee that says, 'black life does not matter,'” Minneapolis Council Vice President Andrea Jenkins said Thursday. ""I am a part of this system to help to take that knee off of our necks and that is the work I will be doing ... I know that something has got to change."" Jenkins called on elected officials to declare a state of emergency declaring racism as a public health issue and she urged demonstrators and others to gather and protest without violence. Jenkins and others said community and faith leaders would be out Thursday calling for peace and setting up a healing site at the precinct. ""We need peace and calm in our streets and I am begging you for that,"" Jenkins said. Frey on Thursday said he was hopeful that Minneapolis would rise to the occasion and continue mourning Floyd without violence. ""We must restore the peace so we can do this hard work together,"" Frey said. ""At this time when one crisis is sandwiched against the other, this could be a marker. This could be the point in time when several years from now we can know that we rose to right the wrongs of the past."" Looting in St. Paul Thursday afternoon and into the evening, looting in St. Paul's Midway area forced the shutdown of several buildings. Late Thursday night, the St. Paul Police Department reported that 170 businesses were damaged or looted and several fires were extinguished. No serious injuries were reported. Throngs of protesters gathered outside a Target store there on University Avenue, circling the parking lot until at least 5 p.m. Some threw rocks and bottles at the police officers present, who would then respond by deploying chemical irritants in a bid to disperse the crowd. Multiple glass-windowed storefronts along nearby blocks of University Avenue were visibly shattered by late Thursday afternoon as well, with the St. Paul city police reporting looting and break-ins. Motorists passing through the area shouted at the protesters who walked or ran by or else sped past them to avoid the frenzy. Firefighters responded to fires at multiple storefronts Thursday afternoon. Lines of people formed outside of some locally owned businesses, perhaps in an effort to prevent them from being damaged. And St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter urged demonstrators to stay calm and asked that they stay at home to continue honoring Floyd's life. ""I’m angry/ sad as anyone & pushing for the officers who killed George Floyd to be arrested ASAP,"" he wrote.

Governor Tim Walz, DFL, said local leaders requested the National Guard after “extensive damage to private property occurred and peaceful protests evolved into a dangerous situation for protesters and first responders.” Along with the guard, approximately 200 members of the Minnesota State Patrol will assist in public safety efforts for the next few days. On Monday, an white officer with the Minneapolis Police Department was recorded in a now viral video placing a knee on the neck of George Floyd. Floyd was later pronounced dead by investigators. Four officers were fired, but that incident has sparked riots and looting. According to the Minneapolis Fire Department, there were at least 16 structure fires from Wednesday night into Thursday morning. Below is the full press release by Governor Walz’s office. ====================================================== [ST. PAUL, MN] – Governor Tim Walz today signed Executive Order 20-65, activating the Minnesota National Guard to help protect Minnesotans’ safety and maintain peace in the wake of George Floyd’s death. Local leaders have requested National Guard resources after extensive damage to private property occurred and peaceful protests evolved into a dangerous situation for protesters and first responders. “It is time to rebuild. Rebuild the city, rebuild our justice system, and rebuild the relationship between law enforcement and those they’re charged to protect. George Floyd’s death should lead to justice and systemic change, not more death and destruction. As George Floyd’s family has said, ‘Floyd would not want people to get hurt. He lived his life protecting people.’ Let’s come together to rebuild, remember, and seek justice for George Floyd,” said Governor Walz. “The anger and grief of this moment is unbearable. People deserve to be seen. People deserve to be heard. People deserve to be safe,” said Lieutenant Governor Peggy Flanagan. “While many Minnesotans are taking extensive safety precautions while exercising their right to protest, the demonstration last night became incredibly unsafe for all involved. The purpose of the National Guard is to protect people, to protect people safely demonstrating, and to protect small business owners.” “As Governor, I will always defend the right to protest,” Governor Walz continued. “It is how we express pain, process tragedy, and create change. That is why I am answering our local leaders’ request for Minnesota National Guard assistance to protect peaceful demonstrators, neighbors, and small businesses in Minnesota.” The National Guard Adjutant General will work with local government agencies to provide personnel, equipment, and facilities needed to respond to and recover from this emergency. Additionally, the Minnesota State Patrol will assist in public safety efforts for the next several days. Approximately 200 troopers will work with state, county, and local community and public safety partners. State Patrol helicopters and fixed wind aircraft will also be available to assist law enforcement officers on the ground. This Executive Order also declares a peacetime emergency, which activates the State Emergency Operations Center (SEOC) to help coordinate the state’s response. As the SEOC is already activated due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it will concurrently support the COVID-19 response and the City of Minneapolis and surrounding communities during this situation. On May 27, 2020, George Floyd died while in custody of the Minneapolis Police Department. The Walz-Flanagan Administration is committed to addressing the systemic inequities and discrimination that led to this incident and seeking justice. ",0.0

They chanted for justice in Memphis. They stopped freeway traffic in Los Angeles. The death of George Floyd continued to ripple across the U.S. on Wednesday night as the calls became louder for the arrest of the white police officer who knelt on his neck for several minutes in a horrifying video that spread across social media this week. Meanwhile on Thursday, Ben Crump, attorney for Floyd's family, warned any instigators of violence in the Minneapolis protests: ""We don't need that. We need people focused on getting justice,"" he said. He is calling for an independent autopsy, saying he doesn't trust the city of Minneapolis. ""They offered him no humanity while keeping his knee on his neck. Members of the public were the only ones trying to de-escalate the situation. Not the police,"" Crump told CNN on Thursday. ""Keeping the knee on the neck for over 8 minutes – that is unconscionable."" While hundreds of protesters took to the streets, police chiefs from coast to coast expressed their outrage with Floyd's death. ""Do not defend the undefendable, attempt to justify the unjustifiable or excuse the inexcusable,"" Miami Police Chief Jorge Colina said on Twitter. ""George Floyd should be alive today."" ""The lack of compassion, use of excessive force, or going beyond the scope of the law, doesn't just tarnish our badge – it tears at the very fabric of race relations in this country,"" Los Angeles Police Chief Michel Moore said in a statement posted to Twitter. Minneapolis: Police, protesters clash; looters raid Target, Dollar Tree, other stores Protests in Minneapolis devolved into chaos on Wednesday night. Reports of fires came from around the city and videos of looters inside of stores quickly spread on social media. Several people shared video of people taking products from a local Target. A Cub Foods, a Dollar Tree and an AutoZone store also showed signs of damage and looting, and windows of businesses in nearby strip malls were reported to be smashed out. At least one person was killed. Police spokesman John Elder told USA TODAY that the department was investigating a homicide near the area where a reporter from the Star Tribune newspaper tweeted that a looter had been shot and killed by a pawn shop owner. One person was in custody early Thursday, the Star Tribune reported, but police wouldn't confirm if the victim was a looter. “The facts of what led up to the shooting are still being sorted out. We are truly in the infancy of this investigation,” Elder said. As the protests stretched into the evening, Police Chief Medaria Arradondo urged calm. In an interview with KMSP-TV, he noted the internal investigation as well as the FBI’s investigation of Floyd’s death and said they offer a chance at justice. “Justice historically has never come to fruition through some of the acts we’re seeing tonight, whether it’s the looting, the damage to property or other things,” he said. Memphis: George Floyd's death was 'nail in the unfortunate coffin for America' A silent demonstration to protest the death of Floyd, as well as Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery, turned into verbal confrontations with Memphis police and counter-protesters. The rally began with about 40 people holding signs reading “Black Lives Matter,” “Stop killing black people” and “Silence is violence.” Protesters were largely silent, with occasional chants of “no justice, no peace” and the names of black men and women who had been killed by police officers. Passing drivers — and one ambulance — honked in support and waved or gave thumbs-up. Within an hour, however, the protesters were met by two counter-protesters, who identified themselves as members of the Facebook group Confederate 901. Theryn C. Bond, a prominent local activist and former Memphis City Council candidate, confronted the counter-protesters, who occasionally jeered at the crowd to ""go out for a jog"" — a reference to Aubrey's slaying. ""I was so impressed to see so many white allies,"" Bond said. ""Because sometimes we think, 'Everybody doesn't get it.' And I think with the recent murder of George Floyd by police... I think this was the proverbial nail in the unfortunate coffin for America to really understand what we mean when we say, 'Black Lives Matter.'"" Floyd's death this week is the latest in a string of violence against black people. Taylor was shot and killed in her Kentucky home by officers executing a ""no-knock"" search warrant, while Arbery was shot and killed while jogging after being pursued by two white men who later said they thought he was a burglary suspect.

Los Angeles: Protesters block 101 freeway, smash windows of California Highway Patrol cruisers Hundreds of people protesting Floyd's death while in police custody blocked a Los Angeles freeway and shattered windows of California Highway Patrol cruisers in a rally organized by Black Lives Matter. Demonstrators gathered in the late afternoon on downtown streets and, eventually, dozens of them moved onto U.S. 101 despite police efforts to keep them from walking into the lanes. When a CHP patrol car arrived, demonstrators surrounded it. The car's window was smashed and it jerked forward and moved away with several protesters who had jumped onto the hood. Television news footage showed one man finally hopping or jumping from the side of the moving car and then flopping onto the ground. A second CHP car arrived and was attacked, with one demonstrator hurling what appeared to be a wooden skateboard through the back window before it moved off. At its rally's peak, hundreds of people gathered outside the Los Angeles County Hall of Justice. The demonstration was mostly peaceful and no arrests were immediately made, Los Angeles police Officer Mike Lopez said. Contributing: Corinne S. Kennedy, Micaela A.

This upcoming Saturday is when a peaceful protest is set for those in the area to “pay respect to George’s family and countless other black lives that have been taken by the hands of police,” according to the “Fargo Marches for George Floyd“ event page. The protest is set to begin at Island Park at 10 a.m., and event organizers stress that they will be marching in peace, saying any kind of violence or destruction will not be tolerated. According to the Facebook event page, everyone must be wearing a face mask in order to participate. Fargo Police say they’ve reached out to event organizers to help support and facilitate a peaceful protest. The department, however, won’t comment on the logistics of how they would do so. Jaamal Abegaz of Moorhead is one of more than 900 people (as of Thursday evening) planning on showing up this Saturday. “That’s a message to every legislator, every city commissioner, every county commissioner, every police officer, every actor of the state. But for us do you sit where you sit. And if you think for a second that that is not the case, here, let’s march in the streets and remind you,” he says. The protest is in George Floyd’s name, but Abegaz says it’s also about much more. “People are upset. People are loudly upset. They are challenging the police because it is not just about a single incident. It’s about a hundred years old history of this type of disregard for a specific population.” For Abegaz, Floyd’s death serves as a reminder. “George Floyd’s murder has been another horrifying example. It just reminds me that the system will keep killing us.” That is, he says, until real change can be made. A map of the route for the protest is posted on the event’s Facebook page.",0.0

The crowd surrounded the building and cheered as the flames burned. Firefighters waited to approach the building as rioters shot fireworks into the building. Late Thursday, tensions grew between demonstrators and police after protesters threw objects at officers and officers responded by using pepper spray and stun grenades to break up their groups.

Guard deploys A day after dozens of stores were looted near demonstrations against Minneapolis police and several fires were set in the Powderhorn neighborhood, Gov. Tim Walz on Thursday activated the Minnesota National Guard to assist Minneapolis police and other law enforcement in containing demonstrations. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey had called on the state to deploy the Minnesota National Guard to the city as demonstrators. The move to bring in the National Guard went against the guidance of protesters and community leaders who called for de-escalation and removal of police. State and local officials along with prominent faith leaders urged demonstrators to protest peacefully Thursday night. ""George Floyd’s death should lead to justice and systemic change, not more death and destruction. As George Floyd’s family has said, ‘Floyd would not want people to get hurt.

""I am a part of this system to help to take that knee off of our necks and that is the work I will be doing ... I know that something has got to change.""

Frey on Thursday said he was hopeful that Minneapolis would rise to the occasion and continue mourning Floyd without violence.

Throngs of protesters gathered outside a Target store there on University Avenue, circling the parking lot until at least 5 p.m. Some threw rocks and bottles at the police officers present, who would then respond by deploying chemical irritants in a bid to disperse the crowd. Multiple glass-windowed storefronts along nearby blocks of University Avenue were visibly shattered by late Thursday afternoon as well, with the St. Paul city police reporting looting and break-ins.

On the sidewalk, a pile of signs, flowers, candles and balloons paid homage to Floyd. A clothing line hung from a telephone pole, offering free home-made masks to demonstrators amid the coronavirus pandemic. Artists painted a colorful mural of Floyd, surrounded by a sunflower and blue skies. Bystander video captured the last moments of Floyd's life Monday, as a white officer knelt on his neck for several minutes and Floyd, who was black, repeated ""I can't breathe"" until he fell still. The scene mirrored that of Eric Garner, who cried the same words while in a New York police officer's chokehold in 2014 before he, too died. Garner's mother Gwen Carr made an appearance at 38th and Chicago on Thursday, telling the crowd circled around her that watching Floyd perish ""is just opening up our old wounds, and pouring salt in them."" Six years after her son died, she said ""the police officers keep coming into our neighborhoods."" listen live watch live ""They brutalize. They terrorize. They murder our children,"" she said. But she urged the community to resist violence. Instead, she encouraged onlookers to voice their frustration at the ballot box. Civil rights activist Al Sharpton also made an appearance. He called for the prompt arrest and charging of officer Derek Chauvin, who knelt on Floyd's neck Monday, as well as the three other officers present who did not intervene. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey has also called for Chauvin's arrest, but the Hennepin County Attorney's Office says there is more investigating to be done first. Though the scene in Powderhorn was peaceful, Sharpton said ""we understand the outrage, and that the nearby looting and riots are ""the unheard speaking."" He said the city is reeling after seeing Floyd's death because ""this is not the first time."" ""When I got here, someone said to me, ‘Are you going to address the violence?’"" Sharpton said. ""The violence I’m addressing is how a man could hold a man down with a knee on his neck for nine minutes. That’s when the violence started. The violence started on this corner."" Pastor Curtis Farrar, who preaches at World Outreach for Christ Church, said the black community has a tumultuous relationship with the police, but that Chauvin's actions aren't representative of law enforcement as a whole. For example, he pointed to bicycles purchased for neighborhood youth by the city police last year. But Farrar said that doesn't mean Chauvin is exonerated for what happened Monday. What the community would consider justice, Farrar said, would be for the legal system to not grant Chauvin any special privilege for his status as a police officer. ""They're supposed to be our example of what a good citizen really is,"" he said. ""They are supposed to protect and serve.""",0.0

On the sidewalk, a pile of signs, flowers, candles and balloons paid homage to Floyd. A clothing line hung from a telephone pole, offering free home-made masks to demonstrators amid the coronavirus pandemic. Artists painted a colorful mural of Floyd, surrounded by a sunflower and blue skies. Bystander video captured the last moments of Floyd's life Monday, as a white officer knelt on his neck for several minutes and Floyd, who was black, repeated ""I can't breathe"" until he fell still. The scene mirrored that of Eric Garner, who cried the same words while in a New York police officer's chokehold in 2014 before he, too died. Garner's mother Gwen Carr made an appearance at 38th and Chicago on Thursday, telling the crowd circled around her that watching Floyd perish ""is just opening up our old wounds, and pouring salt in them."" Six years after her son died, she said ""the police officers keep coming into our neighborhoods."" listen live watch live ""They brutalize. They terrorize. They murder our children,"" she said. But she urged the community to resist violence. Instead, she encouraged onlookers to voice their frustration at the ballot box. Civil rights activist Al Sharpton also made an appearance. He called for the prompt arrest and charging of officer Derek Chauvin, who knelt on Floyd's neck Monday, as well as the three other officers present who did not intervene. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey has also called for Chauvin's arrest, but the Hennepin County Attorney's Office says there is more investigating to be done first. Though the scene in Powderhorn was peaceful, Sharpton said ""we understand the outrage, and that the nearby looting and riots are ""the unheard speaking."" He said the city is reeling after seeing Floyd's death because ""this is not the first time."" ""When I got here, someone said to me, ‘Are you going to address the violence?’"" Sharpton said. ""The violence I’m addressing is how a man could hold a man down with a knee on his neck for nine minutes. That’s when the violence started. The violence started on this corner."" Pastor Curtis Farrar, who preaches at World Outreach for Christ Church, said the black community has a tumultuous relationship with the police, but that Chauvin's actions aren't representative of law enforcement as a whole. For example, he pointed to bicycles purchased for neighborhood youth by the city police last year. But Farrar said that doesn't mean Chauvin is exonerated for what happened Monday. What the community would consider justice, Farrar said, would be for the legal system to not grant Chauvin any special privilege for his status as a police officer. ""They're supposed to be our example of what a good citizen really is,"" he said. ""They are supposed to protect and serve.""",0.0

While most of the protests have been peaceful, both honoring the late Floyd and the social justice movement, some factions have left vandalism, fires and looting in their wake. People rioting have breached the Minneapolis Police Department's Third Precinct and set the building on fire as of reports coming in around 10:30 p.m. Thursday night. Minneapolis Police Spokesperson John Elder said in a statement that they had evacuated staff from the building due to safety concerns shortly after 10 p.m. According to Elder, ""Protesters forcibly entered the building and have ignited several fires."" The City of Minneapolis put out a tweet Thursday warning citizens to stay away from MPD's Third Precinct building, citing unconfirmed reports of cut gas lines and explosive materials in the building. Earlier in the day, people gathered at the intersection of 38th and Chicago in downtown Minneapolis at the scene of Floyd's death. In one location, Minneapolis artists worked to paint a mural of Floyd. ""Hopefully, it’s a reminder that this should never happen again, and people need to step up in every way that they can to stand up against these corrupt systems,"" said Xena Goldman, one of the artists. In Minneapolis, a powerful moment occurred. An entire crowd just went silent, took a knee and raised a fist in remembrance of George Floyd. Elsewhere, shopkeepers and business owners were forced to clean up in the wake of vandalism and fires that were reported throughout the Twin Cities. In one of the many examples, Gus from Augie’s in downtown Minneapoils off Hennepin Avenue told KARE 11 protesters shattered a door to the BuzzMart despite their pleas. Luckily he says they, and some of the crowd, deterred anyone from entering. Business owners along Lake Street in south Minneapolis spent Thursday cleaning up debris and boarding up windows after a night of protests, fires, looting and damage. Some business owners in south Minneapolis spent the previous night trying to protect their businesses from looters. Thursday night as more destruction spread, some businesses placed signs in their windows letting people know they were a minority-owned business. Governor Tim Walz announced Thursday he had signed an executive order to activate the Minnesota National Guard at the request of local leadership. Executive Order 20-65 authorizes the guard to work with local government agencies to provide ""personnel, equipment and facilities"" to help respond to the present emergency, according to a news release put out by the governor's office. “It is time to rebuild. Rebuild the city, rebuild our justice system, and rebuild the relationship between law enforcement and those they’re charged to protect. George Floyd’s death should lead to justice and systemic change, not more death and destruction. As George Floyd’s family has said, ‘Floyd would not want people to get hurt. He lived his life protecting people.’ Let’s come together to rebuild, remember, and seek justice for George Floyd,” said Governor Walz. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey announced Thursday that he had asked Walz to activate the guard to help local law enforcement, as protests escalated into violence and looting overnight Wednesday. In a statement put out on the Minnesota National Guard's Twitter handle, Major General Jon Jensen said, ""We are ready and prepared to answer the Governor's request. We are currently in process of assigning and preparing units to respond."" Nearly 200 Minnesota State Patrol troopers, along with State Patrol helicopters and fixed wind aircraft, will be at the disposal of state, county and local community public safety agencies. According to the release, the state's response will be conducted from the State Emergency Operations Center. Already activated under the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the site will now serve the dual task of helping to coordinate public health needs, as well as addressing safety issues surrounding the evolving tensions in Minneapolis. Frey and other city officials held a news conference earlier Thursday to address protests and unrest happening across Minneapolis. ""The emotion-ridden conflict over last night is the result of so much built-up anger and sadness,"" Frey said. ""Anger and sadness that has been ingrained in our black community, not just because of 5 minutes of horror, but 400 years.” Frey said that in the coming days there will be an all-out effort to restore peace in the city. City Council Vice President Andrea Jenkins stepped to the podium and said people have rights to express their anger, but should not do so by causing violence. ""We need peace and calm in our streets and I am begging you for that,"" Jenkins said. ""I have spent the last 41 years as a resident of this city and this is my home. And we cannot allow outsiders or our own Minneapolitan residents to destroy our city. So we want to work together to ensure that people have their voices heard in a safe manner. And that's my commitment."" Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo said he cannot allow criminal acts to threaten the safety of the city. He said he wants to create safe spaces for people to gather and grieve the death of George Floyd. ""I know that our community is in trauma and that they are trying to find ways to heal,"" Arradondo said. ""Even prior to Mr. Floyd's death we have had a community that has been in trauma for quite some time. What I cannot allow as chief is for others to compound that trauma."" Arradondo said most people gathered peacefully but that there were groups of people who were causing destruction. ""The vast majority of people that have come to gather have done so peacefully,"" Arradondo said. He added that there were people involved in the overnight unrest who did not appear to be local. ""There were certainly people who were involved in the activities last night who were certainly not recognized as being part of the city."" Mayor Frey added that businesses that were looted and damaged are ""staples in the community."" ""But more important, in the time of a pandemic they are essential for community needs,"" he said. Multiple buildings, including businesses, homes and a construction site were engulfed in flames Thursday morning as fire crews across Minneapolis worked to contain the blaze. The Minneapolis Fire Department says 911 logs show engines responded to approximately 30 fire events during the unrest along East Lake Street, including at least 16 that involved structures on fire. During those responses engines and equipment suffered damage from rocks and other objects thrown at them. Minneapolis fire personnel remain on scene Thursday putting down active fires and remaining hot spots. Fires broke out at businesses in the area of Lake Street after demonstrations following the police-involved death of Floyd turned chaotic. An AutoZone, a Cub Foods, and an apartment complex under construction were reportedly among the structures impacted by the fires. St. Paul Police spokesman Steve Linders confirmed that approximately 40 St. Paul officers had been deployed to protect and aid Minneapolis firefighters trying to put down the fires. Reports of looting and property damage began Wednesday night, as a peaceful protest following the death of George Floyd turned ""from bad to worse,"" according to KARE 11's Deevon Rahming, who was on scene for a number of hours. A spokesman for Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey confirms that the mayor has requested the assistance of the National Guard to help regain control of the situation. In other developments, multiple reports say the Rev. Jesse Jackson is headed for Minneapolis, and is expected to hold a news conference around 1 p.m. The Rev. Al Sharpton posted on his Twitter account that he is headed for the Twin Cities as well. Earlier Wednesday, Police Chief Medaria Arradondo urged people observing or participating in protests to do so with safety in mind. Arradondo says he is supportive of peaceful demonstrations, but says a small minority of those out on the streets are not focused on that, and emphasized that his department will not allow the safety of city residents to be jeopardized.",0.0

Brutality. Reprehensible. Indefensible. Police nationwide, in unequivocal and unprecedented language, have condemned the actions of Minneapolis police in the custody death of a handcuffed black man who cried for help as an officer knelt on his neck, pinning him to the pavement for at least eight minutes. But some civil rights advocates say their denunciations are empty words without meaningful reform behind them. Authorities say George Floyd was detained Monday because he matched the description of someone who tried to pay with a counterfeit bill at a convenience store, and the 46-year-old resisted arrest. A bystander's disturbing video shows Officer Derek Chauvin, who is white, kneeling on Floyd's neck, even as Floyd begs for air and slowly stops talking and moving. “There is no need to see more video,” Chattanooga, Tennessee, Police Chief David Roddy tweeted Wednesday. “There no need to wait to see how ‘it plays out’. There is no need to put a knee on someone’s neck for NINE minutes. There IS a need to DO something. If you wear a badge and you don’t have an issue with this ... turn it in.” There is no need to see more video. There no need to wait to see how “it plays out”.

Sheriffs and police chiefs have strongly criticized the Minneapolis officer on social media and praised the city’s police chief for his quick dismissal of four officers at the scene. Some even called for them to be criminally charged. “I am deeply disturbed by the video of Mr. Floyd being murdered in the street with other officers there letting it go on,” Polk County, Georgia, Sheriff Johnny Moats wrote on Facebook. “I can assure everyone, me or any of my deputies will never treat anyone like that as long as I’m Sheriff. This kind of brutality is terrible and it needs to stop. All Officers involved need to be arrested and charged immediately. Praying for the family.” Typically, police call for patience and calm in the wake of a use of force. They are reluctant to weigh in on episodes involving another agency, often citing ongoing investigations or due process. Not going hide behind “not being there.” I’d be one of the first to condemn anyone had I seen similar happen to one of my brother/ sister officers. What I saw happen to George Floyd disturbed me and is not consistent with the goal of our mission. The act of one, impacts us all. — Chief Eddie Garcia (@sjpdchief) May 27, 2020 “Not going hide behind ‘not being there,’"" tweeted San Jose Police, California, Chief Eddie Garcia. ”I’d be one of the first to condemn anyone had I seen similar happen to one of my brother/ sister officers. What I saw happen to George Floyd disturbed me and is not consistent with the goal of our mission. The act of one, impacts us all.” But Gloria Browne-Marshall, a civil rights attorney and professor at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice, said she wouldn't be a “cheerleader” for a “handful” of chiefs who harshly decried the officers' behavior. “Any minute progress is seen as miraculous because so little has been done for so long,” she said. “It’s nothing close to progress or what outrage would be taking place if it was a white man as the victim of this assault.” Melina Abdullah, co-founder of Black Lives Matter in Los Angeles, said she wasn't “particularly moved” by the relatively few police who voiced outrage. Abdullah said the three other officers who witnessed Chauvin's actions and did not intervene contributed to a long-standing system of police racism and oppression against people of color. “We’ve got to remember that it was not just Officer Chauvin who was sitting on George Floyd’s neck,” she said. Abdullah and hundreds of others protested what she called Floyd's lynching on Wednesday night. Some blocked lanes of a freeway and shattered windows of California Highway Patrol cruisers. Minneapolis is bracing for more violence after days of civil unrest, with burned buildings, looted stores and angry graffiti demanding justice. The governor on Thursday called in the National Guard. On Thursday night, protesters torched a Minneapolis police station that the department was forced to abandon. The heads of the Los Angeles and Chicago departments — both of which have been rocked before by police brutality scandals — addressed Floyd's death and its potential effect on race relations between law enforcement and communities of color. Even the New York Police Department weighed in. Eric Garner died in the city in 2014 after he was placed in a chokehold by police and uttered the same words Floyd did: “I can't breathe.” It took city officials five years to fire the officer, and no criminal or federal charges were brought. #GeorgeFloyd died on the ground under the knee of a Minneapolis police officer.

This is not acceptable ANYWHERE.” Before he was commissioner, Shea spearheaded the NYPD’s shift to community policing that moved away from a more confrontational style favored by other commissioners after Garner's death.

Andy Beshear read the statement from Breonna Taylor’s mother hours after gunshots erupted during protests late Thursday outside City Hall. One person was in critical condition, Louisville Metro Police said Friday. Mayor Greg Fischer said police officers fired no shots. Instead, they provided aid to the wounded, he said. TV video showed terrified protesters fleeing as gunfire erupted. With more rallies planned, Taylor's mother joined the chorus of calls for protests to remain peaceful. In her statement, Tamika Palmer said her daughter — an emergency medical technician — devoted her life to others and the ""last thing she'd want right now is any more violence."" ""Please keep saying her name,"" her statement said. ""Please keep demanding justice and accountability, but let's do it the right way without hurting each other. We can and we will make some real change here. Now is the time. Let's make it happen, but safely."" On Friday evening, what appeared to be several hundred people gathered downtown for the second night of protests. The crowd briefly blocked traffic near City Hall and chanted, ""No justice, no peace."" Protesters carried signs calling for justice for Breonna Taylor and George Floyd, the black man who died after a Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee into Floyd's neck for several minutes even after he stopped moving and pleading for air. Police presence intensified around 9:45 p.m. Friday, as officers in riot gear stood shoulder-to-shoulder moving people down a key street near City Hall, the Courier Journal reported. A police officer was seen on camera during a WAVE-TV broadcast firing what appeared to be pepper bullets directly at the camera crew. ""I'm getting shot! I'm getting shot!"" WAVE-TV reporter Kaitlin Rust is heard yelling off-camera. She told the indignant anchors int he studio that the crew was behind the line, but police wanted them to move further away. Police spokeswoman Jessie Halladay said no shots had been fired at Friday's protest as of 10:40 p.m. and no significant injuries had been reported. Two people were arrested. Bracing for more protests, police said they wouldn't tolerate violence or property destruction. ""We value the right to free speech and understand this community has a lot to say right now,"" Louisville police Lt. Col. LaVita Chavous said. ""We hear you."" But she added that police were prepared to ""take whatever action we must to try to ensure no one else is injured during this time of unrest. We ask the community to please voice your opinions in a peaceful way."" Meanwhile, Louisville's mayor said the use of no-knock warrants by police was being suspended, the latest in a series of policy changes and others actions in response to Taylor's death. ""To the people who gathered downtown last night to protest, and to many more throughout our city and throughout our country who feel angry, hurt, afraid, frustrated, tired and sick of story after story of black lives ending at the hands of law enforcement, I hear you,"" Fischer said. Two people wounded in the gunfire underwent surgery, while five were in good condition, he said. Beshear, speaking on CNN, said Thursday's protest started peacefully but some people later ""turned it into something that it should not have been."" Local Councilwoman Keisha Dorsey termed the protest as ""a revolt against a system in which people have felt oppressed,"" the Courier Journal reported. ""What I'm seeing is people who are trying their best to do something with their hurt, their pain and their frustration."" The Louisville protests followed the release of a 911 call Taylor’s boyfriend made on March 13, moments after the 26-year-old EMT was shot eight times by narcotics detectives who knocked down her front door. No drugs were found in the home. Hundreds of demonstrators marched through downtown Louisville, ending in the early hours of Friday as rain poured down. Windows were broken and several vehicles were damaged during the unrest, police said. Shots were fired into government buildings, including police headquarters, they said. Bricks were thrown into buildings and graffiti was splashed in several places, including a firefighter memorial, they said. The police description of the damage made no reference to any looting. Jordan Basham, a 24-year-old white bartender, said she was a few feet from where the people were shot. As people fled in terror, a man she didn't know pushed her to the ground, told her not to move and used his own body to shield her, she said Friday. ""I'll never be able to get that picture out of my mind,"" she said. ""But I am still very glad that I was there. As long as they're out there protesting, I'll be back."" Many protesters wore masks as Kentuckians are strongly urged to follow health guidelines to contain the coronavirus pandemic. Attention on Taylor's death has intensified since her family sued the police department this month. The case has attracted national headlines alongside the shooting of Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia in February and the recent death of Floyd. Copyright 2020 Associated Press. All rights reserved.",0.0

(Facebook/Darnella Frazier/CNN) On Minneapolis' south side, officers fired tear gas and rubber bullets to drive back crowds of protesters who then set cars and businesses on fire and broke into stores, including some near a police station. Shortly before midnight, scores of officers on foot and in vehicles moved in to curb the violence a day after city and state leaders faced blowback for their handling of the crisis. Protesters on Thursday torched a police station soon after it was abandoned by police and vandalized dozens of businesses. The Pentagon took the rare step Friday of ordering the Army to put several active-duty U.S. military police units on the ready to deploy to Minneapolis, according to three people with direct knowledge of the orders who did not want their names used because they were not authorized to discuss the preparations. Ben Hubert, 26, of Minneapolis, said he wasn't surprised people were breaking curfew and setting fires. ""I'm outraged,"" he said of the Floyd case. ""But I'm also sad. The injustice has been going on for so long. It's been swelling for years."" Downtown, thousands of protesters encircled a police station after the 8 p.m. curfew. ""Prosecute the police!"" some chanted, and ""Say his name: George Floyd!"" There was no violence, though some protesters sprayed graffiti on buildings. The renewed protests came after Officer Derek Chauvin, 44, was charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. He also was accused of ignoring another officer who expressed concerns about Floyd as he lay handcuffed on the ground, pleading that he could not breathe while Chauvin pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes. Floyd, who was black, had been arrested on suspicion of using a counterfeit bill at a store. Chauvin, who was fired along with three other officers who were at the scene, faces more than 12 years in prison if convicted of murder. An attorney for Floyd's family welcomed the arrest but said he expected a more serious murder charge and wants the other officers arrested, too. Prosecutor Mike Freeman said more charges were possible, but authorities ""felt it appropriate to focus on the most dangerous perpetrator."" As the night dragged on, more fires erupted on the south side: A Japanese restaurant, a Wells Fargo bank, another restaurant, an Office Depot. Many burned for hours. Mayor Jacob Frey tweeted that firefighters could not respond until areas were secure. He said the city was working with the National Guard and the state to ""provide support in the south."" Protests nationwide have been fueled by outrage over Floyd's death and years of police violence against African Americans. Protesters smashed windows at CNN headquarters in Atlanta, set a police car on fire and struck officers with bottles. Large demonstrations in New York, Houston, Washington, D.C., and dozens of other cities ranged from people peacefully blocking roads to repeated clashes with police. ""You are disgracing our city,"" Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms told protesters. ""You are disgracing the life of George Floyd and every other person who has been killed in this country."" Police were trying to put Floyd in a squad car Monday when he stiffened and fell to the ground, saying he was claustrophobic, a criminal complaint said. Chauvin and Officer Tou Thoa arrived and tried several times to get the struggling Floyd into the car. Chauvin eventually pulled Floyd out of the car, and the handcuffed Floyd went to the ground face down. Officer J.K. Kueng held Floyd's back and Officer Thomas Lane held his legs while Chauvin put his knee on Floyd's head and neck area, the complaint said. When Lane asked if Floyd should be rolled onto his side, Chauvin said, ""No, staying put is where we got him."" Lane said he was ""worried about excited delirium or whatever."" An autopsy said the combined effects of being restrained, potential intoxicants in Floyd's system and his underlying health issues, including heart disease, likely contributed to his death. It revealed nothing to support strangulation as the cause of death. There were no other details about intoxicants, and toxicology results can take weeks. In the 911 call that drew police, the caller describes the man suspected of paying with counterfeit money as ""awfully drunk and he's not in control of himself."" After Floyd apparently stopped breathing, Lane again said he wanted to roll Floyd onto his side. Kueng checked for a pulse and said he could not find one, according to the complaint. Chauvin had his knee on Floyd's neck for 8 minutes, 46 seconds, including nearly three minutes after Floyd stopped moving and talking, the complaint said. Chauvin's attorney had no comment when reached by The Associated Press. The prosecutor highlighted the ""extraordinary speed"" in charging the case four days after Floyd's death and defended himself against questions about why it did not happen sooner. Freeman said his office needed time to gather evidence, including what he called the ""horrible"" video recorded by a bystander. News of the arrest came moments after Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz acknowledged the ""abject failure"" in responding to this week's protests and called for swift justice for the officers. Walz said the state took the lead after the police station burned. ""Minneapolis and St. Paul are on fire. The fire is still smoldering in our streets. The ashes are symbolic of decades and generations of pain, of anguish unheard,"" Walz said. President Donald Trump said Friday that he'd spoken to Floyd's family and ""expressed my sorrow."" He called video of the arrest ""just a horrible thing to witness and to watch. It certainly looked like there was no excuse for it."" Attorney Benjamin Crump, who is representing Floyd's family, asked to take custody of Floyd's body for an independent autopsy. The doctor who will do the autopsy is Michael Baden, former chief medical examiner of New York City, who was hired to do an autopsy for Eric Garner, a black man who died in 2014 after New York police placed him in a chokehold and he pleaded that he could not breathe. State and federal authorities also are investigating Floyd's death. ___ Associated Press writers Steve Karnowski, Aaron Morrison and Doug Glass in Minneapolis, Gretchen Ehlke in Milwaukee, Bernard Condon in New York, and James LaPorta in Delray Beach, Fla., contributed to this report.

Tim Walz promised that journalists would not be interfered with in reporting on violent protests following the death of George Floyd. CNN reporter Omar Jimenez was arrested live on air from the unrest in Minneapolis on Friday morning. (Source: CNN) CNN correspondent Omar Jimenez and two colleagues were released within an hour after network chief executive Jeff Zucker called Walz to demand answers about why they were led away and held in a police van. ""We have got to ensure that there is a safe spot for journalism to tell this story,"" Walz said. Jimenez and colleagues Bill Kirkos and Leonel Mendez were doing a live shot for CNN's ""New Day"" shortly after 5 a.m. Central Time, describing a night of fire and anger in the wake of Floyd's death after a Minneapolis police office knelt on his neck. Fired officer Derek Chauvin was charged with murder in that case later Friday. When first approached by officers, Jimenez, who is black, told them, ""put us back where you want us. We are getting out of your way."" After being told he was being arrested and his hands were tied behind his back, Jimenez asked why he was being arrested. He did not get an answer. The Minnesota State Patrol said on Twitter that the journalists were among four people arrested as troopers were ""clearing the streets and restoring order"" following the protests. The patrol said the CNN journalists ""were released once they were confirmed to be members of the media."" It's not clear why they were confused: Jimenez was holding what appeared to be a laminated ID card before his hands were secured, and his fellow crew members told police that they were from CNN and showing the scene live on the air. ""I've never seen anything like this,"" CNN ""New Day"" co-anchor John Berman said. After being released, Jimenez said that he was glad that his arrest was shown on the air. ""You don't have to doubt my story,"" he said. ""It's not filtered in any way. You saw it for your own eyes. That gave me a little bit of comfort. But it was definitely nerve-wracking."" At a later news conference, Walz said that ""I take full responsibility. There is absolutely no reason something like that should happen ... This is a very public apology to that team."" The arrest drew widespread condemnation across the news industry. CNN competitors MSNBC, CBS News and Fox News all issued statements in support of Jimenez, along with the Society of Professional Journalists and the National Association of Black Journalists. CNN accepted Walz's apology, saying the network appreciated the sincerity of his words. Walz's words in support of journalists have impact at a time when the news media is often under attack, said Jane E. Kirtley, Silha Professor of Media Ethics and Law and director of the Silha Center at the University of Minnesota. ""It's really important for the governor to make that kind of statement to emphasize to everyone, especially law enforcement, that the press has an important job to do ... and they need to be respected,"" said Kirtley, who lives blocks away from the protests and could still smell smoke from the fires on Friday. Later Friday, the network was again thrust into the story when hundreds of protesters confronted police outside CNN's downtown Atlanta headquarters. Activists spray-painted a large CNN logo outside the building, breaking a window and tagging doors. One protester climbed on top of the CNN sign and waved a ""Black Lives Matter"" flag to cheers from the crowd. As anchor Chris Cuomo opened his prime-time show, he told viewers the network's headquarters had been ""swarmed and defaced."" Footage of the damage outside was mixed with scenes from other protests around the country. Correspondent Nick Valencia reported from inside the building as protesters hurled objects at the building and police. ""This is our home, Chris, you know, this is where we come to work every day, journalists who are trying to tell the truth, trying to deliver information. ... And these demonstrators have decided to come here today to take our their frustration and anger it seems not just on police but on our CNN center as well,"" Valencia said. Meanwhile, there were signs Friday that cable news networks, who were spending much of their time covering the story, have become sensitive to the impact of showing witness video of Floyd's treatment by police. News anchors on all three networks usually warned viewers of its graphic nature before showing the video. ""I must warn you that this is difficult to watch,"" said CNN's Brianna Keilar, ""but it is important to remember."" ___ Associated Press writers Gretchen Ehlke in Milwaukee and Aaron Morrison in New York and Television Writer Lynn Elber in Los Angeles contributed to this report.

National Guard moves to Minneapolis as protests over George Floyd's death continue Miles away from the sites of looting and vandalism in St. Paul, thousands gathered for a peaceful demonstration downtown Thursday evening, May 28. For a third day, demonstrators convened near the site where George Floyd was held down by a Minneapolis police officer who knelt on his neck as he said he couldn't breathe. Thousands marched through the streets and called for the prosecution of four police officers on the scene during the incident. After about four hours, protesters were met with stun grenades and tear gas from police after some demonstrators threw objects at officers around 9 p.m. Thursday. State and federal investigators and prosecutors said work on parallel investigations into the death were ongoing and they asked for additional information from witnesses to help fill out the framework of what happened. They urged those calling for quick answers to remain calm and give them time. Read more listen live watch live 2.

Officials have heard of instances of landlords, property managers and other rental workers exploiting individuals by harassing them, including with sexual misconduct. “Anybody thinking that this is an opportunity for them to somehow exploit another human being or somehow leverage someone’s economic suffering needs to think about that twice,” Wrigley told The Forum. Wrigley’s office has not received any such reports, and most landlords in the state have worked with tenants who cannot pay rent, he said. Wrigley said he wants tenants to know they have rights.

The manufacturing partnership, which involves Aldevron and two other biotechnology firms, was announced Thursday, May 28, and involves first-phase clinical studies that will begin later this year. The experimental COVID-19 vaccine uses a harmless, adeno-associated virus to create a vehicle to insert genetic material into the body, serving as a vaccine. Aldevron’s role in the project will be to manufacture what’s called plasmid DNA. The tiny, circular snippets of genetic material are combined with bacteria, grown in controlled conditions to massively replicate the DNA, which then is removed from the bacteria and purified in a series of steps.

State police detained CNN correspondent Omar Jimenez, his producer and his photojournalist shortly after 5 a.m. CT (6 a.m. ET) as Jimenez was reporting live from a street south of downtown, near where a police precinct was earlier set ablaze. Jimenez could be seen holding his CNN badge while reporting, identifying himself as a reporter, and telling the officers the crew would move wherever officers needed them to. An officer gripped his arm as Jimenez talked, then put him in handcuffs. listen live watch live ""We can move back to where you like. We are live on the air here. ... Put us back where you want us. We are getting out of your way -- wherever you want us (we'll) get out of your way,"" Jimenez said to police before he was led away. ""We were just getting out of your way when you were advancing through the intersection,"" Jimenez continued. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz told CNN Worldwide President Jeff Zucker that he deeply apologizes for what happened and would work to have the crew released. Stelter: Arresting reporters at a protest is an affront to the First Amendment Jimenez and the others -- producer Bill Kirkos and photojournalist Leonel Mendez -- were taken to the city's downtown public safety building, but were released after 6 a.m. CT. Jimenez, after his release, reported live outside from downtown and said he'd been treated cordially after he'd been led away. ""We're doing OK, now. There were a few uneasy moments there,"" Jimenez said. The Minneapolis State Patrol said this about the incident: ""In the course of clearing the streets and restoring order at Lake Street and Snelling Avenue, four people were arrested by State Patrol troopers, including three members of a CNN crew. The three were released once they were confirmed to be members of the media."" CNN disputed the state police characterization in a statement on Twitter. ""This is not accurate - our CNN crew identified themselves, on live television, immediately as journalists. We thank Minnesota @GovTimWalz for his swift action this morning to aid in the release of our crew."" Another CNN reporter was 'treated much differently' CNN's Josh Campell, who also was in the area but not standing with the on-air crew, said he, too, was approached by police, but was allowed to remain. ""I identified myself ... they said, 'OK, you're permitted to be in the area,'"" recounted Campbell, who is white. ""I was treated much differently than (Jimenez) was."" Jimenez is black and Latino. ""A CNN reporter and his production team were arrested this morning in Minneapolis for doing their jobs, despite identifying themselves -- a clear violation of their First Amendment rights. The authorities in Minnesota, including the Governor, must release the three CNN employees immediately,"" CNN said in a statement shortly after their arrest. Former Philadelphia police commissioner Charles Ramsey, a CNN law enforcement analyst, said the arrest made no sense. ""State police are going to have a lot to answer for this arrest here,"" Ramsey said. ""(Jimenez is) standing there ... you can see his credential. Just move him where you want to be."" ""They should have a designated (media) area, and just tell them to move to that area."" The arrest The crew members were handcuffed and detained as Jimenez gave a live report on a Minneapolis street. A line of state troopers had just arrived at the area, which city police seemed to have abandoned for hours overnight after the police precinct building was set on fire. Intermittently, an officer told people over a loudspeaker to ""disperse immediately"" or face arrest. Troopers were advancing down the street and soon approached the three-person crew while moving in to arrest a fourth person behind them. Police told the crew they were being detained because they were told to move, and didn't, one member of the CNN crew relayed to the network. After the CNN photojournalist was detained, his camera was set on the ground and continued to transmit live images. Jimenez and the crew had been reporting from the site, near a city police department precinct that protesters had burned and officers had abandoned overnight. About a block away, a fire was burning at a different, four-story building that had contained restaurants. Over 100 state police officers in body armor and riot gear had arrived shortly before 5 a.m. CT and lined up near the area where the CNN crew was, near the precinct building on East Lake Street. For a portion of time overnight -- from sometime after city police abandoned the precinct building that was set ablaze -- police weren't in the area until the troopers arrived Friday morning, Jimenez had reported. The four-story event and restaurant building was burning unabated, and people were throwing things into the flames, Jimenez said.

1620314981,2020-05-29 13:42:15,Trump to speak on China as it pushes for more control in Hong Kong,https://www.valleynewslive.com/content/news/Trump-to-speak-on-China-as-it-pushes-for-more-control-in-Hong-Kong--570869191.html,en,True,,86247,valleynewslive.com,http://www.valleynewslive.com/#spider,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump announced Friday he would withdraw funding from the World Health Organization, end Hong Kong’s special trade status and suspend visas of Chinese graduate students suspected of conducting research on behalf of their government — escalating tensions with China that have surged during the coronavirus pandemic. Trump has been expressing anger at the World Health Organization for weeks over what he has portrayed as an inadequate response to the initial outbreak of the coronavirus in China’s Wuhan province late last year. The president said in a White House announcement that Chinese officials “ignored” their reporting obligations to the WHO and pressured the organization to mislead the public about an outbreak that has now killed more than 100,000 people in the United States. “We have detailed the reforms that it must make and engaged with them directly, but they have refused to act,” the president said. “Because they have failed to make the requested and greatly needed reforms, we will be today terminating the relationship.” The U.S. is the largest source of financial support for the WHO and its exit is expected to significantly weaken the organization. Trump said the U.S. would be “redirecting” the money to “other worldwide and deserving urgent global public health needs,” without providing specifics. He noted that the U.S. contributes about $450 million to the world body while China provides about $40 million. Critics of the administration’s decision to cut funding called it misguided, saying it would undermine an important institution that is leading vaccine development efforts and drug trials to address the COVID-19 outbreak. “Severing ties with the World Health Organization serves no logical purpose and makes finding a way out of this public health crisis dramatically more challenging,” said Dr. Patrice Harris, president of the American Medical Association. Sen. Chris Murphy called it a distraction that would “hand over” the organization to China. “Leaving castrates our ability to stop future pandemics and elevates China as the world’s go-to power on global health,” said the Connecticut Democrat. The WHO declined to comment on the announcement. Officials of the U.N. agency have not directly addressed a letter that Trump sent to the general director on May 18, warning he would make permanent a temporary freeze on U.S. funding and reconsider U.S. membership unless it committed to “major substantive improvements within the next 30 days.” Tennessee Republican Sen. Lamar Alexander, chairman of the Senate health committee, also warned that the president’s decision could interfere with vaccine trials and international cooperation during future outbreaks. “Certainly there needs to be a good, hard look at mistakes the World Health Organization might have made in connection with coronavirus, but the time to do that is after the crisis has been dealt with, not in the middle of it,” said Alexander, echoing a point made by others, including the head of the United Nations. At a later event Friday, Trump was asked about relations with China and he repeated his earlier suspicions about how the country managed to apparently contain the virus in Wuhan while it spread to Europe and the United States. “Well, we’re certainly not happy with what happened with respect to China,” he told reporters. Tensions over Hong Kong have been increasing over the past year year as China has cracked down on protesters a nd sought to exert more control over the former British territory. Trump said the administration would begin eliminating the “full range” of agreements that had given Hong Kong a relationship with the U.S. that mainland China lacked, including exemptions from controls on certain exports. He said the State Department would begin warning U.S. citizens of the threat of surveillance and arrest when visiting the city. “China has replaced its promised formula of one country, two systems, with one country, one system,” he said. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo notified Congress on Wednesday that Hong Kong is no longer deserving of the preferential trade and commercial status it has enjoyed from the U.S. since it reverted to Chinese rule in 1997. It’s not yet clear what impact the decision will have on U.S. companies that operate in Hong Kong or on the city’s position as Asia’s major financial hub, or how China will react to the decision. “The downward spiral in the bilateral relationship has now reached lows not seen since the June 4, 1989, Tiananmen massacre, and there is little reason to expect things to get better soon,” said Dexter Tiff Roberts, an Asia expert at the Atlantic Council, which publishes non-partisan policy analysis. Rep. Chris Smith, a New Jersey Republican who is a commissioner of the Congressional Executive Commission on China, praised the decision on Hong Kong as an overdue response to the government of President Xi Jinping for human rights abuses, including against religious minorities in the Xinjiang region. “After years of human rights admonishment and cheap rhetoric devoid of any meaningful penalties, Xi has concluded that the West is all talk, no action,” Smith said. “President Trump, however, is today beginning to change that and is doing what previous presidents have failed to do.” The president also said the U.S. would be suspending entry of Chinese graduate students who are suspected of taking part in an extensive government campaign to acquire trade knowledge and academic research for the country’s military and industrial development. Allowing their continued entry to the country would be “detrimental to the interests of the United States,” Trump said in an order released after the White House announcement. Revocation of the visas has faced opposition from U.S. universities and scientific organizations that depend on tuition fees paid by Chinese students to offset other costs and fear possible reciprocal action from Beijing that could limit their access to China. The order issued by the president included an exemptions for students whose work was not expected to benefit the Chinese military. China seemed to signal in recent days that it was hoping to ease tensions. Premier Li Keqiang told reporters on Thursday that both countries stood to gain from cooperation, and to lose from confrontation, because their economies have become so interconnected. “We must use our wisdom to expand common interests and manage differences and disagreements,” Li said. Still, the country has insisted that its control of Hong Kong is an internal matter and it has disputed that it mishandled the response to the virus. —— Associated Press writers Kevin Freking in Washington and Jamey Keaten in Geneva contributed to this report.

Minnesota Department of Public Safety Commissioner John Mark Harrington reappeared at the podium Friday after a news conference ended, saying that the BCA has arrested Chauvin. He did not have any information about specific charges. Multiple sources confirmed to KARE 11 that Chauvin was the officer seen on video with his knee on Floyd's neck before he died. Governor Tim Walz held the news conference at 10:30 a.m. after another night of violence and looting in Minneapolis and St. Paul, as protests over the death of George Floyd while in police custody devolved into riots. Walz called the lack of protection for businesses that burned in parts of the Twin Cities overnight an ""abject failure"" in a Friday news conference. Walz spoke to the public Walz said he received a call from State Sen. Patricia Torres Ray Thursday that District 63 was burning, and there were no police officers or Minnesota National Guard troops to help. “That is an abject failure that cannot happen,"" Walz said. ""We must restore that order.” Harrington said that national guard troops were called in to help Thursday, but they did not receive a “specific mission” to help clear the streets until midnight, on a call with the mayor. Harrington said Minneapolis Mayor Frey informed them they had ""no more resources"" and they were not able to meet public safety needs on Lake Street. ""When the Third Precinct was abandoned, it seemed that that was the time to move,"" Gov. Walz said. They then had to get a plan together, Harrington said. By the time they brought state patrol, Minnesota National Guard, and other assisting crews to Lake Street, he said it was 3 a.m. They arrested some people at that time and for other looting incidents throughout the day, Harrington said, but he did not have numbers on how many. He said most people left peacefully. Harrington said the people who were out at that hour were not the people of Minneapolis “who are still having their guts ripped out about the Floyd murder.” “I don’t want to prejudice this,” he said regarding using the term “murder.” “I’m just calling it like I see it.” “I can tell you that no one could have heard Mr. Floyd’s voice in the chaos of the screaming and the shouting and the fires at 1 o’clock in the morning on Lake Street,” he said. “My job is to make sure the community is safe and the team is ready and prepared to keep it safe.” Harrington said his team, including the national guard, state troopers and DNR, is confident that they can make a plan to keep people safe Friday night while protecting First Amendment rights to protest. “We will create a plan that will keep the peace, maintain the peace, and prevent further lawless behavior in the city of Minneapolis, the city of St. Paul and surrounding suburbs,” he said. The governor acknowledged that the ""tools"" needed to restore order, including the Minnesota National Guard, are ""the very same tools that have led to that grief and pain."" Those national guard troops are armed, officials confirmed Friday, and maintain the right to defend themselves, though they would not comment further on the boundaries around their use of force. ""I’m asking you to help us. Help us use a humane way to get the streets to a place where we can restore the justice,"" he said. ""So those who are demanding justice can be heard. Not those who throw fire bombs into businesses."" Walz said that he has spoken with Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman and he is confident that ""justice will be swift, that it will come in a timely manner, and that it will be fair."" ""You're seeing holes in planning,"" Walz said, ""that's for dang sure."" He said Minnesotans can expect to hear what the plan is for Friday night by 2 p.m. ""Tonight needs to be different,"" Walz said. He promised that state troops would step into the gap. State Attorney General Keith Ellison quoted Martin Luther King, Jr., when he asked Minnesotans not to disregard riots as only senseless violence. ""Ask yourself, what’s going on there?"" he said. ""And is it something that we as a society absolutely must pay attention to? I think we must pay attention."" Ellison pointed out that as Minnesota National Guard troops are deployed to maintain order, they are the same people who were administering COVID-19 tests across the state last week. ""Don’t react to them the way you might react to the Minneapolis Police Department,"" he said. ""It’s not the same group. They have different leadership, different authority, and their job is to try to bring peace and calm back again. Please remember that this is not the group you associate with unfair conduct."" Walz said Friday that he believes the public has ""lost faith"" in the Minneapolis Police Department. The state's response came as businesses and homes continued to burn Thursday night and Friday morning. Just after 10:30 p.m., a crowd stormed the building housing the Minneapolis Police Department's Third Precinct, setting it on fire. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey held a press conference just after 1 a.m. to address the continued unrest across the city. Frey said rioting posed an imminent threat to the safety of the officers and staffers within MPD's Third Precinct, forcing him to make the decision to evacuate the compound. “Symbolism of a building cannot outweigh the importance of life or the public,” Frey said. “We could not risk serious injury to anyone… brick and mortar is not as important as life.”",0.0

Tim Walz on Friday acknowledged the ""abject failure"" of the response to this week's violent protests and called for swift justice for police involved in the death of George Floyd, a handcuffed black man who pleaded for air as a white officer knelt on his neck. Walz said the state would take over the response and that it's time to show respect and dignity to those who are suffering. ""Minneapolis and St. Paul are on fire. The fire is still smoldering in our streets. The ashes are symbolic of decades and generations of pain, of anguish unheard,"" Walz said, adding. ""Now generations of pain is manifesting itself in front of the world — and the world is watching."" The governor cited a call he received from a state senator who described her district ""on fire, no police, no firefighters, no social control, constituents locked in houses wondering what they were going to do. That is an abject failure that cannot happen."" His comments came the morning after protesters torched a police station that officers abandoned during a third night of violence. Livestream video showed protesters entering the building, where intentionally set fires activated smoke alarms and sprinklers. President Donald Trump threatened action, tweeting ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts,"" which prompted a warning from Twitter for ""glorifying violence."" The governor faced tough questions after National Guard leader Maj. Gen. Jon Jensen blamed a lack of clarity about the Guard's mission for a slow response. Walz said the state was in a supporting role and that it was up to city leaders to run the situation. Walz said it became apparent as the 3rd Precinct was lost that the state had to step in, which happened at 12:05 a.m. Requests from the cities for resources ""never came,"" he said. ""You will not see that tonight, there will be no lack of leadership,"" Walz said. Dozens of fires were also set in nearby St. Paul, where nearly 200 businesses were damaged or looted. Protests spread across the U.S., fueled by outrage over Floyd's death, and years of violence against African Americans at the hands of police. Demonstrators clashed with officers in New York and blocked traffic in Columbus, Ohio, and Denver. Trump threatened to bring Minneapolis ""under control,"" calling the protesters ""thugs"" and tweeting that ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts."" The tweet drew another warning from Twitter, which said the comment violated the platform's rules, but the company did not remove it. Trump also blasted the ""total lack of leadership"" in Minneapolis. A visibly tired and frustrated Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey made his first public appearance of the night early Friday at City Hall and took responsibility for evacuating the precinct, saying it had become too dangerous for officers. As Frey continued, a reporter cut across loudly with a question: ""What's the plan here?"" ""With regard to?"" Frey responded. Then he added: ""There is a lot of pain and anger right now in our city. I understand that ... What we have seen over the past several hours and past couple of nights here in terms of looting is unacceptable."" He defended the city's lack of engagement with looters — only a handful of arrests across the first two nights of violence — and said, ""We are doing absolutely everything that we can to keep the peace."" He said National Guard members were stationed in locations to help stem looting, including at banks, grocery stores and pharmacies. The Minnesota State Patrol arrested a CNN television crew early Friday as the journalists reported on the unrest. While live on air, CNN reporter Omar Jimenez was handcuffed and led away. A producer and a photojournalist for CNN were also taken away in handcuffs. The Minnesota State Patrol said the journalists were among four people arrested as troopers were ""clearing the streets and restoring order,"" and they were released after being confirmed to be media members. CNN said on Twitter that the arrests were ""a clear violation of their First Amendment rights."" Firefighters worked Friday to contain a number of blazes as National Guard troops blocked access to streets where businesses had been damaged. They marched side by side and block by block as they expanded a perimeter around a heavily damaged area. Protests first erupted Tuesday, a day after Floyd's death in a confrontation with police captured on widely seen citizen video. In the footage, Floyd can be seen pleading as officer Derek Chauvin presses his knee against him. As minutes pass, Floyd slowly stops talking and moving. Minutes after the precinct burned, the Guard tweeted that it had activated more than 500 soldiers across the metro area. By Friday morning, a couple dozen Guard members armed with assault-style rifles blocked a street near a Target store that has sustained heavy damage by looters. The Guard said a ""key objective"" was to make sure firefighters could respond to calls, and said in a follow-up tweet that soldiers would assist the Minneapolis Fire Department. But no move was made to put out the 3rd Precinct fire. Assistant Fire Chief Bryan Tyner said fire crews could not safely respond to blazes at the precinct station and some surrounding buildings. Elsewhere in Minneapolis, thousands of peaceful demonstrators marched through the streets calling for justice. In New York City, protesters defied New York's coronavirus prohibition on public gatherings Thursday, clashing with police, while demonstrators blocked traffic in downtown Denver and downtown Columbus. A day earlier, demonstrators had taken to the streets in Los Angeles and Memphis. About 10 protesters went to a Florida home believed to belong to Chauvin. The Orange County Sheriff's Office tweeted Friday that Chauvin was not at the residence and has no plans to be in the area. In Louisville, Kentucky, police confirmed that at least seven people had been shot Thursday night as protesters demanded justice for Breonna Taylor, a black woman who was fatally shot by police in her home in March. In Mississippi, the mayor of the community of Petal resisted calls to resign following his remarks about Floyd's death. Hal Marx, a Republican, asked on Twitter: ""Why in the world would anyone choose to become a police officer in our society today?"" In a follow-up tweet, he said he ""didn't see anything unreasonable."" The city on Thursday released a transcript of the 911 call that brought police to the grocery store where Floyd was arrested. The caller described someone paying with a counterfeit bill, with workers rushing outside to find the man sitting on a van. The caller described the man as ""awfully drunk"" and said he was ""not in control of himself."" Asked by the 911 operator whether the man was ""under the influence of something,"" the caller said: ""Something like that, yes. He is not acting right."" Police said Floyd matched the caller's description of the suspect. State and federal authorities are investigating Floyd's death. Chauvin, the officer who knelt on Floyd's neck, was fired Tuesday, along with three other officers involved in the arrest. ___ Associated Press writers Steve Karnowski, Jeff Baenen and Doug Glass in Minneapolis, Gretchen Ehlke in Milwaukee, and Aaron Morrison in New York contributed to this report.",0.0

Police said officers were able to safely evacuate as rioters breached the perimeter and started a fire that spread through the building. Shortly after, city officials warned protesters to move from the building after receiving reports that gas lines may have been cut. They urged people to move away from the building. In a tweet, Mayor Jacob Frey said the fire department is working to respond to the fires that have been set. However, he added, “We all need to work together to ensure the safety of our friends, family, and Minneapolis residents. And right now working together means clearing the area.” Frey said he made the decision to sacrifice the building and call off officers as rioters moved in. He told reporters early Friday morning that the decision came down to safety for both officers but members of the public. “Brick and mortar is not as important as life,” Frey said. As for other city officials, in an appearance on CNN, Minneapolis Fire Chief John Fruetel appeared unaware that the 3rd Precinct was on fire or rioters had gained entry to it until anchor Don Lemon told him live on the air. “That’s very possible. I apologize for that,” Fruetel said. He said he just came from another fire. Fruetel said on CNN that the fire department would have to assess the scene before deciding to send in crews. Firefighters have had “projectiles” thrown at them at other fires, Fruetel said. He said the windows of his chief’s car have been blown out by rocks and other objects. Speaking with FOX 9, Fruetel confirmed that some National Guard soldiers had moved into the city but only 35 were made available to the department as of about midnight. The Guard said 500 soldiers had been mobilized to the metro. Earlier in the evening, flames could be seen shooting from the corner of the police station along Lake Street with a large crowd surrounded the building as protests once again turned violent on Thursday. It all comes hours after a night of violence in Minneapolis sparked by the death of George Floyd in police custody. After protests throughout the day, looters seized on the chaos, breaking into businesses and making off with whatever they could get their hands on. Others set fires that burned an AutoZone location along with a construction project and also left damage to a number of other businesses. Thursday, it was much of the same. FOX 9 witnessed a group bust into a building and work to ignite a fire along Lake Street near the precinct. Several cars were also set ablaze by rioters. Businesses that had boarded up their windows, after having glass smashed in the night before, were again targeted by looters who took down the boards once again. Our helicopter also spotted flames shooting from a pawn shop not far from the 3rd Precinct.

In the aftermath of four Minneapolis police officers killing George Floyd, one of my worst fears has been realized: too many of us have become distracted by the riots in the Twin Cities. Don’t get me wrong. It is certainly a story, it just should never be the story. listen live watch live Not all of us have been distracted, though. There’s been support as many of us in the country grieve. One particular item that’s been encouraging has been from the people in blue. Police chiefs from Florida, Texas, Arizona, Oklahoma and others from states across the country have condemned the actions that took place on Chicago Avenue on Monday night. In these situations, the police generally back the police, but the heroes that protect and serve this nation were swift in joining in on the disgust. Less swiftly, after four days, those actions have (finally) resulted in the arrest of Derek Chauvin, the former Minneapolis police officer that had his knee on the back of Floyd’s neck and refused to ease up despite Floyd’s final pleas to breathe. The charges are third-degree murder and manslaugther. The focus should remain on Monday night. The focus should shift toward the courts and a possible conviction. The focus needs to be on actual change. But in just four days, the focus has taken some hits. Fires set ablaze on buildings. Windows smashed. Looting. All of which have overshadowed the peaceful protestors who just asked that people from a particular community not to be treated like they are disposable. That was my initial concern as this became the top news story in the nation. In a week, what are we, as a whole, going to be talking about? I was also concerned with the innocent lives affected by the riots. Workers and small business owners suddenly find themselves with a further uphill climb during a painfully tough economic time. Sure, Target and other billion-dollar companies likely will be able to recover and quickly rebuild while the other businesses probably have insurance on their buildings to help clean up the rubble and alleviate matters. But, selfishly, I would sure hate to no longer have a job to go to or as a small business owner in the community, have more things stacked on my plate during a worldwide pandemic. As for lives affected in the distant future, near the intersection of Lake Street and Minnehaha Avenue in Minneapolis, a construction site for an affordable housing project was torched. Not to be dismissed, there actually has been another life loss because of the unrest. Calvin L. Horton, 43, was fatally shot just outside of Cadillac Jewelry in Minneapolis by the pawn shop owner who suspected Horton was a looter. This is all why in a previous story, I said there is no strong excuse for rioting. However, that should not be mistaken for no excuse or defense at all. During an NFL preseason game nearly four years ago, Colin Kaepernick, then the quarterback of the San Francisco 49ers, remained seated during the playing of the national anthem as silent protest against forms of injustice against the black community. As the weeks progressed, Kaepernick adjusted his protest to kneeling. The NFL owners responded by keeping him out of the league for the last three years and counting. Some fans responded by choosing to boycott the NFL as television ratings for the games momentarily went down. President Donald Trump responded with the following statement in a rally in September 2017: “Wouldn’t you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, ‘Get that son of a bitch off the field right now. Out! He’s fired. He’s fired!” I have a hard time fully supporting rioting while seeing all the damage and destruction, but I also can’t say that I don’t understand it either. If silent and peaceful protests for injustice, which Floyd’s death serves as an example to this day, were met with that kind of resistance, it’s pretty easy to realize why rioting is the strategy today. If silently kneeling before a football game was too uncomfortable for some to drive the attention to the real issues, the next logical step is to make a good deal of noise to get people to listen. In more recent news, the leader of the free world took to Twitter on Thursday night. Calling the looters “THUGS’ and critical of local leadership in Minneapolis, particularly “very weak Radical Left” Mayor Jacob Frey, Trump implied that he would intervene if the city and rioting could not be brought under control, ending his tweets with “when the looting starts, the shooting starts.” Twitter, taking those words as an advocacy of violence, placed a disclaimer on the tweet. On Friday afternoon, Trump said his tweet was misunderstood, stating “as a fact” that looting could lead to more shooting. Additionally, Trump referenced the seven people who were shot in Louisville, Ky., on Thursday night during protests for Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old black person who was shot and killed in her apartment by police in March. Surely, Trump supporters will take a side while anti-Trumpers will be on the other side. Like gasoline on a flame, division in a long-divided country will only widen. And that’s disappointing, because when it comes to this issue, the death of George Floyd should take a backseat. In the span of four days, our main focus is not as clear as it should, but given how past situations have gone, we all should have seen this coming. When it comes to injustices to the black community, it’s hard not to think that some people simply don’t care.

WAVE 3 News reporter Kaitlin Rust appeared to have been hit by pepper balls, reportedly fired by a police officer, during a Friday night protest in downtown Louisville, Kentucky. (Source: WAVE/Gray News) It was previously reported that the officer was firing rubber bullets, but LMPD spokeswoman Jessie Halladay said the department’s officers do not use rubber bullets, and it was likely that was Rust and Dobson were hit with pepper balls. Halladay commented again on the incident during a Saturday morning briefing with Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer. “We believe it was one of our SRT officers; we are still trying to identify which officer,” Halladay said. “Targeting the media is not our intention. There was a lot going on last night, and to be fair to both the officer and to Kaitlin, we need to take a deeper look at what happened and what prompted that action. So we have said that we will do that and if there needs to be discipline we will address it.” In response to what happened to Rust and Dobson, WAVE 3 News General Manager Ken Selvaggi issued a statement saying, “We strongly condemn the actions of the LMPD officer who tonight repeatedly fired at and hit our reporter and cameraman, both of whom were courageously and lawfully covering breaking news in their community. There is simply no justification for the Louisville police to wantonly open fire, even with pepper balls, on any journalists under any circumstances.” The statement also said “When the officer fired at Ms. Rust and Mr. Dobson, the two had been following police instructions, were standing behind the police line when they were fired upon, and were not disrupting or otherwise interfering with law enforcement.” During night two of several hundred protesters gathering downtown in wake of protests across the country following the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, crowds appear to be larger and police are continuing their efforts to clear the area. A WAVE vehicle was found vandalized downtown as the crowd intensified. Louisville protesters want action taken against three LMPD officers involved in the death of 26-year-old Breonna Taylor, a black woman, in March. She was shot during a no-knock warrant that was being served at her home. Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer announced Friday morning no-knock warrants would be suspended in the city. “To people who gathered downtown last night to protest,” Fischer said, “and to many more throughout our city and throughout our country who feel angry, hurt, afraid, frustrated, tired and sick of story after story of black lives ending at the hands of law-enforcement, I hear you.” He also spoke of unity and thanked Taylor’s family for speaking out against the Thursday night protests that resulted in seven people being hit by gunfire and vandalism. “This is the challenge of our time that we must rise to,” Fischer said. “So let’s rise to the challenge of this moment and work for the truth, work for peace, work for justice for Breonna Taylor, her family and for all of the people of our city. They deserve it. We deserve it.” Copyright 2020 WAVE via Gray News. All rights reserved.",0.0
1620695421,2020-05-30 02:15:49,Pentagon puts military police on alert to go to Minneapolis,https://www.valleynewslive.com/content/news/Pentagon-puts-military-police-on-alert-to-go-to-Minneapolis-570888721.html,en,True,,86247,valleynewslive.com,http://www.valleynewslive.com/#spider,"The Pentagon said Saturday it was ready to provide military help to authorities scrambling to contain unrest in Minneapolis, where George Floyd’s death has sparked widespread protests, but Gov. Tim Walz has not requested federal troops. People set a fire during continued protest Friday, May 29, 2020, in Minneapolis. Protests continued following the death of George Floyd, who died after being restrained by Minneapolis police officers on Memorial Day. Jonathan Rath Hoffman, the chief Pentagon spokesman, said several military units have been placed on higher alert ""as a prudent planning measure"" in case Walz asks for help. The Associated Press first reported on the potential deployments and, citing sources with direct knowledge of the orders, named four locations from which soldiers would be drawn. Hoffman did not identify the units, but other officials said they are mainly military police. Hoffman said these are units normally on 48-hour recall to support state authorities in the event of crises like natural disasters. They are now on four-hour alert, Hoffman said. Defense officials said there was no intent by the Pentagon to deploy any federal forces to Minnesota unless Walz asked for help. If he did make such a request, federal units such as military police could provide logistical and other kinds of support to the Minnesota National Guard or state law enforcement, but would not get directly involved in law enforcement under current plans, the officials said. They were not authorized to discuss the planning publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. Hoffman said Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, had spoken to Walz twice in the past 24 hours and told him the Pentagon was prepared to help if needed. Maj. Gen. Jon Jensen, the adjutant general of the Minnesota National Guard, said the Pentagon's decision to place some military units on a higher state of alert for potential deployment was ""a prudent move"" that gave Walz more options. Earlier, Alyssa Farah, the White House director of strategic communications, told the AP that the deployment of active-duty military police to Minnesota was untrue. In an email, she referred to Title 10, the U.S. law that governs the armed forces and would authorize active duty military to operate within the country ""False: off the record - title 10 not under discussion,"" said Farah. No off-record agreement was negotiated with the AP. President Donald Trump urged Walz and other authorities in Minnesota to ""be tough"" in Minneapolis. ""We have our military ready, willing and able if they ever want to call our military, and we can have troops on the ground every quickly,"" Trump said. Soldiers from Fort Bragg in North Carolina and Fort Drum in New York have been ordered to be ready to deploy within four hours if called, according to three people with direct knowledge of the orders. Soldiers in Fort Carson, in Colorado, and Fort Riley in Kansas have been told to be ready within 24 hours. The people were not were not authorized to discuss the preparations publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. The get-ready orders were sent verbally on Friday, after Trump asked Esper for military options to help quell the unrest in Minneapolis after protests descended into looting and arson in some parts of the city. Trump made the request on a phone call from the Oval Office on Thursday night that included Esper, national security advisor Robert O' Brien and several others. The president asked Esper for rapid deployment options if the Minneapolis protests continued to spiral out of control, according to one of the people, a senior Pentagon official who was on the call. The person said the military units would be deployed under the Insurrection Act of 1807, which was last used in 1992 during the riots in Los Angeles that followed the Rodney King trial. Another official said Saturday, however, that federal troops could be deployed to Minnesota without invoking that act. In that situation, they would perform non-law enforcement duties such as providing logistics help. ""If this is where the president is headed response-wise, it would represent a significant escalation and a determination that the various state and local authorities are not up to the task of responding to the growing unrest,"" said Brad Moss, a Washington D.C.-based attorney, who specializes in national security. Members of the police units were on a 30-minute recall alert early Saturday, meaning they would have to return to their bases inside that time limit in preparation for deployment to Minneapolis inside of four hours. Units at Fort Drum are set to head to Minneapolis first, according to the three people, including two Defense Department officials. Roughly 800 U.S. soldiers would deploy to the city if called. Protests erupted in Minneapolis this week after video emerged showing a police officer pressing his knee into Floyd's neck for several minutes even after Floyd stopping moving and pleading for air. Floyd later died of his injuries. The officer, Derek Chauvin, was arrested and charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter on Friday. The protests turned violent and on Thursday rioters torched the Minneapolis Third Police Precinct near where Floyd was arrested. Mayor Jacob Frey ordered a citywide curfew at 8 p.m. local time, beginning on Friday. In that city, peaceful protests picked up steam as darkness fell, with thousands of people ignoring the curfew to walk streets in the southern part of the city. Some cars were set on fire in scattered neighborhoods, business break-ins began and eventually there were larger fires. Active-duty forces are normally prohibited from acting as a domestic law enforcement agency. But the Insurrection Act offers an exception. There was no indication Saturday that Trump intended to invoke that act. It would allow the military to take up a policing authority it otherwise would not be allowed to do, enforcing state and federal laws, said Stephen Vladeck, a University of Texas School of Law professor who specializes in constitutional and national security law. The statute ""is deliberately vague"" when it comes to the instances in which the Insurrection Act could be used, he said. The state's governor could ask Trump to take action or Trump could act on his own authority if he's determined that the local authorities are so overwhelmed that they can't adequately enforce the law, Vladeck said. ""It is a very, very broad grant of authority for the president,"" he added. —— LaPorta reported from Delray Beach, Florida. Associated Press reporters writers Lita. C.

1620709059,2020-05-30 02:13:38,George Floyd protests: National Guard mobilized in Atlanta; fatal shooting in Detroit,https://www.valleynewslive.com/content/news/Protests-over-George-Floyds-death-spread-across-the-nation-570877771.html,en,True,,86247,valleynewslive.com,http://www.valleynewslive.com/#spider,"Demonstrators marched, stopped traffic and in some cases lashed out violently at police as protests erupted Friday in dozens of U.S. cities following the killing of George Floyd after a white officer pressed a knee into his neck while taking him into custody in Minnesota. Protestors demonstrate on University Avenue while holding a ""WE CAN'T BREATHE"" sign and wearing protective masks, Thursday, May 28, 2020, in St. Paul, Minn. Protests over the death of George Floyd, a black man who died in police custody Monday, broke out in Minneapolis for a third straight night. (AP Photo/John Minchillo) Georgia's governor declared a state of emergency in one county to activate up to 500 members of the state National Guard ""to protect people & property in Atlanta."" Gov. Brian Kemp said in a pair of tweets early Saturday that the move came at the request of Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms and in consultation with emergency officials. The Georgia National Guard will deploy ""immediately"" to assist law enforcement, he said. In Minneapolis, where a police precinct was burned the night before, peaceful protests picked up steam as darkness fell, with thousands of people ignoring an 8 p.m. curfew to walk streets in the southern part of the city. Some cars were set on fire in scattered neighborhoods, business break-ins began and eventually there were larger fires. As a pair of restaurants and a Wells Fargo branch were set ablaze, a heavy contingent of National Guard, state troopers and police moved in, some on foot and some in vehicles. In Phoenix, Denver, Las Vegas, Los Angeles and beyond, thousands of protesters carried signs that said: ""He said I can't breathe. Justice for George."" They chanted """"No justice, no peace"" and ""Say his name. George Floyd."" One person was killed in downtown Detroit after someone in an SUV fired shots into a crowd of protesters, a Detroit police spokeswoman said Saturday. The shooting occurred about 11:30 p.m. Friday near Detroit’s Greektown entertainment district as officers were confronted with dozens of protesters, said Sgt. Nicole Kirkwood, a police department spokeswoman. She said an officer wasn’t involved in the shooting. Kirkwood said the victim was a 19-year-old man, who was pronounced dead at the hospital. After hours of peaceful protest in downtown Atlanta, some demonstrators suddenly turned violent, smashing police cars, setting one on fire, spray-painting the iconic logo sign at CNN headquarters, and breaking into a restaurant. The crowd pelted officers with bottles, chanting ""Quit your jobs."" At least three officers were hurt and there were multiple arrests, Atlanta police spokesman Carlos Campos said. Campos said protesters shot BB guns at officers and threw bricks, bottles and knives at them. People watched the scene from rooftops, some laughing as skirmishes broke out. Bottoms passionately addressed the protesters at a news conference: ""This is not a protest. This is not in the spirit of Martin Luther King Jr."" ""You are disgracing our city,"" she told protesters. ""You are disgracing the life of George Floyd and every other person who has been killed in this country. We are better than this. We are better than this as a city. We are better than this as a country. Go home, go home."" Bottoms was flanked by rappers T.I. and Killer Mike, as well as King's daughter, Bernice King. Killer Mike cried as he spoke. ""We have to be better than this moment. We have to be better than burning down our own homes. Because if we lose Atlanta what have we got?"" he said. After Mayor Bottoms appealed for calm, the violence continued. More cars were set on fire, a Starbucks was smashed up, the windows of the College Football Hall of Fame were broken, and the iconic Omni Hotel was vandalized. Protesters gathered outside the White House, with President Donald Trump inside, and some tried to push through barriers set up by the U.S. Secret Service along Pennsylvania Avenue. An initially peaceful demonstration in New York City spiraled into chaos as night fell, as protesters skirmished with officers, destroyed police vehicles and set fires. In Brooklyn, activists who had marched from Manhattan chanted insults at officers lined up outside the Barclays Center and pelted them with water bottles. Police sprayed an eye-irritating chemical into the largely diverse crowd multiple times, then cleared the plaza. Video posted to social media showed officers using batons and shoving protesters down as they took people into custody and cleared streets. Demonstrators rocked a police van, set it ablaze, then scrawled graffiti across its charred hulk and set it on fire a second time as officers retreated from the area. Blocks away, protesters used a club to batter another police vehicle. Numerous people were arrested and police brought in buses to carry off those they arrested. ""We have a long night ahead of us in Brooklyn,"" Mayor Bill de Blasio tweeted. ""Our sole focus is deescalating this situation and getting people home safe. There will be a full review of what happened tonight. We don't ever want to see another night like this."" The police department said numerous officers were injured, including one who had a tooth knocked out. The names of black people killed by police, including Floyd and Eric Garner, who died on Staten Island in 2014, were on signs carried by those in the crowd, and in their chants. ""It's my duty to be out here,"" said Brianna Petrisko, among those at Foley Square in lower Manhattan, where most were wearing masks amid the coronavirus pandemic. ""Our country has a sickness. We have to be out here. This is the only way we're going to be heard."" In Houston, where George Floyd grew up, several thousand people rallied in front of City Hall. Among them was 19-year-old Jimmy Ohaz, who came from the nearby city of Richmond, Texas. ""My question is how many more, how many more? I just want to live in a future where we all live in harmony and we're not oppressed."" Tensions rose in several West Coast cities as night fell and protesters blocked highways in Los Angeles and Oakland. About 1,000 protesters gathered in Oakland. They smashed windows, sprayed buildings with ""Kill Cops"" graffiti and were met with chemical spray from police. Oakland Police were notifying a crowd that the demonstrationwas an unlawful assembly. Authorities said officers were injured when projectiles were thrown and that they were asking people to leave the area. Demonstrators in Los Angeles scuffled at times with police, with a few protesters detained and one officer receiving medical treatment, police said. An LAPD vehicle had its windows smashed, and CNN reported that someone wrote ""killer"" on a patrol car. Protesters repeatedly clashed with police in the Silicon Valley city of San Jose, said Mayor Sam Liccardo, and police responded with flash-bang grenades and rubber bullets. One officer was being treated at a hospital for an injury that was not life-threatening, he and police officials said. Liccardo said his own officers shared the community's outrage over Floyd's in-custody death. ""It was a horrible injustice. I'd venture to guess that every police officer out there feels much of the same anger about what happened in Minneapolis,"" he told The Associated Press. Thirty miles to the west, Santa Cruz police chief Andrew G. Mills said in a statement that the actions by Minneapolis officers in Floyd’s death “are the antithesis of what we view as good policing.” Copyright 2020 Associated Press. All rights reserved.",0.0

Protests continued across the country overnight as outrage grows over the death of George Floyd. (Source: CNN) The protests, which began in Minneapolis following Floyd's death Monday after a police officer pressed a knee on his neck until he stopped breathing, have left parts of the city a grid of broken windows, burned-out buildings and ransacked stores. The unrest has since become a national phenomenon as protesters decry years of deaths at police hands. Tens of thousands of people were in the streets across the country, many of them not wearing masks or observing social distancing, raising concerns among health experts about the potential for spreading the coronavirus pandemic at a time when much of the country is in the process of reopening society and the economy. After a tumultuous Friday, racially diverse crowds held mostly peaceful demonstrations in dozens of cities, though many later descended into violence as had happened the previous night. Few corners of America were untouched, from protesters setting fires inside Reno's city hall, to police launching tear gas at rock-throwing demonstrators in Fargo, North Dakota, to shattered windows at police headquarters in Richmond, Virginia. — In Indianapolis, police were investigating ""multiple shootings"" downtown, including one that left a person dead, amid the protests. Police gave few details but said no officers were involved. — In Washington, the National Guard was deployed outside the White House, where chanting crowds taunted law enforcement officers. Dressed in camouflage and holding shields, the troops stood in a tight line a few yards from the crowd, preventing them from pushing forward. President Donald Trump, who spent much of Saturday in Florida for the SpaceX rocket launch, landed on the lawn in the presidential helicopter at dusk and went inside without speaking to journalists. — In Philadelphia, at least 13 officers were injured when peaceful protests turned violent and at least four police vehicles were set on fire. Other fires were set throughout downtown. — In Salt Lake City, protesters defied a curfew and National Guard troops were deployed by Utah's governor. Demonstrators flipped a police car and lit it on fire, and another vehicle was later set ablaze. Police said six people were arrested and a police officer was injured after being struck in the head with a baseball bat. — In Los Angeles, protesters chanted ""Black Lives Matter,"" some within inches of the face shields of officers. Police used batons to move the crowd back and fired rubber bullets. A graffiti-covered police car burned in the street. — And in New York City, dangerous confrontations flared repeatedly as officers made arrests and cleared streets. A video showed two NYPD cruisers lurching into a crowd of demonstrators who were pushing a barricade against one of them and pelting it with objects. Several people were knocked to the ground, and it was unclear if anyone was hurt. ""The mistakes that are happening are not mistakes. They're repeated violent terrorist offenses and people need to stop killing black people,"" Brooklyn protester Meryl Makielski said. Not all protests devolved into violence. In Juneau, Alaska, law enforcement officers joined elected officials and residents at a peaceful protest in front of a giant whale sculpture on the city's waterfront. ""We don't tolerate excessive use of force,"" Juneau Police Chief Ed Mercer told the gathering. Back in Minneapolis, the city where the protests began, police, state troopers and National Guard members moved in soon after an 8 p.m. curfew took effect to break up protests, firing tear gas and rubber bullets to clear streets outside a police precinct and elsewhere. The show of force came after three days when police largely avoided engaging protesters, and after the state poured in more than 4,000 National Guard troops to Minneapolis and said the number would soon rise to nearly 11,000. ""The situation in Minneapolis is no longer in any way about the murder of George Floyd,"" said Gov. Tim Walz, who also said local forces had been overmatched the previous day. ""It is about attacking civil society, instilling fear and disrupting our great cities."" Minneapolis' streets steadily grew calmer as the night went on, and Corrections Commissioner Paul Schnell said the tough response would remain as long as it takes to ""quell this situation."" Some residents were glad to see the upheaval dissipating. ""l live here. I haven't been able to sleep,"" said Iman Muhammad, whose neighborhood saw multiple fires set Friday night. Muhammad said she sympathized with peaceful protests over Floyd's death but disagreed with the violence: ""Wrong doesn't answer wrong."" Trump appeared to cheer on the tougher tactics Saturday night, commending the Guard deployment in Minneapolis, declaring ""No games!"" and saying police in New York City ""must be allowed to do their job!"" Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden condemned the violence as he continued to express common cause with those demonstrating after Floyd's death. ""The act of protesting should never be allowed to overshadow the reason we protest,"" Biden said in a statement Saturday night. Overnight curfews were imposed in more than a dozen major cities nationwide, including Atlanta, Denver, Los Angeles, Minneapolis and Seattle. More than 1,300 people have been arrested in 16 cities since Thursday, including over 500 Friday in Los Angeles. The unrest comes at a time when most Americans have spent months inside over concerns surrounding the coronavirus, which the president has called an ""invisible enemy."" The events of the last 72 hours, seen live on national television, have shown the opposite: a sudden pivot to crowds, screaming protesters and burning buildings, and a stark contrast to the empty streets of recent months. ""Quite frankly I'm ready to just lock people up,"" Atlanta Police Chief Erika Shields said at a news conference. Demonstrations there turned violent Friday, and police were arresting protesters Saturday on blocked-off downtown streets. ""Yes, you caught us off balance once. It's not going to happen twice."" This week's unrest recalled the riots in Los Angeles nearly 30 years ago after the acquittal of the white police officers who beat Rodney King, a black motorist who had led them on a high-speed chase. The protests of Floyd's killing have gripped many more cities, but the losses in Minneapolis have yet to approach the staggering totals Los Angeles saw during five days of rioting in 1992, when more than 60 people died, 2,000-plus were injured and thousands arrested, with property damage topping $1 billion. Many protesters spoke of frustration that Floyd's death was one more in a litany. It came in the wake of the killing in Georgia of Ahmaud Arbery, a black man who was shot dead after being pursued by two white men while running in their neighborhood, and in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic that has thrown millions out of work, killed more than 100,000 people in the U.S. and disproportionately affected black people. The officer who held his knee to Floyd's neck as he begged for air was arrested Friday and charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. But many protesters are demanding the arrests of the three other officers involved. Trump stoked the anger on Twitter, saying that if protesters had breached the White House fence, they would ""have been greeted with the most vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons, I have ever seen."" Leaders in many affected cities have voiced outrage over Floyd's killing and expressed sympathy for protesters' concerns. But as the unrest intensified, they spoke of a desperate need to protect their cities and said they would call in reinforcements, despite concerns that could lead to more heavy-handed tactics. Governors in Georgia, Kentucky, Ohio and Texas also activated the National Guard after protests there turned violent. Police in St. Louis were investigating the death of a protester who climbed between two trailers of a Fed Ex truck and was killed when it drove away. And a person was killed in the area of protests in downtown Detroit just before midnight after someone fired shots into an SUV, officers said. Police had initially said someone fired into the crowd from an SUV. ___ Numerous AP journalists contributed from across the U.S. Copyright 2020 Associated Press. All rights reserved.",0.0

Several fires were burning in the area, including a Wells Fargo bank branch kitty-corner from the police station, a U.S. post office and a commercial building. A heavy contingent of newly activated National Guard, state troopers and police were moving in around midnight, some on foot and some in vehicles while confronting a third straight night of nearly unchecked looting, vandalism and arson.

Tim Walz delivered a live address at 1:30 a.m. with Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington and Maj. Gen. Jon Jensen of the Minnesota National Guard. “Go home,” Walz urged protesters who had embraced violence while also admitting that public safety personnel were overwhelmed. “Quite candidly we do not have the numbers,” Walz said. To that end, the National Guard is activating another 1,000 soldiers to join the 500 who were called up Thursday. Walz said that would constitute the largest peacetime force ever assembled in Minnesota. The Pentagon also took the rare step Friday of ordering the Army to put several active-duty U.S. military police units on the ready to deploy to Minneapolis.

Some security personnel had been subjected to gunfire, though no one was injured. Harrington also said there was evidence of outside agitators arriving in Minneapolis to stoke unrest. Two miles to the east of the 5th Precinct, protesters on Thursday torched the 3rd Precinct police station soon after it was abandoned by police and vandalized dozens of businesses. Early Saturday, another large fire was burning in the vicinity of the 3rd Precinct, according to KSTP-TV’s helicopter coverage. Following the Friday afternoon announcement by law enforcement officials that fired Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, who is white, had been arrested and charged with murdering Floyd, who was black, thousands of protesters again gathered in front of the Hennepin County Government Center to demand justice. Demonstrators then marched through downtown and onto Interstate 35W, shutting down its southbound lanes. The freeway occupation was continuing early Saturday. Closer to the battered 3rd Precinct, which was left to burn Thursday night, officers fired tear gas and rubber bullets to drive back crowds of protesters. Earlier Friday, the neighborhood surrounding the 3rd Precinct cleaned up. National Guard members carrying assault rifles were lined up at some intersections ahead of an 8 p.m. curfew, keeping people away from the police station on East Lake Street. Dozens of volunteers swept up broken glass in the street. The precinct building, which was abandoned by its contingent of officers about 10 p.m. Thursday after protesters breached a hastily erected perimeter fence, was just one of many buildings set ablaze during the chaos overnight. Several businesses that survived the first round of rioting the night before were reduced to smoldering rubble by dawn. Community-led cleanup efforts were underway Friday in much of the city, including the heavily damaged area around Lake Street and Hiawatha Avenue as well as Uptown. Among the scores of casualties was Ghandi Mahal, an Indian restaurant located about a block away from the third precinct. In a post on the restaurant’s Facebook page, owner Ruhel Islam’s daughter, Hafsa, thanked “our ￼neighbors who did their best to stand guard and protect Gandhi Mahal.” “Don’t worry about us, we will rebuild and we will recover,” she wrote. She also quoted her father: “Let my building burn,” he said, according to the post. “Justice needs to be served, put those officers in jail.” A nearby U.S. post office on East 31st Street also burned overnight. The popular Hexagon Bar on 27th Avenue South was destroyed by fire, and the public library branch on East Lake Street was damaged. Dean Hanson, 64, lives in a subsidized housing unit nearby, which is home to many older residents. He said his building lost electricity overnight, and residents were terrified as they watched mobs of people loot and burn their way through the neighborhood. “I can’t believe this is happening here,” he said. “It was pure hell.”  ",0.0

Floyd, a black man, died in the custody of Minneapolis police after a white officer, Derek Chauvin, knelt on his neck for several minutes on Monday, May 25. Floyd's death has sparked massive protests in Minneapolis and other cities across the country. Chauvin has been arrested and charged with murder and manslaughter. The Fargo protest, which has so far remained peaceful, began at 10 a.m. at Island Park before it continued through the downtown streets, moving west 20 blocks to police headquarters at 25th Street and First Avenue North, and then south on 25th Street. At about 1 p.m., the Fargo Police Department posted on its social media pages, asking people to avoid 13th Avenue South and 25th Street South because ""the area is becoming impassable."" Police later said the marchers were moving west toward West Acres mall but the group appeared to get smaller as time went on.

PAUL — In response to several nights of destructive riots in Minneapolis sparked by the death of local 46-year-old George Floyd in police custody, Gov. Tim Walz on Saturday morning, May 30 announced the ""full mobilization"" of the Minnesota National Guard. It will be the first time that the National Guard has been marshaled in the state at that scale, he said, amid what has already been called the largest domestic deployment of the Guard in Minnesota in its 164-year history. While acknowledging the trauma that Floyd's death has inflicted on Minneapolis's black communities and communities of color, Walz condemned this week's rioting in strong terms. ""The situation in Minneapolis is no longer in any way about the murder of George Floyd,"" he said during a Saturday press conference. Walz and other local officials said that violent groups and individuals active in the Twin Cities area in recent days are believed to come from outside of the state and region. Criminal groups may be behind some of the looting and fire-setting that have ravaged the metro. Mayor Melvin Carter of St. Paul said individual arrested by city police Friday night came from outside of the state, for example. Minnesota Department of Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington said his agency has seen social media posts from white supremacist groups that said they planned to travel here and agitate the situation as well. listen live watch live Harrington said that additional information on the background of groups believed to be inciting violence in the cities would be released sometime Saturday. Arrest figures were not immediately available. Peaceful protest over Floyd's death planned for Saturday, Walz said, will still be allowed to take place but additional Guard soldiers and airmen will be deployed to the Twin Cities are to reinforce local law enforcement agencies based here. Up to 2,500 Guard service members will be in the area by noon, according to Maj. Gen. Jon Jensen, adjutant general of the Minnesota National Guard. ""We're all in,"" Jensen said stoically. Mayor Jacob Frey of Minneapolis warned that protesters out after the ongoing 8 p.m. curfew put in place Friday may passively provide cover for violent actors, making it difficult for authorities to suss them out. ""We'll need everybody complying,"" he said. Derek Chauvin, the now-former Minneapolis police officer who was taped kneeling on Floyd's neck in the moments leading up to his death, was arrested a day earlier and charged with murder in the third degree as well as manslaughter. But his arrest and the Friday night curfews put in place to tamp down on the chaos seemed to have failed to quell the rage that surges through the area. And while many neighborhoods rallied to clean up businesses smashed in the frenzy, many more were set ablaze Friday evening, according to police radio reports. The protests and riots come at a time when Minnesota and the U.S. are still reeling from the coronavirus pandemic. Many demonstrators are wearing masks and face covering but social distancing has gone by the wayside in a move that could further exacerbate the spread of COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by coronavirus.",0.0

Some cars were set on fire in scattered neighborhoods, business break-ins began and eventually there were larger fires as lawless protesters outflanked authorities and converged on the 5th Precinct police station at 31st Street and Nicollet Avenue. Several fires were burning in the area, including a Wells Fargo bank branch kitty-corner from the police station, a U.S. post office and a commercial building. A heavy contingent of newly activated National Guard, state troopers and police were moving in around midnight, some on foot and some in vehicles while confronting a third straight night of nearly unchecked looting, vandalism and arson. The Minnesota Department of Public Safety said on Twitter than 350 personnel were in the area and arresting people who refused to disperse. listen live watch live Gov. Tim Walz delivered a live address at 1:30 a.m. with Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington and Maj. Gen. Jon Jensen of the Minnesota National Guard. “Go home,” Walz urged protesters who had embraced violence while also admitting that public safety personnel were overwhelmed. “Quite candidly we do not have the numbers,” Walz said. To that end, the National Guard is activating another 1,000 soldiers to join the 500 who were called up Thursday. Walz said that would constitute the largest peacetime force ever assembled in Minnesota. The Pentagon also took the rare step Friday of ordering the Army to put several active-duty U.S. military police units on the ready to deploy to Minneapolis. Jensen, the adjutant general of the Minnesota National Guard, said that option remained on the table. Harrington said the troublemakers, whom he termed “entrenched rioters,” had grown more dangerous. Some security personnel had been subjected to gunfire, though no one was injured. Harrington also said there was evidence of outside agitators arriving in Minneapolis to stoke unrest. Two miles to the east of the 5th Precinct, protesters on Thursday torched the 3rd Precinct police station soon after it was abandoned by police and vandalized dozens of businesses. Early Saturday, another large fire was burning in the vicinity of the 3rd Precinct, according to KSTP-TV’s helicopter coverage. Following the Friday afternoon announcement by law enforcement officials that fired Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, who is white, had been arrested and charged with murdering Floyd, who was black, thousands of protesters again gathered in front of the Hennepin County Government Center to demand justice. Demonstrators then marched through downtown and onto Interstate 35W, shutting down its southbound lanes. The freeway occupation was continuing early Saturday. Closer to the battered 3rd Precinct, which was left to burn Thursday night, officers fired tear gas and rubber bullets to drive back crowds of protesters. Earlier Friday, the neighborhood surrounding the 3rd Precinct cleaned up. National Guard members carrying assault rifles were lined up at some intersections ahead of an 8 p.m. curfew, keeping people away from the police station on East Lake Street.

PAUL — In response to several nights of destructive riots in Minneapolis sparked by the death of local 46-year-old George Floyd in police custody, Gov. Tim Walz on Saturday morning, May 30 announced the ""full mobilization"" of the Minnesota National Guard.

While acknowledging the trauma that Floyd's death has inflicted on Minneapolis's black communities and communities of color, Walz condemned this week's rioting in strong terms.

PAUL — In response to several nights of destructive riots in Minneapolis sparked by the death of local 46-year-old George Floyd in police custody, Gov. Tim Walz on Saturday morning, May 30 announced the ""full mobilization"" of the Minnesota National Guard. It will be the first time that the National Guard has been marshaled in the state at that scale, he said, amid what has already been called the largest domestic deployment of the Guard in Minnesota in its 164-year history. While acknowledging the trauma that Floyd's death has inflicted on Minneapolis's black communities and communities of color, Walz condemned this week's rioting in strong terms. ""The situation in Minneapolis is no longer in any way about the murder of George Floyd,"" he said during a Saturday press conference. Walz and other local officials said that violent groups and individuals active in the Twin Cities area in recent days are believed to come from outside of the state and region. Criminal groups may be behind some of the looting and fire-setting that have ravaged the metro. Mayor Melvin Carter of St. Paul said individual arrested by city police Friday night came from outside of the state, for example. Minnesota Department of Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington said his agency has seen social media posts from white supremacist groups that said they planned to travel here and agitate the situation as well. Harrington said that additional information on the background of groups believed to be inciting violence in the cities would be released sometime Saturday. Arrest figures were not immediately available. Peaceful protest over Floyd's death planned for Saturday, Walz said, will still be allowed to take place but additional Guard soldiers and airmen will be deployed to the Twin Cities are to reinforce local law enforcement agencies based here. Up to 2,500 Guard service members will be in the area by noon, according to Maj. Gen. Jon Jensen, adjutant general of the Minnesota National Guard. ""We're all in,"" Jensen said stoically. Mayor Jacob Frey of Minneapolis warned that protesters out after the ongoing 8 p.m. curfew put in place Friday may passively provide cover for violent actors, making it difficult for authorities to suss them out. ""We'll need everybody complying,"" he said. Derek Chauvin, the now-former Minneapolis police officer who was taped kneeling on Floyd's neck in the moments leading up to his death, was arrested a day earlier and charged with murder in the third degree as well as manslaughter. But his arrest and the Friday night curfews put in place to tamp down on the chaos seemed to have failed to quell the rage that surges through the area. And while many neighborhoods rallied to clean up businesses smashed in the frenzy, many more were set ablaze Friday evening, according to police radio reports. The protests and riots come at a time when Minnesota and the U.S. are still reeling from the coronavirus pandemic. Many demonstrators are wearing masks and face covering but social distancing has gone by the wayside in a move that could further exacerbate the spread of COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by coronavirus.",0.0

PAUL — In the early hours of Sunday, May 31, officials said Minnesota law enforcement have gotten a hold on the Twin Cities' days-long string of riots, stealing and arson fires. Minnesota Department of Corrections Commissioner Paul Schnell told reporters at 1 a.m. Sunday that residents can ""rest a little easier"" after officials substantially beefed up police and National Guard presence and operations Saturday. The increased policing came following four days of protesting 46-year-old George Floyd's death in police custody on Monday night. While some protests remained peaceful, many sparked confrontations between demonstrators and police. Incidents of violence, looting and arson began cropping up around the metro, some of which officials pin on potential outside criminal groups intent on causing more mayhem. Early Sunday, Schnell said public safety officials do not see themselves as ""out of the woods"" yet, but things were better off in the hours prior to a 1 a.m. press conference than earlier this week. Most of the groups that officers intercepted were smaller than in previous nights, he said -- between five and 20 people each.

He also gave credit to Saturday night's relative return to normalcy to residents' ""incredible levels of compliance"" with Saturday night's 8 p.m. curfew, as well as a commitment to protecting their neighborhoods. Whether to extend the curfew beyond Saturday night is left to Gov. Tim Walz and local officials, he said. ""Do I think we’ve made progress tonight? Yes. Do I think we will have a better sense as we get into this tomorrow? Yes,"" Schnell said. ""Ultimately, the goal is to restore the situation to a point where regular, normal police operations are adequate."" Hours earlier, Walz told reporters that Minneapolis and St. Paul were in for a ""long night,"" and was followed by other state officials who projected a sense of early optimism over their grasp on the situation.

Schnell and other officials stressed, however, that the night was still young. ""Some of the groups that are here are in it for the long haul,"" he said. Prior to nightfall, demonstrators struck a mostly peaceful tone on Saturday.

Floyd, who was black, died Monday evening following a confrontation with police officers responding to a counterfeiting incident reported by a south Minneapolis convenience store. Officers located him inside a vehicle matching one described in the initial call to police. Derek Chauvin, 44, the white officer who a bystander captured on video kneeling on a handcuffed Floyd's neck shortly before he died, was fired this week, arrested and charged with murder in the third degree and manslaughter. Walz and others have decried the act as a murder, and a protest that started in Minneapolis briefly boiled over in neighboring St. Paul this week before spreading to other U.S. cities. Amid the calls for justice reform, however, are widespread reports of destructive behavior. But many communities have rebounded to clean up battered storefronts and buildings under the light of day. Government officials at the state and local level, including Walz and the mayors of Minneapolis and St. Paul, have said repeatedly now they have reason to believe that groups from outside the region and with ties to organized crime may be responsible for looting and riots that were carried out amid protests over Floyd's death in recent days. State and city officials have been evasive, however, about the source and validity of the intelligence that suggested outside groups are infiltrating demonstrations. Walz said that he still believed the intelligence to be credible but left open the possibility that information collected during arrests made tonight may ultimately suggest otherwise.

PAUL — In the early hours of Sunday, May 31, officials said Minnesota law enforcement have gotten a hold on the Twin Cities' days-long string of riots, stealing and arson fires. Minnesota Department of Corrections Commissioner Paul Schnell told reporters at 1 a.m. Sunday that residents can ""rest a little easier"" after officials substantially beefed up police and National Guard presence and operations Saturday. The increased policing came following four days of protesting 46-year-old George Floyd's death in police custody on Monday night. While some protests remained peaceful, many sparked confrontations between demonstrators and police. Incidents of violence, looting and arson began cropping up around the metro, some of which officials pin on potential outside criminal groups intent on causing more mayhem. Early Sunday, Schnell said public safety officials do not see themselves as ""out of the woods"" yet, but things were better off in the hours prior to a 1 a.m. press conference than earlier this week. Most of the groups that officers intercepted were smaller than in previous nights, he said -- between five and 20 people each. He also said earlier Saturday that officers successfully scattered a group congregating near the Minneapolis Police Department's 5th Precinct. Officials did not immediately have available updated arrest numbers. Schnell said the number was ""in the dozens,"" but added that the booking process has taken longer than usual. listen live watch live Many of the arrests as of late Saturday were for curfew violations, though a tweet from the state Department of Public Safety said that it arrested several individuals for gun violations. Schnell said he was not positive of the exact number of additional officers out patrolling the Twin Cities Saturday night, but said the number was ""in the hundreds."" He also gave credit to Saturday night's relative return to normalcy to residents' ""incredible levels of compliance"" with Saturday night's 8 p.m. curfew, as well as a commitment to protecting their neighborhoods. Whether to extend the curfew beyond Saturday night is left to Gov. Tim Walz and local officials, he said. ""Do I think we’ve made progress tonight? Yes. Do I think we will have a better sense as we get into this tomorrow? Yes,"" Schnell said. ""Ultimately, the goal is to restore the situation to a point where regular, normal police operations are adequate."" Hours earlier, Walz told reporters that Minneapolis and St. Paul were in for a ""long night,"" and was followed by other state officials who projected a sense of early optimism over their grasp on the situation. Local, county and state public safety agencies reported fires and arrests in different parts of the cities throughout the night, but Maj. Gen.

Floyd, a black man, died in the custody of Minneapolis police after a white officer, Derek Chauvin, knelt on his neck for several minutes on Monday, May 25. Floyd's death has sparked massive protests in Minneapolis and other cities across the country. Chauvin has been arrested and charged with murder and manslaughter. The Fargo protest, which has so far remained peaceful, began at 10 a.m. at Island Park before it continued through the downtown streets, moving west 20 blocks to police headquarters at 25th Street and First Avenue North, and then south on 25th Street.

Police later said the marchers were moving west toward West Acres mall but the group appeared to get smaller as time went on.

Lest we forget - The Herald,https://www.herald.co.zw/inside-the-rhodesian-keep-lest-we-forget-2/,en,False,,658830,State News - United States - North Dakota,http://www.northdakota.statenews.net/,"Protective villages were meant to kill the spirit of resolve among freedom fighters and the peasants Isdore Guvamombe Saturday Lounge The liberation struggle had reached a decisive phase and the skies had not been very generous. The year was 1977, and the war had spread throughout Rhodesia. One wintry morning an operation started to round off villagers and close them in protective fences called “keeps”. Shinje Business Centre, the local administrative centre for Guruve, was fenced with pig wire and guarded 24 hours by armed auxiliary forces, called Makofi by villagers because of their brown uniform. Villagers were allocated small stands where they built small mud-and-pole huts. It was a tale from the village to squalor. There was a head count of villagers in the mornings and evenings, like cattle. The Rhodesians wanted to stop villagers from feeding, clothing and associating with freedom fighters. They wanted to stop them from aiding the liberation movement. Each time villagers came into the keep, Rhodesian forces devised new search methods to ensure no one carried food and clothes for the freedom fighters. They also searched for guns, bullets and grenades. One soldier could search both male and female villagers. Sex and sexuality were no longer issues. This other morning, the gate was about to be closed for those going out and a woman known as Chihera was among the last. She was just seconds from closing time. Other villagers waited for her outside the gate, for, it was better to travel in groups during the war, especially to distant villages. There she was, typical of the Chihera women known by many, running to the gate, a wrapping cloth around her waist. Unbeknown to her, this day the soldiers had put a huge log and were ordering everyone to jump over it as part of the search. The instruction was to jump with your hands high up. If you had anything, it dropped. The soldiers did not allow head cloth or strong shoes in case one would donate to the freedom fighters. Chihera jumped and lo and behold, the wrap around cloth dropped. She had nothing like an undergarment. No petticoat, even. There were no tights then. There was silence, then laughter. There she stood, not even trying to pick up the cloth. “Woman pick up your cloth! You are under arrest, you wanted to go and sleep with the guerrillas?” shouted the soldier. “Listen, I am the age of your mother. You don’t use that language on me. I did not complete my dressing because I was late and wanted to beat your gate closing time. I . . .” The soldier could not partake. He shouted back. Another soldier dragged Chihera who kicked, punched and shouted as they dragged her to the base. She still refused to dress up. If the soldier pulled up the cloth, she pulled it down. The drama continued for a while attracting the old and the young alike. Boys stopped playing home-made plastic ball and joined in. Everyone gathered by the base and Chihera continued to protest until they changed their tactic and started pleading with her to dress up. Eventually she did. Since that day, they stopped searching women. What promoted the keep system was that Zanla combatants had continued to operate from Mozambique and remained dominant among people in eastern and central Rhodesia. It was fast spreading to the western parts of the country. No longer were the guerrillas the disorganised force they had been deemed in the late 1960s and were now more sophisticated, which took the Rhodesians by surprise. Despite escalating brutality, the Rhodesians were losing the war. Village boys marvelled at knowing the type of guns carried by Cdes Mcduff Mandebvu, Farai Kapfupi, Mabhunu Muchapera, Rovai Hondo, Disaster Bazooka, Menemene Disaster and others. The Rhodesian soldiers were especially afraid of going close to Dande River. Its riverine vegetation provided much shelter for freedom fighters. Dande River was a silent observer of the war. It never told the secrets. On its banks, riverine vegetation had witnessed budding romances blossom into weddings, women gossip and people, including liberation war fighters’ bath in the nude or half dressed. It had listened to many quarrels between washing and bathing women, good and bad gossip. Scandals too! The war, the war and the war. Yes, the war! Except for a few ripples caused by a falling tree leaf or flirting dragon fly or diving frog, the river flowed quietly. The boys, our boys, or “Vanamukoma” were winning, gaining confidence and becoming visible. Intermittently, there was the presence of the masters of disguise, the evil Selous Scouts, where it was uncommon to find a white man painted black only to be sold out by the lips. White soldiers also wore black ski masks. So many people were beaten silly or killed after failing to differentiate between the scouts and genuine freedom fighters. Livestock were also being affected severely by the drought and the war. Cattle and goats were so thin and hungry that they could be seen nibbling at anything that had a semblance of green, including papers. That year, Dande River was at its lowest, but not dry. Villagers saw, for the first time, the gleaming stones, polished smooth by ages of running water. Footpaths from various homesteads converged on the riverbanks, like the arms of an octopus. The river continued to flow lowly, oblivious of the passage of time or change of visitors. One morning, the camp was infiltrated by liberation war fighters and the soldiers found themselves overwhelmed. A gun battle ensued and many lives were lost. Some soldiers tried to seek refugee among the villagers who manhandled them and handed them over. For moments, the liberation fighters had taken over the keep. Hours later, helicopters hovered over Shinje and jam-packed lorries moved in with soldiers. But the “boys” as the freedom fighters were known, had retreated, having killed 23 soldiers. Chihera was arrested and that was the last she was seen. Today, 40 years after independence, no one knows where Chihera went. Many stories abound. Many theories abound too, But she played her part and was accused of planning the invasion.",0.0

The demonstration began with speakers and music near the Paul Bunyan and Babe the Blue Ox statues. BSU professor David Frison was one of a dozen speakers. ""The virus of racism is passed down from mother to daughter, from father to son,"" Frison said. ""When liberty is denied to all citizens, we can't breathe, America."" As “Where Is the Love?” by the Black Eyed Peas and other peace-promoting and anti-discrimination songs played over speakers, demonstrators chanted Floyd’s name, Black Lives Matter and more. Some stood with signs along Paul Bunyan Drive and cars honked as they passed by. Organizers of the protest estimated that 300 people attended the first hour in Paul Bunyan Park, and that possibly 500 people overall attended the demonstration. Masks were also handed out by organizers to attendees who didn’t have one to help prevent the spread of the coronavirus. The officer who knelt on Floyd's neck, Derek Chauvin, was arrested on Friday, May 29, and charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter after days of protesting and riots in Minneapolis and other areas in the Twin Cities. Floyd, 46, was shown in a viral video where Chauvin knelt on his neck for almost nine minutes on Monday, May 25. Three other officers involved in the case -- Thomas Lane, Tou Thao and J Alexander Kueng -- also were fired on Tuesday, May 26, from the Minneapolis Police Department. Hennepin County Medical Examiners released an updated autopsy report , which echoed an independent report, where doctors labeled Floyd's death a homicide. They reported he died due to ""cardiopulmonary arrest while being restrained by law enforcement officer(s)."" The march in Bemidji remained mostly peaceful until a handful of protesters surrounded and began throwing items at a D.A.R.E. truck as it backed away outside the police department. The truck backed into a small crowd of people and struck an event volunteer, who didn’t need medical attention and was “sore but okay,” according to a Facebook post by Our Revolution Bemidji, a group that organized the protest. After the confrontation organizers of the demonstration and police officers shook hands. Another peaceful demonstration is planned for 2 p.m. on Saturday, June 6, at Paul Bunyan Park. Bemidji State’s Black Student Union is hosting the Social Injustice Demonstration, where attendees, if they are able, will be silent for nine minutes while kneeling in memory of Floyd. City of Bemidji enacts curfew Late Saturday, Bemidji Mayor Rita Albrecht signed a declaration to enact a curfew for the city starting at 8 p.m. through 6 a.m. Sunday, May 31, and again at 8 p.m. Sunday through 6 a.m. Monday, June 1. During the curfew, no travel was allowed on any public street, sidewalk, path or any public place. “We will have and will continue to support the peaceful protest of our community. I ask for the community’s cooperation and support in following the curfew,” said Albrecht in a release. “Plan to stay safely at home tonight with your families and loved ones.” All law enforcement, fire and medical personnel, as well as other personnel authorized by the city of Bemidji Minnesota Department of Public Safety, Minnesota State Patrol or Minnesota National Guard, were exempt from the curfew, the release said.

Protesters faceoff with police in downtown Fargo FARGO — Roughly 2,000 demonstrators are still marching through the streets of Fargo and more recently West Fargo Saturday, May 30, in protest of the death of George Floyd. Floyd, a black man, died in the custody of Minneapolis police after a white officer, Derek Chauvin, knelt on his neck for several minutes on Monday, May 25. Floyd's death has sparked massive protests in Minneapolis and other cities across the country. Chauvin has been arrested and charged with murder and manslaughter. The Fargo protest, which has so far remained peaceful, began at 10 a.m. at Island Park before it continued through the downtown streets, moving west 20 blocks to police headquarters at 25th Street and First Avenue North, and then south on 25th Street. At about 1 p.m., the Fargo Police Department posted on its social media pages, asking people to avoid 13th Avenue South and 25th Street South because ""the area is becoming impassable."" Police later said the marchers were moving west toward West Acres mall but the group appeared to get smaller as time went on. Protesters shouted various chants, including ""I can't breathe"", referring to the fact that Floyd could be heard in a video of his arrest saying he couldn't breathe as the officer knelt on Floyd's neck. Protesters also chanted ""What's his name? George Floyd"", ""No justice, no peace"" and ""Prosecute the police."" Law enforcement officers in riot gear was stationed in front of Fargo police headquarters, but there have been no reports of violence. Moorhead Mayor Jonathan Judd and Fargo Mayor Tim Mahoney interacted with protesters at Fargo police headquarters, and the crowd moved on shortly afterward. Protesters headed west, eventually arriving at the West Fargo Police Department, where they peacefully protested for about a half hour while about 100 police officers from various jurisdictions stood watch, most wearing helmets and face shields. At one point, there was a mild confrontation between a nearby homeowner and some protesters. A half-dozen officers calmed the situation and the protesters kept marching through the street. Protester of all ages, some pushing baby strollers and walking with kids, are taking part, and some people have been handing out water, snacks and masks.

I think that is just terrible,” Fargo Mayor Tim Mahoney said at about 1:30 p.m., not knowing he was foreshadowing the violent riots that would strike downtown hours later. For much of the day, protesters remained nonviolent, showing up at 10 a.m. in Island Park for an event called “Fargo Marches for George Floyd."" The march, similar to other demonstrations in cities around the country, was triggered by the death of George Floyd, a black man who died in Minneapolis police custody Monday, May 25, after a white officer, Derek Chauvin, knelt on his neck for several minutes, as fellow officers stood by. Chauvin has been charged with murder and manslaughter. listen live watch live In Fargo, protesters marched through downtown to police headquarters at 25th Street North and First Avenue North, where the mayors spoke to the crowd. “The two mayors being here defused the situation,” Fargo Police Chief David Todd said Saturday afternoon outside police headquarters. “What (Moorhead Mayor Johnathan Judd) and I did was put ourselves into the crowd, and that defused the crowd,"" Mahoney said. Protesters of all races who joined the peaceful daytime march said they wanted all people to be treated with equality. They wanted more black police officers, and to be able to send their children to the store for Skittles without fear of violence. While Deputy Chief Todd Osmundson jumped up with protest organizers and held up a sign, Judd pressed the flesh, telling protesters they all needed to become more involved in the community. “We have that community here,” Judd said. “A community that elected me as a mayor. We gotta get better and get out of the upper Midwest way of communicating. Help me understand your reality so I can become someone who walks with you.” Todd and Mahoney said they did not have an estimate of the peaceful crowd’s size, but it appeared to number roughly 2,000 people. Before protesters began their march — which was supposed to be centered around downtown, but ended up 20 blocks away at Fargo police headquarters — organizers, pastors and a city leader gave impassioned speeches in Island Park. “We are not looked upon as human beings. We are looked at as people who were once property,” said organizer Ritchell Aboah, who’s also a candidate for Fargo City Commission. “But not everyone in the U.S. is racist. We are tired of injustice. We are tired of crying. Now it is our time, and we ask that everyone stand with us.” Aboah pleaded with the white people in the crowd to use their white privilege to help people of color. “I’m fed up. I can’t breathe anymore. I can’t walk in the streets and look at the police,” said organizer Angelina Zokego of Fargo. “When you see me, what do you see?” Zokego asked the crowd. “What is it about my color that you fear?” “No justice, no peace,” the crowd yelled. Not far from the picnic table where organizers spoke, a man with an airsoft rifle helped protesters roll out a sheet of paper, where the words “I can’t breathe” were spray painted. Behind him, Pete Tefft, a self-proclaimed white supremacist, held up a sign that said “Police kill more whites.” Tefft, who was the only known counter-protester at the peaceful rally, was later chased away. Fargo City Commissioner John Strand said he had “never seen a protest so large before in North Dakota.” “I don’t know of anything more important than standing up for what you believe in,” Strand said. “Today, I join you with a full heart and I stand with you.” “Good morning, America. I am a racist and I need help. This madness has to end. Admitting we have a problem is a good first step,” Strand added. Pastor Gloria Shields of the Latter Rain Ministries stood up to say she has been quiet for too long because she didn’t want to incite violence and disunity. “But I have come to the realization that we, as the church of God, have to stand up,” Shields said. “We all deserve to live. No other human has the right to take it away.” As the crowd grew, some in the crowd heckled speakers, asking where the police were, and why didn’t officers put down their badges and join the protest. The protesters began marching through downtown, taking up blocks at a time, before turning right onto First Avenue South. Police officers were waiting outside headquarters when the protesters arrived. At least two carried pepperball guns. All wore face shields due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, Mahoney said. Most protesters also wore protective face masks, but social distancing was impossible among such large numbers. “They made their own route,” Todd said of marchers at about 1:30 p.m. before the downtown riot began. “But I’m glad that they got the chance to express their feelings."" Jessica Schindeldecker, a Fargo police spokeswoman, reported no arrests by mid-afternoon. Protesters made their way to West Fargo, eventually arriving at the West Fargo Police Department, where they peacefully demonstrated for about a half hour while about 100 police officers from various jurisdictions stood watch, most wearing helmets and face shields. At one point, there was a mild confrontation between a nearby homeowner and some protesters. A half-dozen officers calmed the situation, and the protesters kept marching through the street. After listening to complaints and posing for pictures with protesters, Todd said the Fargo Police Department has been trying to hire more people of color and will continue to do so. “It’s always good for a police department to reflect the community,” the chief said.",0.0

I think that is just terrible,” Fargo Mayor Tim Mahoney said after protesters who were part of an event called “Fargo Marches for George Floyd” left Fargo police headquarters at 25th Street North and First Avenue North. Mahoney was referring to his reaction to watching the Minneapolis riots triggered by the death of George Floyd, a black man who died in police custody Monday, May 25, after a white officer knelt on his neck for several minutes, as fellow officers stood by. “The two mayors being here defused the situation,” Fargo Police Chief David Todd said Saturday. “I was very, very nervous, but very happy about the result,” Mahoney said of Fargo’s peaceful demonstration. “What Judd and I did was put ourselves into the crowd, and that defused the crowd.” listen live watch live Protesters of all races who joined the march said they wanted all people to be treated with equality. They wanted more black police officers, and to be able to send their children to the store for Skittles without fear of violence. While Deputy Chief Todd Osmundson jumped up with protest organizers and held up a sign, Moorhead, Minn., Mayor Johnathan Judd, who is black, pressed the flesh, telling protesters they all needed to become more involved in the community. “We have that community here,” Judd said. “A community that elected me as a mayor. We gotta get better and get out of the Upper Midwest way of communicating. Help me understand your reality so I can become someone who walks with you.” Todd and Mahoney said they did not have an estimate of the protest crowd’s size, but it appeared to number roughly 2,000 people. The throng showed up at Island Park about 10 a.m. Before protesters began their march — which was supposed to be centered around downtown, but ended up 20 blocks away at Fargo police headquarters — organizers, pastors and a city leader gave impassioned speeches. “We are not looked upon as human beings. We are looked at as people who were once property,” said organizer Ritchell Aboah, who’s also a candidate for Fargo City Commission. “But not everyone in the U.S. is racist. We are tired of injustice. We are tired of crying. Now it is our time, and we ask that everyone stand with us.” Aboah pleaded with the white people in the crowd to use their white privilege to help people of color. “I’m fed up. I can’t breathe anymore. I can’t walk in the streets and look at the police,” said organizer Angelina Zokego of Fargo. “When you see me, what do you see?” Zokego asked the crowd. “What is it about my color that you fear?” “No justice, no peace,” the crowd yelled. Not far from the picnic table where organizers spoke, a man with an airsoft rifle helped protesters roll out a sheet of paper, where the words “I can’t breathe” were spray painted.

Blame spread as quickly as the flames after a night of unrest claimed multiple businesses that succumbed to fire. Saturday, May 30 marked the fifth day of rallies and protests since George Floyd died in police custody Monday, May 25 after one of four arresting Minneapolis Police officers knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes, captured on an eyewitness video. After days of peaceful demonstrations and destructive riots alike, government officials vowed today to crack down on later — some of whom they claim are being instigated by out-of-state groups bent on inciting violence.

Kurt Joseph, a Minneapolis activist, spoke to the crowd but turned around to face the precinct building, aiming his megaphone at police watching from the roof. listen live watch live ""Do you hear us?"" Joseph asked. “No one body in this crowd has got a gun,” he said. ""We’re not going to hurt you."" The area had earlier been center of a clash between demonstrators and police late Friday, May 29 and early Saturday morning. Further east down Lake Street, the Minneapolis Third Precinct building was heavily damaged by fire earlier in the week. Area leaders expressed optimism about early crowd control efforts. Even with a weekend curfew in effect as of 8 p.m., local, county and state public safety agencies have already reported fires and arrests in different parts of the cities. Still, Maj. Gen. Jon Jensen, head of the Minnesota National Guard, said during Saturday's late night press event that the service branch is ""in a position of strength."" Hundreds of police and National Guard soldiers pushed protesters west down Lake Avenue firing canisters of chemical irritant and rubber bullets into the crowd. But officials conceded during press appearances Saturday that local law enforcement failed to adequately respond to the frenzy. Reinforcing them tonight are an estimated 2,5000 Minnesota National Guard airmen and soldiers who Gov. Tim Walz had deployed in the state's first full mobilization of the service branch. An additional 7,000 to 10,000 may yet be deployed, according to a Guard news release. Walz and others said during a Saturday afternoon, May 30, press conference that they have reason to believe that some of the groups responsible for looting and fires reported in Minneapolis and St. Paul may have criminal ties. But late into the evening, officials were evasive about the source and validity of the intelligence that suggested outside groups are infiltrating demonstrations. Walz said that he still believed the intelligence to be credible but left open the possibility that information collected during arrests made tonight may ultimately suggest otherwise. Early in the evening Walz expressed their support for peaceful protesters and made a final appeal for them to stay at home overnight. ""I am asking each and every Minnesotan to be clear about this. These are not our neighbors. These are not the people that put in the work to build Lake Street, to build community,"" Walz said. In anticipation of further unrest, local business owners throughout the metro area have boarded up shop throughout the Twin Cities area. Minneapolis, St. Paul and many surrounding suburbs instituted an 8 p.m. curfew on Saturday. The Minnesota Department of Transportation also announced major interstates and highways into the Twin Cities would close at 7 p.m. until 6 a.m. Sunday. All four of the officers involved in the incident Monday, meanwhile, have been fired. One, Derek Chauvin, was charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter Thursday. None of the other officers have been charged — all sources of anger for assembling crowds. Near the police station, Joseph urged the crowd to stay vigilant to fight for justice but to fight against impulses to destroy the community. He said agitators, most of them white, were causing most of the problems. A constant vigil at the site where Floyd died has been free of serious violence or fires, which community leaders say is because people there are wary of outsiders and people are directing their anger toward change. “It takes something other than what’s inside us as individual human beings,” said The Rev. Brian Herron, one of the people leading some of the vigils. Outside the Fifth Precinct building, Joseph also alluded to a bigger cause and urged the crowd to disregard the narrative that people were destroying their own communities. However, he also directed blame toward racism within police departments across the U.S. “We’re standing amid a war zone that they started,” he said.

PAUL — In the early hours of Sunday, May 31, officials said Minnesota law enforcement have gotten a hold on the Twin Cities' days-long string of riots, stealing and arson fires. Minnesota Department of Corrections Commissioner Paul Schnell told reporters at 1 a.m. Sunday that residents can ""rest a little easier"" after officials substantially beefed up police and National Guard presence and operations Saturday. The increased policing came following four days of protesting 46-year-old George Floyd's death in police custody on Monday night. While some protests remained peaceful, many sparked confrontations between demonstrators and police. Incidents of violence, looting and arson began cropping up around the metro, some of which officials pin on potential outside criminal groups intent on causing more mayhem. Early Sunday, Schnell said public safety officials do not see themselves as ""out of the woods"" yet, but things were better off in the hours prior to a 1 a.m. press conference than earlier this week. Most of the groups that officers intercepted were smaller than in previous nights, he said -- between five and 20 people each. He also said earlier Saturday that officers successfully scattered a group congregating near the Minneapolis Police Department's 5th Precinct. Officials did not immediately have available updated arrest numbers. Schnell said the number was ""in the dozens,"" but added that the booking process has taken longer than usual. listen live watch live Many of the arrests as of late Saturday were for curfew violations, though a tweet from the state Department of Public Safety said that it arrested several individuals for gun violations. Schnell said he was not positive of the exact number of additional officers out patrolling the Twin Cities Saturday night, but said the number was ""in the hundreds."" He also gave credit to Saturday night's relative return to normalcy to residents' ""incredible levels of compliance"" with Saturday night's 8 p.m. curfew, as well as a commitment to protecting their neighborhoods. Whether to extend the curfew beyond Saturday night is left to Gov. Tim Walz and local officials, he said. ""Do I think we’ve made progress tonight? Yes. Do I think we will have a better sense as we get into this tomorrow? Yes,"" Schnell said. ""Ultimately, the goal is to restore the situation to a point where regular, normal police operations are adequate."" Hours earlier, Walz told reporters that Minneapolis and St. Paul were in for a ""long night,"" and was followed by other state officials who projected a sense of early optimism over their grasp on the situation. Local, county and state public safety agencies reported fires and arrests in different parts of the cities throughout the night, but Maj. Gen. Jon Jensen, head of the Minnesota National Guard, said late Saturday that the service branch was ""in a position of strength."" The Minnesota Department of Transportation closed several major interstates and highways into the Twin Cities from 7 p.m. Saturday until 6 a.m. Sunday. Walz earlier Saturday order a full mobilization of the Guard, the first in its history in Minnesota. Guard news releases indicate that approximately 2,500 airmen and soldiers are assisting local authorities this evening. An additional 7,000 to 10,000 may be deployed. Per an executive order Walz signed Saturday, public safety departments from jurisdiction are adding to the numbers of local ones already at work. Schnell and other officials stressed, however, that the night was still young. ""Some of the groups that are here are in it for the long haul,"" he said. Prior to nightfall, demonstrators struck a mostly peaceful tone on Saturday. Officials have expressed support for such protests and have gone as far as to condemn the nature of Floyd's death outright. Floyd, who was black, died Monday evening following a confrontation with police officers responding to a counterfeiting incident reported by a south Minneapolis convenience store. Officers located him inside a vehicle matching one described in the initial call to police. Derek Chauvin, 44, the white officer who a bystander captured on video kneeling on a handcuffed Floyd's neck shortly before he died, was fired this week, arrested and charged with murder in the third degree and manslaughter. Walz and others have decried the act as a murder, and a protest that started in Minneapolis briefly boiled over in neighboring St. Paul this week before spreading to other U.S. cities. Amid the calls for justice reform, however, are widespread reports of destructive behavior. But many communities have rebounded to clean up battered storefronts and buildings under the light of day. Government officials at the state and local level, including Walz and the mayors of Minneapolis and St. Paul, have said repeatedly now they have reason to believe that groups from outside the region and with ties to organized crime may be responsible for looting and riots that were carried out amid protests over Floyd's death in recent days. State and city officials have been evasive, however, about the source and validity of the intelligence that suggested outside groups are infiltrating demonstrations. Walz said that he still believed the intelligence to be credible but left open the possibility that information collected during arrests made tonight may ultimately suggest otherwise. A message sent to the DPS requesting more information on claims of outside actors was not immediately returned. In anticipation of further unrest, more and more local business owners throughout the metro area have responded by boarding up shop throughout the Twin Cities area before nightfall. Major highways leading into the cities were scheduled to close to through traffic beginning at 7 p.m. on Saturday. Though criticism has been leveled at the law enforcement response to this week's more violent events, officials insisted that Saturday night would be different. In addition to a heftier police presence on the ground, Walz said that airborne surveillance methods would be used as well.",0.0

EMBED: Saturday George Floyd protest live video The protest began at the memorial with speeches, and moved along First Street toward City Hall, with protesters shouting, ""No justice, no peace.

A previous protest by the same organizers started at the intersection of 21st Avenue East and London Road in Duluth on Wednesday evening, drawing more than 100 people. Other protests in the Northland have been promoted on social media. The Hibbing Police Department said in a news release Saturday that it received “several reports” of groups planning to protest Sunday at Hibbing High School and Monday at Hibbing City Hall. “The Hibbing Police Department respects a peaceful protest and asks the public to use safety during the protest if it occurs,” the news release read. “We want to remind the public that protesting on private property without permission is not allowed. We also want to remind the public that blocking city streets and throughways is also not allowed without the proper permit issued by the city of Hibbing.” “Justice for George Floyd,” another event promoted on Facebook as a “peaceful protest,” is scheduled for noon Sunday outside the St. Louis County Courthouse in Virginia.

I think that is just terrible,” Fargo Mayor Tim Mahoney said after protesters who were part of an event called “Fargo Marches for George Floyd” left Fargo police headquarters at 25th Street North and First Avenue North. Mahoney was referring to his reaction to watching the Minneapolis riots triggered by the death of George Floyd, a black man who died in police custody Monday, May 25, after a white officer knelt on his neck for several minutes, as fellow officers stood by. “The two mayors being here defused the situation,” Fargo Police Chief David Todd said Saturday. “I was very, very nervous, but very happy about the result,” Mahoney said of Fargo’s peaceful demonstration. “What Judd and I did was put ourselves into the crowd, and that defused the crowd.” listen live watch live Protesters of all races who joined the march said they wanted all people to be treated with equality. They wanted more black police officers, and to be able to send their children to the store for Skittles without fear of violence. While Deputy Chief Todd Osmundson jumped up with protest organizers and held up a sign, Moorhead, Minn., Mayor Johnathan Judd, who is black, pressed the flesh, telling protesters they all needed to become more involved in the community. “We have that community here,” Judd said. “A community that elected me as a mayor. We gotta get better and get out of the Upper Midwest way of communicating. Help me understand your reality so I can become someone who walks with you.” Todd and Mahoney said they did not have an estimate of the protest crowd’s size, but it appeared to number roughly 2,000 people. The throng showed up at Island Park about 10 a.m. Before protesters began their march — which was supposed to be centered around downtown, but ended up 20 blocks away at Fargo police headquarters — organizers, pastors and a city leader gave impassioned speeches. “We are not looked upon as human beings. We are looked at as people who were once property,” said organizer Ritchell Aboah, who’s also a candidate for Fargo City Commission. “But not everyone in the U.S. is racist. We are tired of injustice. We are tired of crying. Now it is our time, and we ask that everyone stand with us.” Aboah pleaded with the white people in the crowd to use their white privilege to help people of color. “I’m fed up. I can’t breathe anymore. I can’t walk in the streets and look at the police,” said organizer Angelina Zokego of Fargo. “When you see me, what do you see?” Zokego asked the crowd. “What is it about my color that you fear?” “No justice, no peace,” the crowd yelled. Not far from the picnic table where organizers spoke, a man with an airsoft rifle helped protesters roll out a sheet of paper, where the words “I can’t breathe” were spray painted. Behind him, Pete Tefft, a self-proclaimed white supremacist, held up a sign that said, “Police kill more whites.” Tefft, who was the only known counter-protester, was later chased from the rally. Fargo City Commissioner John Strand said he had “never seen a protest so large before in North Dakota.” “I don’t know of anything more important than standing up for what you believe in,” Strand said. “Today, I join you with a full heart and I stand with you. For generations they said the next revolution will not be televised, but the next revolution — this revolution — is being documented by the people.” “Good morning, America. I am a racist and I need help. This madness has to end. Admitting we have a problem is a good first step,” Strand added. Pastor Gloria Shields of the Latter Rain Ministries stood up to say she has been quiet for too long because she didn’t want to incite violence and disunity. “But I have come to the realization that we, as the church of God, have to stand up,” Shields said. “We all deserve to live. No other human has the right to take it away.” As the crowd grew, some in the crowd heckled speakers, asking where the police were, and why didn’t officers put down their badges and join the protest. The protesters began marching through downtown, taking up blocks at a time, before turning toward the Fargo Police Department headquarters. Police officers were waiting in the yard when the protesters arrived. At least two carried pepperball guns. All wore face shields because of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, Mahoney said. Most protesters also wore protective face masks, but social distancing was impossible among such large numbers. “They made their own route,” Todd said. “But I’m glad that they got the chance to express their feelings. I’m glad that so far it’s been relatively peaceful.” Jessica Schindeldecker, a police spokeswoman, reported no arrests by mid-afternoon. Todd said he was worried about the size of the crowd as they took over 25th Street South, stopping traffic in all directions. “It’s my job to worry,” the chief said. “I was expecting a lot of people — hoping for the best, preparing for the worst.” After listening to complaints and posing for pictures with protesters, he said the Fargo Police Department has been hiring people of color and will continue to try to do so. “It’s always good for a police department to reflect the community,” Todd said.

Government officials at the state and local level, including Walz and the mayors of Minneapolis and St. Paul, have said repeatedly now they have reason to believe that groups from outside the region and with ties to organized crime may be responsible for looting and riots that were carried out amid protests over Floyd's death in recent days. State and city officials have been evasive, however, about the source and validity of the intelligence that suggested outside groups are infiltrating demonstrations. Walz said that he still believed the intelligence to be credible but left open the possibility that information collected during arrests made tonight may ultimately suggest otherwise.

I think that is just terrible,” Fargo Mayor Tim Mahoney said after protesters who were part of an event called “Fargo Marches for George Floyd” left Fargo police headquarters at 25th Street North and First Avenue North. Mahoney was referring to his reaction to watching the Minneapolis riots triggered by the death of George Floyd, a black man who died in police custody Monday, May 25, after a white officer knelt on his neck for several minutes, as fellow officers stood by. “The two mayors being here defused the situation,” Fargo Police Chief David Todd said Saturday. “I was very, very nervous, but very happy about the result,” Mahoney said of Fargo’s peaceful demonstration. “What Judd and I did was put ourselves into the crowd, and that defused the crowd.” listen live watch live Protesters of all races who joined the march said they wanted all people to be treated with equality. They wanted more black police officers, and to be able to send their children to the store for Skittles without fear of violence. While Deputy Chief Todd Osmundson jumped up with protest organizers and held up a sign, Moorhead, Minn., Mayor Johnathan Judd, who is black, pressed the flesh, telling protesters they all needed to become more involved in the community. “We have that community here,” Judd said. “A community that elected me as a mayor. We gotta get better and get out of the Upper Midwest way of communicating. Help me understand your reality so I can become someone who walks with you.” Todd and Mahoney said they did not have an estimate of the protest crowd’s size, but it appeared to number roughly 2,000 people. The throng showed up at Island Park about 10 a.m. Before protesters began their march — which was supposed to be centered around downtown, but ended up 20 blocks away at Fargo police headquarters — organizers, pastors and a city leader gave impassioned speeches. “We are not looked upon as human beings. We are looked at as people who were once property,” said organizer Ritchell Aboah, who’s also a candidate for Fargo City Commission. “But not everyone in the U.S. is racist. We are tired of injustice. We are tired of crying. Now it is our time, and we ask that everyone stand with us.” Aboah pleaded with the white people in the crowd to use their white privilege to help people of color. “I’m fed up. I can’t breathe anymore. I can’t walk in the streets and look at the police,” said organizer Angelina Zokego of Fargo. “When you see me, what do you see?” Zokego asked the crowd. “What is it about my color that you fear?” “No justice, no peace,” the crowd yelled. Not far from the picnic table where organizers spoke, a man with an airsoft rifle helped protesters roll out a sheet of paper, where the words “I can’t breathe” were spray painted. Behind him, Pete Tefft, a self-proclaimed white supremacist, held up a sign that said, “Police kill more whites.” Tefft, who was the only known counter-protester, was later chased from the rally. Fargo City Commissioner John Strand said he had “never seen a protest so large before in North Dakota.” “I don’t know of anything more important than standing up for what you believe in,” Strand said. “Today, I join you with a full heart and I stand with you. For generations they said the next revolution will not be televised, but the next revolution — this revolution — is being documented by the people.” “Good morning, America. I am a racist and I need help. This madness has to end. Admitting we have a problem is a good first step,” Strand added. Pastor Gloria Shields of the Latter Rain Ministries stood up to say she has been quiet for too long because she didn’t want to incite violence and disunity. “But I have come to the realization that we, as the church of God, have to stand up,” Shields said. “We all deserve to live. No other human has the right to take it away.” As the crowd grew, some in the crowd heckled speakers, asking where the police were, and why didn’t officers put down their badges and join the protest. The protesters began marching through downtown, taking up blocks at a time, before turning toward the Fargo Police Department headquarters. Police officers were waiting in the yard when the protesters arrived. At least two carried pepperball guns. All wore face shields because of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, Mahoney said. Most protesters also wore protective face masks, but social distancing was impossible among such large numbers. “They made their own route,” Todd said. “But I’m glad that they got the chance to express their feelings. I’m glad that so far it’s been relatively peaceful.” Jessica Schindeldecker, a police spokeswoman, reported no arrests by mid-afternoon. Todd said he was worried about the size of the crowd as they took over 25th Street South, stopping traffic in all directions. “It’s my job to worry,” the chief said. “I was expecting a lot of people — hoping for the best, preparing for the worst.” After listening to complaints and posing for pictures with protesters, he said the Fargo Police Department has been hiring people of color and will continue to try to do so. “It’s always good for a police department to reflect the community,” Todd said. Mahoney said he learned a lesson from the protest. “I’ve got a lot of frustrated people, and I will continue to look into their requests,” the mayor said.",0.0

Jon Jensen, head of the Minnesota National Guard, said during Saturday's late night press event that the service branch is ""in a position of strength."" Hundreds of police and National Guard soldiers pushed protesters west down Lake Avenue firing canisters of chemical irritant and rubber bullets into the crowd. But officials conceded during press appearances Saturday that local law enforcement failed to adequately respond to the frenzy. Reinforcing them tonight are an estimated 2,5000 Minnesota National Guard airmen and soldiers who Gov. Tim Walz had deployed in the state's first full mobilization of the service branch. An additional 7,000 to 10,000 may yet be deployed, according to a Guard news release. Walz and others said during a Saturday afternoon, May 30, press conference that they have reason to believe that some of the groups responsible for looting and fires reported in Minneapolis and St. Paul may have criminal ties. But late into the evening, officials were evasive about the source and validity of the intelligence that suggested outside groups are infiltrating demonstrations. Walz said that he still believed the intelligence to be credible but left open the possibility that information collected during arrests made tonight may ultimately suggest otherwise. Early in the evening Walz expressed their support for peaceful protesters and made a final appeal for them to stay at home overnight. ""I am asking each and every Minnesotan to be clear about this. These are not our neighbors. These are not the people that put in the work to build Lake Street, to build community,"" Walz said. In anticipation of further unrest, local business owners throughout the metro area have boarded up shop throughout the Twin Cities area. Minneapolis, St. Paul and many surrounding suburbs instituted an 8 p.m. curfew on Saturday. The Minnesota Department of Transportation also announced major interstates and highways into the Twin Cities would close at 7 p.m. until 6 a.m. Sunday. All four of the officers involved in the incident Monday, meanwhile, have been fired. One, Derek Chauvin, was charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter Thursday. None of the other officers have been charged — all sources of anger for assembling crowds. Near the police station, Joseph urged the crowd to stay vigilant to fight for justice but to fight against impulses to destroy the community. He said agitators, most of them white, were causing most of the problems. A constant vigil at the site where Floyd died has been free of serious violence or fires, which community leaders say is because people there are wary of outsiders and people are directing their anger toward change. “It takes something other than what’s inside us as individual human beings,” said The Rev. Brian Herron, one of the people leading some of the vigils. Outside the Fifth Precinct building, Joseph also alluded to a bigger cause and urged the crowd to disregard the narrative that people were destroying their own communities. However, he also directed blame toward racism within police departments across the U.S. “We’re standing amid a war zone that they started,” he said.

PAUL — In the early hours of Sunday, May 31, officials said Minnesota law enforcement have gotten a hold on the Twin Cities' days-long string of riots, stealing and arson fires. Minnesota Department of Corrections Commissioner Paul Schnell told reporters at 1 a.m. Sunday that residents can ""rest a little easier"" after officials substantially beefed up police and National Guard presence and operations Saturday. The increased policing came following four days of protesting 46-year-old George Floyd's death in police custody on Monday night. While some protests remained peaceful, many sparked confrontations between demonstrators and police. Incidents of violence, looting and arson began cropping up around the metro, some of which officials pin on potential outside criminal groups intent on causing more mayhem. Early Sunday, Schnell said public safety officials do not see themselves as ""out of the woods"" yet, but things were better off in the hours prior to a 1 a.m. press conference than earlier this week. Most of the groups that officers intercepted were smaller than in previous nights, he said -- between five and 20 people each. He also said earlier Saturday that officers successfully scattered a group congregating near the Minneapolis Police Department's 5th Precinct. Officials did not immediately have available updated arrest numbers. Schnell said the number was ""in the dozens,"" but added that the booking process has taken longer than usual. Many of the arrests as of late Saturday were for curfew violations, though a tweet from the state Department of Public Safety said that it arrested several individuals for gun violations. Schnell said he was not positive of the exact number of additional officers out patrolling the Twin Cities Saturday night, but said the number was ""in the hundreds."" He also gave credit to Saturday night's relative return to normalcy to residents' ""incredible levels of compliance"" with Saturday night's 8 p.m. curfew, as well as a commitment to protecting their neighborhoods. Whether to extend the curfew beyond Saturday night is left to Gov. Tim Walz and local officials, he said. ""Do I think we’ve made progress tonight? Yes. Do I think we will have a better sense as we get into this tomorrow? Yes,"" Schnell said.

George Floyd, the man on the ground in Minneapolis, died. The officer refused to ease the deadly pressure on his neck, despite Floyd’s repeated appeals captured on video – “I can’t breathe!” – and the pleading of horrified bystanders. He and three other officers who stood by and failed to intervene have been fired. Charges are likely. In Grand Forks, Officer Cody Holte died after coming to the aid of deputies attempting to serve eviction papers. A woman in the apartment also was killed by gunfire. Two others, including the man alleged to have initiated the gunfire and a Grand Forks County deputy sheriff, suffered gunshot injuries. The deputy sheriff was released from the hospital Thursday evening. In one city, the community has rightfully rallied to the fallen officer and to all men and women in blue, lighting the night sky with homage in blue, offering support and thanks for doing a difficult and often dangerous job. In the other city, anger led to looting, vandalism and the setting of fires, which will complicate efforts to bring about justice and a better world. listen live watch live The violence in Minneapolis is wrong. It will harden the attitudes of people inclined to believe that police are justified in the use of overwhelming force and paramilitary power. It will provide cover to people who have no interest in dealing with the long-festering, underlying reasons for anger. But hear the truth in words spoken more than 50 years ago by the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.: “A riot is the language of the unheard. And what is it that America has failed to hear? … It has failed to hear that the promises of freedom and justice have not been met. And it has failed to hear that large segments of white society are more concerned about tranquility and the status quo than about justice and humanity.” And hear the plaintive words of Jacob Frey, mayor of Minneapolis: “Being black in America should not be a death sentence. For five minutes, we watched a white officer press his knee into a black man’s neck. Five minutes.” George Floyd may have committed a crime. He may have committed many crimes. He may have initially resisted the officer. He may have had serious medical issues that contributed to his death. It doesn’t matter. He should not have stopped breathing because a police officer pressed his knee into his neck as he lay, handcuffed, on the street. Do you know these names? Eric Garner, New York. Michael Brown, Ferguson, Mo. Black people know those names and many others. They know how those men died. We have to accept that some police-involved shootings are justifiable, lawful. But that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t demand transparency, compassion and justice when they are not. Whenever I hear about a black man who dies in an interaction with police, I think of a friend, Jerry Holt, who was a colleague at the Star Tribune. He is a talented photographer, whether reporting from South Africa when Nelson Mandela was elected president, from Uganda during the AIDS epidemic, or from Twin Cities playgrounds where people helped disabled kids play baseball. He is many other things. He is a retired Marine. He is a father. He practices martial arts. And he is black. Many years ago, Jerry was chasing a breaking story in the suburbs of Minneapolis, where police were hunting for a suspect who had been identified as a black man. As Jerry approached several officers, cameras hanging from his neck, they drew their guns. This week, I asked him if the memory of that encounter returns at times like these. “You never forget when someone points a gun in your face,” he said. Investigations continue in both Minneapolis and Grand Forks, and more details may help us understand what happened. But this much we know: George Floyd should be alive today. Cody Holte should be alive today. And we know that things must change. We have to deal with insane income inequality. We have to deal with guns. We have to insist on better police training. We have to acknowledge and deal with the links between poverty, injustice, systemic racism, the militarization of urban police forces and crime.

PAUL — In the early hours of Sunday, May 31, officials said Minnesota law enforcement have gotten a hold on the Twin Cities' days-long string of riots, stealing and arson fires. Minnesota Department of Corrections Commissioner Paul Schnell told reporters at 1 a.m. Sunday that residents can ""rest a little easier"" after officials substantially beefed up police and National Guard presence and operations Saturday. The increased policing came following four days of protesting 46-year-old George Floyd's death in police custody on Monday night. While some protests remained peaceful, many sparked confrontations between demonstrators and police. Incidents of violence, looting and arson began cropping up around the metro, some of which officials pin on potential outside criminal groups intent on causing more mayhem. Early Sunday, Schnell said public safety officials do not see themselves as ""out of the woods"" yet, but things were better off in the hours prior to a 1 a.m. press conference than earlier this week. Most of the groups that officers intercepted were smaller than in previous nights, he said -- between five and 20 people each. He also said earlier Saturday that officers successfully scattered a group congregating near the Minneapolis Police Department's 5th Precinct. Officials did not immediately have available updated arrest numbers. Schnell said the number was ""in the dozens,"" but added that the booking process has taken longer than usual. listen live watch live Many of the arrests as of late Saturday were for curfew violations, though a tweet from the state Department of Public Safety said that it arrested several individuals for gun violations. Schnell said he was not positive of the exact number of additional officers out patrolling the Twin Cities Saturday night, but said the number was ""in the hundreds."" He also gave credit to Saturday night's relative return to normalcy to residents' ""incredible levels of compliance"" with Saturday night's 8 p.m. curfew, as well as a commitment to protecting their neighborhoods. Whether to extend the curfew beyond Saturday night is left to Gov. Tim Walz and local officials, he said. ""Do I think we’ve made progress tonight? Yes. Do I think we will have a better sense as we get into this tomorrow? Yes,"" Schnell said. ""Ultimately, the goal is to restore the situation to a point where regular, normal police operations are adequate."" Hours earlier, Walz told reporters that Minneapolis and St. Paul were in for a ""long night,"" and was followed by other state officials who projected a sense of early optimism over their grasp on the situation. Local, county and state public safety agencies reported fires and arrests in different parts of the cities throughout the night, but Maj. Gen. Jon Jensen, head of the Minnesota National Guard, said late Saturday that the service branch was ""in a position of strength."" The Minnesota Department of Transportation closed several major interstates and highways into the Twin Cities from 7 p.m. Saturday until 6 a.m. Sunday. Walz earlier Saturday order a full mobilization of the Guard, the first in its history in Minnesota. Guard news releases indicate that approximately 2,500 airmen and soldiers are assisting local authorities this evening. An additional 7,000 to 10,000 may be deployed. Per an executive order Walz signed Saturday, public safety departments from jurisdiction are adding to the numbers of local ones already at work. Schnell and other officials stressed, however, that the night was still young. ""Some of the groups that are here are in it for the long haul,"" he said. Prior to nightfall, demonstrators struck a mostly peaceful tone on Saturday. Officials have expressed support for such protests and have gone as far as to condemn the nature of Floyd's death outright. Floyd, who was black, died Monday evening following a confrontation with police officers responding to a counterfeiting incident reported by a south Minneapolis convenience store. Officers located him inside a vehicle matching one described in the initial call to police. Derek Chauvin, 44, the white officer who a bystander captured on video kneeling on a handcuffed Floyd's neck shortly before he died, was fired this week, arrested and charged with murder in the third degree and manslaughter. Walz and others have decried the act as a murder, and a protest that started in Minneapolis briefly boiled over in neighboring St. Paul this week before spreading to other U.S. cities. Amid the calls for justice reform, however, are widespread reports of destructive behavior. But many communities have rebounded to clean up battered storefronts and buildings under the light of day. Government officials at the state and local level, including Walz and the mayors of Minneapolis and St. Paul, have said repeatedly now they have reason to believe that groups from outside the region and with ties to organized crime may be responsible for looting and riots that were carried out amid protests over Floyd's death in recent days. State and city officials have been evasive, however, about the source and validity of the intelligence that suggested outside groups are infiltrating demonstrations. Walz said that he still believed the intelligence to be credible but left open the possibility that information collected during arrests made tonight may ultimately suggest otherwise. A message sent to the DPS requesting more information on claims of outside actors was not immediately returned. In anticipation of further unrest, more and more local business owners throughout the metro area have responded by boarding up shop throughout the Twin Cities area before nightfall. Major highways leading into the cities were scheduled to close to through traffic beginning at 7 p.m. on Saturday. Though criticism has been leveled at the law enforcement response to this week's more violent events, officials insisted that Saturday night would be different. In addition to a heftier police presence on the ground, Walz said that airborne surveillance methods would be used as well.",0.0

For five minutes, we watched a white officer press his knee into a black man’s neck. Five minutes.” George Floyd may have committed a crime. He may have committed many crimes. He may have initially resisted the officer. He may have had serious medical issues that contributed to his death. It doesn’t matter. He should not have stopped breathing because a police officer pressed his knee into his neck as he lay, handcuffed, on the street. Do you know these names? Eric Garner, New York.

Floyd, a black man, died in the custody of Minneapolis police after a white officer, Derek Chauvin, knelt on his neck for several minutes on Monday, May 25. Floyd's death has sparked massive protests in Minneapolis and other cities across the country. Chauvin has been arrested and charged with murder and manslaughter. The Fargo protest, which has so far remained peaceful, began at 10 a.m. at Island Park before it continued through the downtown streets, moving west 20 blocks to police headquarters at 25th Street and First Avenue North, and then south on 25th Street. At about 1 p.m., the Fargo Police Department posted on its social media pages, asking people to avoid 13th Avenue South and 25th Street South because ""the area is becoming impassable."" Police later said the marchers were moving west toward West Acres mall but the group appeared to get smaller as time went on. Protesters shouted various chants, including ""I can't breathe"", referring to the fact that Floyd could be heard in a video of his arrest saying he couldn't breathe as the officer knelt on Floyd's neck. Protesters also chanted ""What's his name? George Floyd"", ""No justice, no peace"" and ""Prosecute the police."" Law enforcement officers in riot gear was stationed in front of Fargo police headquarters, but there have been no reports of violence. Moorhead Mayor Jonathan Judd and Fargo Mayor Tim Mahoney interacted with protesters at Fargo police headquarters, and the crowd moved on shortly afterward. Protesters headed west, eventually arriving at the West Fargo Police Department, where they peacefully protested for about a half hour while about 100 police officers from various jurisdictions stood watch, most wearing helmets and face shields.

For several journalists across the country, the demonstrations were taking an ominous, dangerous turn. A reporter for Gray Television-owned WIS-TV in Columbia, South Carolina, was hit in the head by a thrown rock on Saturday. She later tweeted about the experience. Miranda Parnell says a person wearing a MAGA hat showed up at the rally, protesters confronted that person. Rocks were then thrown and one of them hit Parnell. Parnell. was taken from the scene to an area hospital and is okay. Earlier, a journalist in Minneapolis was shot in the thigh by a rubber bullet. Demonstrators also broke windows and vandalized the Atlanta office building where CNN is headquartered, and police in Louisville, Kentucky, apologized after an officer fired what appeared to be pepper bullets at a television news crew with WAVE, also owned by Gray Television. Fox's Leland Vittert was rattled following the Washington attack that he said was clearly targeted at his news organization. “We took a good thumping,” he told The Associated Press. A live shot he was doing was interrupted by a group of protesters who shouted obscenities directed at Fox. Flanked by two security guards, he and photographer Christian Galdabini walked away from Washington's Lafayette Park trailed by an angry group before riot police dispersed them. Vittert said there were no markings on him or the crew's equipment to identify them as from Fox. But he said during the demonstration, one man continually asked him who he worked for. He didn't answer, but the man found a picture of Vittert on his cell phone and shouted to other protesters that he was from Fox. “The protesters stopped protesting whatever it was they were protesting and turned on us,” he said, “and that was a very different feeling.” He compared it to when he was chased away from a demonstration in Egypt during the Arab Spring of 2011 by a group that shouted, “Fox News hates Muslims.” A correspondent from the website The Daily Caller followed Vittert and the demonstrators as they left the park. At one point, someone took Vittert's microphone and threw it at his back. One woman chasing him wore a t-shirt that said, “I can’t breathe,” a reference what Floyd said earlier this week when a Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee against his neck. Vittert said he was “extremely grateful” to the Daily Caller for documenting the scene; Galdabini’s camera was smashed. “They were putting themselves at risk,” he said. “It makes me proud to do my job and to be a journalist,” he said. “I'm proud to be an organization that is unyielding in our coverage. We're going to keep on telling our story and doing exactly what we're doing.” Suzanne Scott, CEO of Fox News Media, said in a memo on Saturday that Fox was taking all necessary security precautions to protect its journalists covering the story. “We are truly living in unprecedented and transformative times and freedom of the press is a vital element to the foundation of our society,” Scott wrote. On Friday, CNN correspondent Omar Jimenez and his two-person crew were arrested while covering overnight protests in Minneapolis. They were quickly released, and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz apologized to CNN. CNN's headquarters in Atlanta was targeted later Friday by a group of protesters who also fought with police and set cars afire. While police tried to keep them away from the CNN Center, demonstrators broke windows there and scrawled obscene graffiti on the network's logo. In Louisville, WAVE-TV was on the air covering a demonstration when video showed a police officer aiming a rifle at reporter Kaitlin Rust and her crew. She was heard yelling, “I’ve been shot! I’ve been shot!” and described them as pepper bullets. Louisville Police spokeswoman Jesse Halladay apologized for the incident, and said police would review the video for potential discipline. Demonstrators surrounded the police department headquarters in Columbia, S.C. on Saturday and a scuffle broke out with someone wearing a “Make America Great Again” hat. Rocks were thrown and Miranda Parnell, a television reporters from WIS-TV, was injured and taken to the hospital, according to a tweet from network anchor Judi Gatson. It was not clear who threw the rock that hit Parnell. In Minneapolis on Saturday, a Swedish journalist was shot in the thigh with a rubber bullet, apparently from a police gun, while covering a protest, according to the Norwegian newspaper VG. ___ AP correspondents Mike Stewart in Atlanta, Jari Tanner in Minneapolis and Bruce Schreiner and Dylan Lovan in Louisville, and Jeffrey S.

A large group of protesters gathered in First Avenue North just west of Broadway as riot gear-clad police formed a line in front of the crowd. The Fargo Police Department is asking the public to avoid downtown Fargo. Protesters faceoff with police in downtown Fargo FARGO — Roughly 2,000 demonstrators are still marching through the streets of Fargo and more recently West Fargo Saturday, May 30, in protest of the death of George Floyd. Floyd, a black man, died in the custody of Minneapolis police after a white officer, Derek Chauvin, knelt on his neck for several minutes on Monday, May 25. Floyd's death has sparked massive protests in Minneapolis and other cities across the country. Chauvin has been arrested and charged with murder and manslaughter. The Fargo protest, which has so far remained peaceful, began at 10 a.m. at Island Park before it continued through the downtown streets, moving west 20 blocks to police headquarters at 25th Street and First Avenue North, and then south on 25th Street. At about 1 p.m., the Fargo Police Department posted on its social media pages, asking people to avoid 13th Avenue South and 25th Street South because ""the area is becoming impassable."" Police later said the marchers were moving west toward West Acres mall but the group appeared to get smaller as time went on. Protesters shouted various chants, including ""I can't breathe"", referring to the fact that Floyd could be heard in a video of his arrest saying he couldn't breathe as the officer knelt on Floyd's neck. Protesters also chanted ""What's his name? George Floyd"", ""No justice, no peace"" and ""Prosecute the police."" Law enforcement officers in riot gear was stationed in front of Fargo police headquarters, but there have been no reports of violence. Moorhead Mayor Jonathan Judd and Fargo Mayor Tim Mahoney interacted with protesters at Fargo police headquarters, and the crowd moved on shortly afterward. Protesters headed west, eventually arriving at the West Fargo Police Department, where they peacefully protested for about a half hour while about 100 police officers from various jurisdictions stood watch, most wearing helmets and face shields. At one point, there was a mild confrontation between a nearby homeowner and some protesters. A half-dozen officers calmed the situation and the protesters kept marching through the street. Protester of all ages, some pushing baby strollers and walking with kids, are taking part, and some people have been handing out water, snacks and masks.

George Floyd, the man on the ground in Minneapolis, died. The officer refused to ease the deadly pressure on his neck, despite Floyd’s repeated appeals captured on video – “I can’t breathe!” – and the pleading of horrified bystanders. He and three other officers who stood by and failed to intervene have been fired. Charges are likely. In Grand Forks, Officer Cody Holte died after coming to the aid of deputies attempting to serve eviction papers. A woman in the apartment also was killed by gunfire. Two others, including the man alleged to have initiated the gunfire and a Grand Forks County deputy sheriff, suffered gunshot injuries. The deputy sheriff was released from the hospital Thursday evening. In one city, the community has rightfully rallied to the fallen officer and to all men and women in blue, lighting the night sky with homage in blue, offering support and thanks for doing a difficult and often dangerous job. In the other city, anger led to looting, vandalism and the setting of fires, which will complicate efforts to bring about justice and a better world. The violence in Minneapolis is wrong. It will harden the attitudes of people inclined to believe that police are justified in the use of overwhelming force and paramilitary power. It will provide cover to people who have no interest in dealing with the long-festering, underlying reasons for anger. But hear the truth in words spoken more than 50 years ago by the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.: “A riot is the language of the unheard. And what is it that America has failed to hear? … It has failed to hear that the promises of freedom and justice have not been met. And it has failed to hear that large segments of white society are more concerned about tranquility and the status quo than about justice and humanity.” And hear the plaintive words of Jacob Frey, mayor of Minneapolis: “Being black in America should not be a death sentence. For five minutes, we watched a white officer press his knee into a black man’s neck. Five minutes.” George Floyd may have committed a crime. He may have committed many crimes. He may have initially resisted the officer. He may have had serious medical issues that contributed to his death. It doesn’t matter. He should not have stopped breathing because a police officer pressed his knee into his neck as he lay, handcuffed, on the street. Do you know these names? Eric Garner, New York. Michael Brown, Ferguson, Mo. Black people know those names and many others. They know how those men died. We have to accept that some police-involved shootings are justifiable, lawful. But that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t demand transparency, compassion and justice when they are not. Whenever I hear about a black man who dies in an interaction with police, I think of a friend, Jerry Holt, who was a colleague at the Star Tribune. He is a talented photographer, whether reporting from South Africa when Nelson Mandela was elected president, from Uganda during the AIDS epidemic, or from Twin Cities playgrounds where people helped disabled kids play baseball. He is many other things. He is a retired Marine. He is a father. He practices martial arts. And he is black. Many years ago, Jerry was chasing a breaking story in the suburbs of Minneapolis, where police were hunting for a suspect who had been identified as a black man. As Jerry approached several officers, cameras hanging from his neck, they drew their guns. This week, I asked him if the memory of that encounter returns at times like these. “You never forget when someone points a gun in your face,” he said. Investigations continue in both Minneapolis and Grand Forks, and more details may help us understand what happened. But this much we know: George Floyd should be alive today. Cody Holte should be alive today. And we know that things must change. We have to deal with insane income inequality. We have to deal with guns. We have to insist on better police training. We have to acknowledge and deal with the links between poverty, injustice, systemic racism, the militarization of urban police forces and crime. On Minnesota Public Radio last year, as he approached his 30th year at the newspaper, Jerry Holt was asked, “What’s your vision for the future of black people in Minnesota?” He said he was optimistic, hopeful, “if we could figure out a way to … [improve] relationships with police officers, so it's safer for police officers and for citizens of all races — but, in particular, African-American men. “I worry a lot about things that are currently going on with that situation, but I am hopeful and very, very optimistic that those things will improve with education and lack of fear of people.” But once again, hope and optimism are strained.

1621202112,2020-05-30 19:59:00,Officials make final pitch for calm ahead in Twin Cities ahead of curfew,https://www.thedickinsonpress.com/news/crime-and-courts/6514100-Officials-make-final-pitch-for-calm-ahead-in-Twin-Cities-ahead-of-curfew,en,False,,98383,thedickinsonpress.com,http://www.thedickinsonpress.com/#spider,"ST. PAUL — In the early hours of Sunday, May 31, officials said Minnesota law enforcement have gotten a hold on the Twin Cities' days-long string of riots, stealing and arson fires. Minnesota Department of Corrections Commissioner Paul Schnell told reporters at 1 a.m. Sunday that residents can ""rest a little easier"" after officials substantially beefed up police and National Guard presence and operations Saturday. The increased policing came following four days of protesting 46-year-old George Floyd's death in police custody on Monday night. While some protests remained peaceful, many sparked confrontations between demonstrators and police. Incidents of violence, looting and arson began cropping up around the metro, some of which officials pin on potential outside criminal groups intent on causing more mayhem. Early Sunday, Schnell said public safety officials do not see themselves as ""out of the woods"" yet, but things were better off in the hours prior to a 1 a.m. press conference than earlier this week. Most of the groups that officers intercepted were smaller than in previous nights, he said -- between five and 20 people each. He also said earlier Saturday that officers successfully scattered a group congregating near the Minneapolis Police Department's 5th Precinct. Officials did not immediately have available updated arrest numbers. Schnell said the number was ""in the dozens,"" but added that the booking process has taken longer than usual. Many of the arrests as of late Saturday were for curfew violations, though a tweet from the state Department of Public Safety said that it arrested several individuals for gun violations. Schnell said he was not positive of the exact number of additional officers out patrolling the Twin Cities Saturday night, but said the number was ""in the hundreds."" He also gave credit to Saturday night's relative return to normalcy to residents' ""incredible levels of compliance"" with Saturday night's 8 p.m. curfew, as well as a commitment to protecting their neighborhoods. Whether to extend the curfew beyond Saturday night is left to Gov. Tim Walz and local officials, he said. ""Do I think we’ve made progress tonight? Yes. Do I think we will have a better sense as we get into this tomorrow? Yes,"" Schnell said. ""Ultimately, the goal is to restore the situation to a point where regular, normal police operations are adequate."" Hours earlier, Walz told reporters that Minneapolis and St. Paul were in for a ""long night,"" and was followed by other state officials who projected a sense of early optimism over their grasp on the situation. Local, county and state public safety agencies reported fires and arrests in different parts of the cities throughout the night, but Maj. Gen. Jon Jensen, head of the Minnesota National Guard, said late Saturday that the service branch was ""in a position of strength."" The Minnesota Department of Transportation closed several major interstates and highways into the Twin Cities from 7 p.m. Saturday until 6 a.m. Sunday. Walz earlier Saturday order a full mobilization of the Guard, the first in its history in Minnesota. Guard news releases indicate that approximately 2,500 airmen and soldiers are assisting local authorities this evening. An additional 7,000 to 10,000 may be deployed. Per an executive order Walz signed Saturday, public safety departments from jurisdiction are adding to the numbers of local ones already at work. Schnell and other officials stressed, however, that the night was still young. ""Some of the groups that are here are in it for the long haul,"" he said. Prior to nightfall, demonstrators struck a mostly peaceful tone on Saturday. Officials have expressed support for such protests and have gone as far as to condemn the nature of Floyd's death outright. Floyd, who was black, died Monday evening following a confrontation with police officers responding to a counterfeiting incident reported by a south Minneapolis convenience store. Officers located him inside a vehicle matching one described in the initial call to police. Derek Chauvin, 44, the white officer who a bystander captured on video kneeling on a handcuffed Floyd's neck shortly before he died, was fired this week, arrested and charged with murder in the third degree and manslaughter. Walz and others have decried the act as a murder, and a protest that started in Minneapolis briefly boiled over in neighboring St. Paul this week before spreading to other U.S. cities. Amid the calls for justice reform, however, are widespread reports of destructive behavior. But many communities have rebounded to clean up battered storefronts and buildings under the light of day. Government officials at the state and local level, including Walz and the mayors of Minneapolis and St. Paul, have said repeatedly now they have reason to believe that groups from outside the region and with ties to organized crime may be responsible for looting and riots that were carried out amid protests over Floyd's death in recent days. State and city officials have been evasive, however, about the source and validity of the intelligence that suggested outside groups are infiltrating demonstrations. Walz said that he still believed the intelligence to be credible but left open the possibility that information collected during arrests made tonight may ultimately suggest otherwise. A message sent to the DPS requesting more information on claims of outside actors was not immediately returned. In anticipation of further unrest, more and more local business owners throughout the metro area have responded by boarding up shop throughout the Twin Cities area before nightfall. Major highways leading into the cities were scheduled to close to through traffic beginning at 7 p.m. on Saturday. Though criticism has been leveled at the law enforcement response to this week's more violent events, officials insisted that Saturday night would be different. In addition to a heftier police presence on the ground, Walz said that airborne surveillance methods would be used as well.",0.0

Protesters faceoff with police in downtown Fargo FARGO — Roughly 2,000 demonstrators are still marching through the streets of Fargo and more recently West Fargo Saturday, May 30, in protest of the death of George Floyd. Floyd, a black man, died in the custody of Minneapolis police after a white officer, Derek Chauvin, knelt on his neck for several minutes on Monday, May 25. Floyd's death has sparked massive protests in Minneapolis and other cities across the country. Chauvin has been arrested and charged with murder and manslaughter. The Fargo protest, which has so far remained peaceful, began at 10 a.m. at Island Park before it continued through the downtown streets, moving west 20 blocks to police headquarters at 25th Street and First Avenue North, and then south on 25th Street. At about 1 p.m., the Fargo Police Department posted on its social media pages, asking people to avoid 13th Avenue South and 25th Street South because ""the area is becoming impassable."" Police later said the marchers were moving west toward West Acres mall but the group appeared to get smaller as time went on. Protesters shouted various chants, including ""I can't breathe"", referring to the fact that Floyd could be heard in a video of his arrest saying he couldn't breathe as the officer knelt on Floyd's neck. Protesters also chanted ""What's his name? George Floyd"", ""No justice, no peace"" and ""Prosecute the police."" Law enforcement officers in riot gear was stationed in front of Fargo police headquarters, but there have been no reports of violence. Moorhead Mayor Jonathan Judd and Fargo Mayor Tim Mahoney interacted with protesters at Fargo police headquarters, and the crowd moved on shortly afterward.

PAUL — In the early hours of Sunday, May 31, officials said Minnesota law enforcement have gotten a hold on the Twin Cities' days-long string of riots, stealing and arson fires. Minnesota Department of Corrections Commissioner Paul Schnell told reporters at 1 a.m. Sunday that residents can ""rest a little easier"" after officials substantially beefed up police and National Guard presence and operations Saturday. The increased policing came following four days of protesting 46-year-old George Floyd's death in police custody on Monday night. While some protests remained peaceful, many sparked confrontations between demonstrators and police. Incidents of violence, looting and arson began cropping up around the metro, some of which officials pin on potential outside criminal groups intent on causing more mayhem. Early Sunday, Schnell said public safety officials do not see themselves as ""out of the woods"" yet, but things were better off in the hours prior to a 1 a.m. press conference than earlier this week. Most of the groups that officers intercepted were smaller than in previous nights, he said -- between five and 20 people each. He also said earlier Saturday that officers successfully scattered a group congregating near the Minneapolis Police Department's 5th Precinct. Officials did not immediately have available updated arrest numbers. Schnell said the number was ""in the dozens,"" but added that the booking process has taken longer than usual. listen live watch live Many of the arrests as of late Saturday were for curfew violations, though a tweet from the state Department of Public Safety said that it arrested several individuals for gun violations. Schnell said he was not positive of the exact number of additional officers out patrolling the Twin Cities Saturday night, but said the number was ""in the hundreds."" He also gave credit to Saturday night's relative return to normalcy to residents' ""incredible levels of compliance"" with Saturday night's 8 p.m. curfew, as well as a commitment to protecting their neighborhoods. Whether to extend the curfew beyond Saturday night is left to Gov. Tim Walz and local officials, he said. ""Do I think we’ve made progress tonight? Yes. Do I think we will have a better sense as we get into this tomorrow? Yes,"" Schnell said. ""Ultimately, the goal is to restore the situation to a point where regular, normal police operations are adequate."" Hours earlier, Walz told reporters that Minneapolis and St. Paul were in for a ""long night,"" and was followed by other state officials who projected a sense of early optimism over their grasp on the situation. Local, county and state public safety agencies reported fires and arrests in different parts of the cities throughout the night, but Maj. Gen. Jon Jensen, head of the Minnesota National Guard, said late Saturday that the service branch was ""in a position of strength."" The Minnesota Department of Transportation closed several major interstates and highways into the Twin Cities from 7 p.m. Saturday until 6 a.m. Sunday. Walz earlier Saturday order a full mobilization of the Guard, the first in its history in Minnesota. Guard news releases indicate that approximately 2,500 airmen and soldiers are assisting local authorities this evening. An additional 7,000 to 10,000 may be deployed. Per an executive order Walz signed Saturday, public safety departments from jurisdiction are adding to the numbers of local ones already at work. Schnell and other officials stressed, however, that the night was still young. ""Some of the groups that are here are in it for the long haul,"" he said. Prior to nightfall, demonstrators struck a mostly peaceful tone on Saturday. Officials have expressed support for such protests and have gone as far as to condemn the nature of Floyd's death outright. Floyd, who was black, died Monday evening following a confrontation with police officers responding to a counterfeiting incident reported by a south Minneapolis convenience store. Officers located him inside a vehicle matching one described in the initial call to police. Derek Chauvin, 44, the white officer who a bystander captured on video kneeling on a handcuffed Floyd's neck shortly before he died, was fired this week, arrested and charged with murder in the third degree and manslaughter. Walz and others have decried the act as a murder, and a protest that started in Minneapolis briefly boiled over in neighboring St. Paul this week before spreading to other U.S. cities. Amid the calls for justice reform, however, are widespread reports of destructive behavior. But many communities have rebounded to clean up battered storefronts and buildings under the light of day. Government officials at the state and local level, including Walz and the mayors of Minneapolis and St. Paul, have said repeatedly now they have reason to believe that groups from outside the region and with ties to organized crime may be responsible for looting and riots that were carried out amid protests over Floyd's death in recent days. State and city officials have been evasive, however, about the source and validity of the intelligence that suggested outside groups are infiltrating demonstrations. Walz said that he still believed the intelligence to be credible but left open the possibility that information collected during arrests made tonight may ultimately suggest otherwise. A message sent to the DPS requesting more information on claims of outside actors was not immediately returned. In anticipation of further unrest, more and more local business owners throughout the metro area have responded by boarding up shop throughout the Twin Cities area before nightfall. Major highways leading into the cities were scheduled to close to through traffic beginning at 7 p.m. on Saturday. Though criticism has been leveled at the law enforcement response to this week's more violent events, officials insisted that Saturday night would be different. In addition to a heftier police presence on the ground, Walz said that airborne surveillance methods would be used as well.",0.0

Demonstrations were held in Fargo, Bismarck, Bemidji, Rochester, Willmar and Duluth, among others. A protest also was planned to take place later Saturday evening in East Grand Forks. In Fargo, there was a 2,000-person march through the city. Demonstrators chanted “I can’t breathe” – three of Floyd’s dying words – plus a call-and-response: “What’s his name? George Floyd!” “We are not looked upon as human beings. We are looked at as people who were once property,” organizer Ritchell Aboah, who’s also a candidate for Fargo City Commission, told demonstrators as they organized Saturday morning. “We are tired of injustice. We are tired of crying. Now it is our time, and we ask that everyone stand with us. listen live watch live Some city leaders, including Fargo Mayor Tim Mahoney and Moorhead Mayor Jonathun Judd, met with demonstrators. Mahoney joined a “black lives matter” chant outside police headquarters and Judd filtered through the crowd. Other Fargo officers held or posed for photographs next to signs that read “one race ... the human race!” and “justice for George.” Later Saturday, the protests turned ugly, as law enforcement had to use teargas to disperse crowds downtown and the city of Fargo declared a state of emergency because of the protests. In Bismarck, about 300 people carried signs and chanted as they marched a loop through the city and occasionally blocked traffic. Opie Day, a 44-year-old citizen of the Bois Forte Band of Chippewa who moved to Bismarck from the Twin Cities, led a drum group beforehand. “Not being able to be home in person, this is my way of contributing and letting them know that I’m with them,"" Day said. He also said he has been pulled out of cars and off of buses by law enforcement, which he believes is a product of his skin color. In Duluth, about 1,000 people gathered for a similar demonstration at the Clayton Jackson McGhie Memorial, which commemorates the three black men who were lynched on that spot by a mob in 1920. Organizers there held a similar protest on Wednesday, which drew more than 100 people. In Bemidji, between 300 and 400 marchers headed from the city’s iconic statues of Paul and Babe – which briefly became a racial flashpoint when someone painted “genocide” on the ox’s flank in early 2019 – to the Bemidji Police Department’s headquarters about half a mile away. ""The virus of racism is passed down from mother to daughter, from father to son,"" David Frison, a Bemidji State University professor, told marchers. ""When liberty is denied to all citizens, we can't breathe, America."" And in Rochester, more than 100 people marched through the center of the city, chanting “I can’t breathe” like their counterparts across the region. On Friday night, demonstrators there blocked Hwy. 52 and a few other downtown intersections. They ultimately broke a few windows, including one on a police cruiser. Civic leaders have instituted a 9 p.m. curfew on Saturday in the city’s core. But, other than a few thrown water bottles in Bismarck, the demonstrations in Rochester and Bemidji were the only ones outside the Twin Cities that reported any violence. Both instances were minor by comparison. In Bemidji on Saturday, demonstrators began roughing up a school resource officer’s truck and, as organizers pulled them back, a police officer hopped into the truck and backed it through some of the demonstrators as he drove away. It was not immediately apparent if any demonstrators were injured, and organizers and police officers shook hands after the confrontation. Saturday afternoon, the city of Bemidji announced an 8 o'clock curfew for Saturday evening. The marches and protests across Greater Minnesota have been smaller and more peaceful than those in the Metro, where Floyd’s killing has meant days of demonstrations that have sometimes turned to violence, including the takeover and burning of a police precinct and the ransacking of dozens of businesses, prompting Gov. Tim Walz to order the largest-ever mobilization of the Minnesota National Guard on Saturday. No one has died in the widespread protests there, but demonstrators, police and journalists all have reported myriad injuries. The protests also have turned toward looting and arson, and state and city leaders suggested on Saturday that the Twin Cities demonstrations have been joined by out-of-state agitators. About 15 protesters walked in and around downtown Willmar with signs reading “Black Lives Matter,” “Justice For Floyd,” and “I Can’t Breathe,” the words Floyd spoke moments before his death. Minneapolis, St. Paul and a multitude of surrounding suburbs instituted an 8 p.m. curfew on Saturday. The Minnesota Department of Transportation also announced major interstates and highways into the Twin Cities would close at 7 p.m. until 6 a.m. Sunday.

A large group of protesters gathered in First Avenue North just west of Broadway as riot gear-clad police formed a line in front of the crowd. The Fargo Police Department is asking the public to avoid downtown Fargo. Protesters faceoff with police in downtown Fargo FARGO — Roughly 2,000 demonstrators are still marching through the streets of Fargo and more recently West Fargo Saturday, May 30, in protest of the death of George Floyd. Floyd, a black man, died in the custody of Minneapolis police after a white officer, Derek Chauvin, knelt on his neck for several minutes on Monday, May 25. Floyd's death has sparked massive protests in Minneapolis and other cities across the country. Chauvin has been arrested and charged with murder and manslaughter. The Fargo protest, which has so far remained peaceful, began at 10 a.m. at Island Park before it continued through the downtown streets, moving west 20 blocks to police headquarters at 25th Street and First Avenue North, and then south on 25th Street. At about 1 p.m., the Fargo Police Department posted on its social media pages, asking people to avoid 13th Avenue South and 25th Street South because ""the area is becoming impassable."" Police later said the marchers were moving west toward West Acres mall but the group appeared to get smaller as time went on. Protesters shouted various chants, including ""I can't breathe"", referring to the fact that Floyd could be heard in a video of his arrest saying he couldn't breathe as the officer knelt on Floyd's neck. Protesters also chanted ""What's his name? George Floyd"", ""No justice, no peace"" and ""Prosecute the police."" Law enforcement officers in riot gear was stationed in front of Fargo police headquarters, but there have been no reports of violence. Moorhead Mayor Jonathan Judd and Fargo Mayor Tim Mahoney interacted with protesters at Fargo police headquarters, and the crowd moved on shortly afterward. Protesters headed west, eventually arriving at the West Fargo Police Department, where they peacefully protested for about a half hour while about 100 police officers from various jurisdictions stood watch, most wearing helmets and face shields. At one point, there was a mild confrontation between a nearby homeowner and some protesters. A half-dozen officers calmed the situation and the protesters kept marching through the street. Protester of all ages, some pushing baby strollers and walking with kids, are taking part, and some people have been handing out water, snacks and masks.

Demonstrations were held in Fargo, Bismarck, Bemidji, Rochester, Willmar and Duluth, among others. A protest also was planned to take place later Saturday evening in East Grand Forks. In Fargo, there was a 2,000-person march through the city. Demonstrators chanted “I can’t breathe” – three of Floyd’s dying words – plus a call-and-response: “What’s his name? George Floyd!” “We are not looked upon as human beings. We are looked at as people who were once property,” organizer Ritchell Aboah, who’s also a candidate for Fargo City Commission, told demonstrators as they organized Saturday morning. “We are tired of injustice. We are tired of crying.

Mahoney joined a “black lives matter” chant outside police headquarters and Judd filtered through the crowd. Other Fargo officers held or posed for photographs next to signs that read “one race ... the human race!” and “justice for George.” Late Saturday, the city of Fargo declared a state of emergency because of the protests and instituted a 10 p.m. curfew. In Bismarck, about 300 people carried signs and chanted as they marched a loop through the city and occasionally blocked traffic. Opie Day, a 44-year-old citizen of the Bois Forte Band of Chippewa who moved to Bismarck from the Twin Cities, led a drum group beforehand. “Not being able to be home in person, this is my way of contributing and letting them know that I’m with them,"" Day said. He also said he has been pulled out of cars and off of buses by law enforcement, which he believes is a product of his skin color. In Duluth, about 1,000 people gathered for a similar demonstration at the Clayton Jackson McGhie Memorial, which commemorates the three black men who were lynched on that spot by a mob in 1920. Organizers there held a similar protest on Wednesday, which drew more than 100 people. City officials later set a 10 p.m. curfew in Duluth. In Bemidji, between 300 and 400 marchers headed from the city’s iconic statues of Paul and Babe – which briefly became a racial flashpoint when someone painted “genocide” on the ox’s flank in early 2019 – to the Bemidji Police Department’s headquarters about half a mile away. ""The virus of racism is passed down from mother to daughter, from father to son,"" David Frison, a Bemidji State University professor, told marchers. ""When liberty is denied to all citizens, we can't breathe, America."" And in Rochester, more than 100 people marched through the center of the city, chanting “I can’t breathe” like their counterparts across the region. On Friday night, demonstrators there blocked Hwy. 52 and a few other downtown intersections. They ultimately broke a few windows, including one on a police cruiser. Civic leaders have instituted a 9 p.m. curfew on Saturday in the city’s core. But, other than a few thrown water bottles in Bismarck, the demonstrations in Rochester and Bemidji were the only ones outside the Twin Cities that reported any violence. Both instances were minor by comparison. In Bemidji on Saturday, demonstrators began roughing up a school resource officer’s truck and, as organizers pulled them back, a police officer hopped into the truck and backed it through some of the demonstrators as he drove away. It was not immediately apparent if any demonstrators were injured, and organizers and police officers shook hands after the confrontation. Saturday afternoon, the city of Bemidji announced an 8 o'clock curfew for Saturday evening. The marches and protests across Greater Minnesota have been smaller and more peaceful than those in the Metro, where Floyd’s killing has meant days of demonstrations that have sometimes turned to violence, including the takeover and burning of a police precinct and the ransacking of dozens of businesses, prompting Gov. Tim Walz to order the largest-ever mobilization of the Minnesota National Guard on Saturday. No one has died in the widespread protests there, but demonstrators, police and journalists all have reported myriad injuries. The protests also have turned toward looting and arson, and state and city leaders suggested on Saturday that the Twin Cities demonstrations have been joined by out-of-state agitators. About 15 protesters walked in and around downtown Willmar with signs reading “Black Lives Matter,” “Justice For Floyd,” and “I Can’t Breathe,” the words Floyd spoke moments before his death Minneapolis, St. Paul and a multitude of surrounding suburbs instituted an 8 p.m. curfew on Saturday.

Demonstrations were held in Fargo, Bismarck, Bemidji, Rochester, Willmar and Duluth, among others. A protest also was planned to take place later Saturday evening in East Grand Forks. In Fargo, there was a 2,000-person march through the city. Demonstrators chanted “I can’t breathe” – three of Floyd’s dying words – plus a call-and-response: “What’s his name? George Floyd!” “We are not looked upon as human beings. We are looked at as people who were once property,” organizer Ritchell Aboah, who’s also a candidate for Fargo City Commission, told demonstrators as they organized Saturday morning. “We are tired of injustice. We are tired of crying. Now it is our time, and we ask that everyone stand with us.” Some city leaders, including Fargo Mayor Tim Mahoney and Moorhead Mayor Jonathun Judd, met with demonstrators. Mahoney joined a “black lives matter” chant outside police headquarters and Judd filtered through the crowd. Other Fargo officers held or posed for photographs next to signs that read “one race ... the human race!” and “justice for George.” Late Saturday, the city of Fargo declared a state of emergency because of the protests and instituted a 10 p.m. curfew. In Bismarck, about 300 people carried signs and chanted as they marched a loop through the city and occasionally blocked traffic. Opie Day, a 44-year-old citizen of the Bois Forte Band of Chippewa who moved to Bismarck from the Twin Cities, led a drum group beforehand. “Not being able to be home in person, this is my way of contributing and letting them know that I’m with them,"" Day said. He also said he has been pulled out of cars and off of buses by law enforcement, which he believes is a product of his skin color. In Duluth, about 1,000 people gathered for a similar demonstration at the Clayton Jackson McGhie Memorial, which commemorates the three black men who were lynched on that spot by a mob in 1920. Organizers there held a similar protest on Wednesday, which drew more than 100 people. City officials later set a 10 p.m. curfew in Duluth. In Bemidji, between 300 and 400 marchers headed from the city’s iconic statues of Paul and Babe – which briefly became a racial flashpoint when someone painted “genocide” on the ox’s flank in early 2019 – to the Bemidji Police Department’s headquarters about half a mile away. ""The virus of racism is passed down from mother to daughter, from father to son,"" David Frison, a Bemidji State University professor, told marchers. ""When liberty is denied to all citizens, we can't breathe, America."" And in Rochester, more than 100 people marched through the center of the city, chanting “I can’t breathe” like their counterparts across the region. On Friday night, demonstrators there blocked Hwy. 52 and a few other downtown intersections. They ultimately broke a few windows, including one on a police cruiser. Civic leaders have instituted a 9 p.m. curfew on Saturday in the city’s core. But, other than a few thrown water bottles in Bismarck, the demonstrations in Rochester and Bemidji were the only ones outside the Twin Cities that reported any violence. Both instances were minor by comparison. In Bemidji on Saturday, demonstrators began roughing up a school resource officer’s truck and, as organizers pulled them back, a police officer hopped into the truck and backed it through some of the demonstrators as he drove away. It was not immediately apparent if any demonstrators were injured, and organizers and police officers shook hands after the confrontation. Saturday afternoon, the city of Bemidji announced an 8 o'clock curfew for Saturday evening. The marches and protests across Greater Minnesota have been smaller and more peaceful than those in the Metro, where Floyd’s killing has meant days of demonstrations that have sometimes turned to violence, including the takeover and burning of a police precinct and the ransacking of dozens of businesses, prompting Gov. Tim Walz to order the largest-ever mobilization of the Minnesota National Guard on Saturday. No one has died in the widespread protests there, but demonstrators, police and journalists all have reported myriad injuries. The protests also have turned toward looting and arson, and state and city leaders suggested on Saturday that the Twin Cities demonstrations have been joined by out-of-state agitators. About 15 protesters walked in and around downtown Willmar with signs reading “Black Lives Matter,” “Justice For Floyd,” and “I Can’t Breathe,” the words Floyd spoke moments before his death Minneapolis, St. Paul and a multitude of surrounding suburbs instituted an 8 p.m. curfew on Saturday. The Minnesota Department of Transportation also announced major interstates and highways into the Twin Cities would close at 7 p.m. until 6 a.m. Sunday.

Floyd, a black man, died in the custody of Minneapolis police after a white officer, Derek Chauvin, knelt on his neck for several minutes on Monday, May 25. Floyd's death has sparked massive protests in Minneapolis and other cities across the country. Chauvin has been arrested and charged with murder and manslaughter. The Fargo protest, which has so far remained peaceful, began at 10 a.m. at Island Park before it continued through the downtown streets, moving west 20 blocks to police headquarters at 25th Street and First Avenue North, and then south on 25th Street. At about 1 p.m., the Fargo Police Department posted on its social media pages, asking people to avoid 13th Avenue South and 25th Street South because ""the area is becoming impassable."" Police later said the marchers were moving west toward West Acres mall but the group appeared to get smaller as time went on.

1621238430,2020-05-30 22:08:53,Majority of those arrested in George Floyd protests and riots gave Minnesota addresses,https://www.inforum.com/news/crime-and-courts/6514867-Majority-of-those-arrested-in-George-Floyd-protests-and-riots-gave-Minnesota-addresses,en,False,,98987,inforum.com,http://www.inforum.com/#spider,"State officials said Saturday, May 30, that a number of outsiders are fueling the destruction and rioting in the Twin Cities. Gov. Tim Walz estimated on Saturday morning that about 80 percent of the people causing problems Friday night were from outside Minnesota. Later Saturday, he said, “We’ll find out when this is over. We’ll have a much bigger data set after tonight and we’ll be able to see what’s happening.” Hennepin County jail records and arrest records in St. Paul show the majority of those in custody gave Minnesota addresses. Four of 18 people arrested in St. Paul between Thursday and Saturday at 6 a.m. were from out of state — from Fort Worth, Texas, La Crosse, Wis., Grand Forks and Fargo. Two did not have addresses listed. The rest of the arrests in St. Paul were people from Minnesota: listen live watch live Five from St. Paul Three from Woodbury Two from Minneapolis One from St. Louis Park One from Mankato. “The number of arrests we’ve made is a very, very small percent of the people who are out there causing problems,” Steve Linders, a St. Paul police spokesman, said Saturday. “We’ve been focused on protecting people and firefighters so they can protect property. I don’t think you can look at 18 people and say it reflects the total number of people out there causing problems.” Protests have been underway since George Floyd died in Minneapolis police custody on Monday and unrest has been growing, with rioting, looting and arson being seen. Derek Chauvin, who has been fired from the Minneapolis police department, was charged Friday with third-degree murder and manslaughter. Minnesota Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington said Saturday that as officials make arrests, they are investigating who those individuals are and whether they are associated with any groups. “We have seen things like white supremacist organizers posting on platforms about coming to Minnesota,” Harrington said. He added that officials are also looking into connections with organized crime. MINNEAPOLIS ARRESTS The Hennepin County Sheriff’s Office provided the following details about arrests from 12:20 a.m. Friday to 11:21 a.m. Saturday, saying 42 of 57 people booked into the jail in connected to protesting gave a Minnesota address: 32 were from Minneapolis or St. Paul 13 were from other metro cities 2 were from non metro cities 10 were from other states/information not provided. A Pioneer Press analysis of Hennepin County jail records revealed details about eight arrested who gave addresses from other states. They were: A Miramar, Fla., man, 22 , for burglary A Temperance, Mich., man, 27, for riot A Chicago man, 19, for burglary A Chicago man, 22, for burglary A Sutton, Ark., man, 21, for burglary A Matteson, Ill., man, 47, for possession of burglary tools A Kansas City, Mo., man, 29, for riot An Ames, Iowa man, 22, was being held on a weapons charge. The rest of those in the jail after protest-related arrests were from other Minnesota cities, including Brooklyn Park, Hastings, Blaine, Burnsville, Lakeville, Big Lake, New Brighton and Inver Grove Heights. U.S. AG: ‘RADICAL ELEMENTS’ HIJACKING PEACEFUL PROTESTS Attorney General William P. Barr said in a Saturday statement that while the outrage about Floyd’s death was real and legitimate, it is also being exploited by agitators. “Unfortunately, with the rioting that is occurring in many of our cities around the country, the voices of peaceful protest are being hijacked by violent radical elements,” his statement said. “Groups of outside radicals and agitators are exploiting the situation to pursue their own separate and violent agenda,” Barr continued. “In many places, it appears the violence is planned, organized, and driven by anarchistic and far left extremists, using Antifa-like tactics, many of whom travel from out of state to promote the violence. We must have law and order on our streets and in our communities, and it is the responsibility of the local and state leadership, in the first instance, to halt this violence.” Barr also noted that it was a federal crime to “cross state lines or to use interstate facilities to incite or participate in violent rioting. We will enforce these laws.” Meanwhile, the St. Paul Branch of the NAACP released a statement on Saturday condemning the violence that accompanied protests as a “mockery of our long-standing efforts to create a peaceful society built on mutual respect, justice, and equality for all.” The NAACP said while it supports protesting “as a legitimate way of expressing the community’s sadness, anger, and frustration at the continued and systematic oppression of people of color in Minnesota and throughout our country” it condemns the violence that accompanied the protests.

The Fargo Police Department is asking the public to avoid downtown Fargo. Protesters faceoff with police in downtown Fargo FARGO — Roughly 2,000 demonstrators are still marching through the streets of Fargo and more recently West Fargo Saturday, May 30, in protest of the death of George Floyd. Floyd, a black man, died in the custody of Minneapolis police after a white officer, Derek Chauvin, knelt on his neck for several minutes on Monday, May 25. Floyd's death has sparked massive protests in Minneapolis and other cities across the country. Chauvin has been arrested and charged with murder and manslaughter. The Fargo protest, which has so far remained peaceful, began at 10 a.m. at Island Park before it continued through the downtown streets, moving west 20 blocks to police headquarters at 25th Street and First Avenue North, and then south on 25th Street. At about 1 p.m., the Fargo Police Department posted on its social media pages, asking people to avoid 13th Avenue South and 25th Street South because ""the area is becoming impassable."" Police later said the marchers were moving west toward West Acres mall but the group appeared to get smaller as time went on. Protesters shouted various chants, including ""I can't breathe"", referring to the fact that Floyd could be heard in a video of his arrest saying he couldn't breathe as the officer knelt on Floyd's neck. Protesters also chanted ""What's his name? George Floyd"", ""No justice, no peace"" and ""Prosecute the police."" Law enforcement officers in riot gear was stationed in front of Fargo police headquarters, but there have been no reports of violence. Moorhead Mayor Jonathan Judd and Fargo Mayor Tim Mahoney interacted with protesters at Fargo police headquarters, and the crowd moved on shortly afterward. Protesters headed west, eventually arriving at the West Fargo Police Department, where they peacefully protested for about a half hour while about 100 police officers from various jurisdictions stood watch, most wearing helmets and face shields. At one point, there was a mild confrontation between a nearby homeowner and some protesters. A half-dozen officers calmed the situation and the protesters kept marching through the street. Protester of all ages, some pushing baby strollers and walking with kids, are taking part, and some people have been handing out water, snacks and masks.

Many demonstrators grew hoarse chanting ""black lives matter"" and ""I can't breathe"" during the five-mile trek through Bismarck. Others wore facemasks that muffled the sound of their spirited cries to ""say his name,"" in reference to George Floyd, a black man who died in the custody of Minneapolis police on Monday, May 25. Derek Chauvin, the white now-fired officer who videos showed kneeling on Floyd's neck during the arrest, has been charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. Opie Day moved to Bismarck a year ago after living most of the rest of his life in the Twin Cities. The 44-year-old citizen of the Bois Forte Band of Chippewa emerged as one of the protest's leaders and performed several songs on drum that he said radiate unity and good feelings in his Native American community. Day said he and many other Native Americans have been victimized by police discrimination just like other people of color. He added that Floyd's death and the ensuing unrest in his hometown ""really hits home."" “Not being able to be home in person, this is my way of contributing and letting them know that I’m with them,"" Day said. “It just breaks my heart to see my city like that — like a warzone.” listen live watch live Day noted that he was surprised and heartened by how many demonstrators showed up Saturday in Bismarck, which is a politically conservative city. In addition to Day, many other protest leaders were members of Native American tribes. Zach Raknerud, who is running for U.S. House of Representatives on the Democratic-NPL ticket, drove down from his native Minot to show support for protesters who are ""fed up"" by what they perceive as unfair policing practices. ""Even in a community that isn't as diverse as some other areas, we still stand up for each other and we still understand there's pain in our community too,"" Raknerud said.

This continues tonight in the peace garden state. Reporter Aaron Fields was on the scene. Peaceful protestor Mary Kempenich says, “I came out here because I firmly believe if justice is to prevail good people have to speak up even if they aren’t the people who are getting hurt. And when people who aren’t impacted by violence don’t say anything– you’re making the problem worse.” Hundreds of people gathered today in Bismarck to not only mourn the loss of George Floyd, but to peacefully make a stand for the the Black Lives Matter movement. Another peaceful protestor Karen Clayton says, “However I know that a lot of individuals who want to be apart of something larger than themselves –they want to have solidarity and and have support and be able to express how they are feeling.” This was Karen Clayton’s first Black Lives Matter Movement and she says it’s been breaking her heart to see all the violent protests going on in the world right now. “At the end of the day what have we accomplished– we have accomplished blowing off steam,” says Clayton. “And when I say we– we are all connected. We have accomplished separating each other even more so. We are not accomplishing what we can.” Clayton says if we can’t come together in peace and take this moment as a way to grow then we are doing it all wrong. Clayton tells me she thinks some people have been taking advantage of the Black Lives Matter Movement. “Yes… black lives matter, white lives matter, oriental lives matter, African American lives matter, eskimo’s lives matter, natives, all lives matter. We matter to god and we have to matter to each other,” says Clayton. From her experience here in North Dakota, she says she’s always felt protected by the police force. And not to judge one bad apple from the bunch. They are here to protect us,” says Clayton. “Only one person or two people can’t speak for everyone and I just always want to see something positive.” Clayton does always see the positive… even during our interview when a random truck passing by yelled out racial slurs. “F**** BLACK LIVES and F**** YOU,” they shouted. But Clayton’s response: “Yeah I just saw that flag when it made that right turn and I felt the spirt before it opened it’s mouth, but I learned we have to pray for people when we see stuff like that.” Her next words were “I’m not moved by darkness– I’m moved by love.” “We can only overcome evil with love and with good and not more evil. It doesn’t work–and I refuse to live in the dark because I am the light.” There was also a vigil candle-light ceremony in honor of George Floyd. After 9 tonight, cops were stationed around the city but KX News didn’t see any signs of continued protest.",0.0

At about 1 p.m., the Fargo Police Department posted on its social media pages, asking people to avoid 13th Avenue South and 25th Street South because ""the area is becoming impassable."" Police later said the marchers were moving west toward West Acres mall but the group appeared to get smaller as time went on. Protesters shouted various chants, including ""I can't breathe"", referring to the fact that Floyd could be heard in a video of his arrest saying he couldn't breathe as the officer knelt on Floyd's neck. Protesters also chanted ""What's his name? George Floyd"", ""No justice, no peace"" and ""Prosecute the police."" Law enforcement officers in riot gear was stationed in front of Fargo police headquarters, but there have been no reports of violence. Moorhead Mayor Jonathan Judd and Fargo Mayor Tim Mahoney interacted with protesters at Fargo police headquarters, and the crowd moved on shortly afterward. Protesters headed west, eventually arriving at the West Fargo Police Department, where they peacefully protested for about a half hour while about 100 police officers from various jurisdictions stood watch, most wearing helmets and face shields. At one point, there was a mild confrontation between a nearby homeowner and some protesters. A half-dozen officers calmed the situation and the protesters kept marching through the street. Protester of all ages, some pushing baby strollers and walking with kids, are taking part, and some people have been handing out water, snacks and masks.

Their candlelight vigil was marked by candid, often tearful speeches about race in America and the destruction in the Twin Cities, which were rocked by a fifth consecutive night of demonstrations that have grown exponentially more violent and chaotic. “If two people are having a conversation and one person’s not listening, somebody’s going to react,” Jerrylin Paye told the crowd. “And that’s what’s happening in Minneapolis right now.” Teagan Kempe, 26, read from a letter she wrote to Floyd. “You were slain. A modern-day lynching before our eyes, in our own backyard, in our stomping grounds,” she read as her voice trembled. “I am torn apart thinking about how finding the positives in your death are supposed to work. Is that what we are supposed to do? Maybe it is. In your death you have helped reignite my fire for life. There is a lot of work to be done. There are systems that need to be rebuilt. There are a lot of journeys that need to be taken.” listen live watch live Tawanda Murinda, a pastor at St. Matthew’s Lutheran Church in Thompson, barely needed the microphone. “We talk about the Holy Spirit as the breath of God,” Murinda exhorted. “And if we have racists and racism and all systems of oppression -- what those systems do, they suck the breath of God out of our communities.” Murinda encouraged “good” police officers to speak out against “those that are not being good.” “We need you, as police officers, to protect us,” he said. “That’s all we are asking for.” The vigil was also intended to memorialize Cody Holte, a Grand Forks officer who died assisting county deputies on Wednesday “Neither one of them deserved what happened,” Devon Pope, the vigil’s foremost organizer, said of Floyd and Holte. “There’s too many good people being taken away from life too early. We need more love.” Pope said some of his members have been victims of police brutality and hoped the vigil would be an outlet for peace. But there were still echoes of the broader racial conflict. People in passing cars would occasionally offer a timid chirp at the demonstrators before flooring it down DeMers Avenue. One car blared the song “[expletive] the police!” by the band N.W.A. A passenger in a passing car said “I can!” to a woman in a hijab holding a sign that said “I can’t breathe” -- a reference to three of Floyd’s dying words and those of Eric Garner, a New York City black man who was choked to death by police in 2014. Meanwhile, 70 miles to the south, protests in Fargo took a different turn. After peaceful demonstrations throughout most of the day, the evening hours saw a change. Protesters there broke windows downtown and looted at least one restaurant. Police, wearing riot gear, shot what appeared to be tear-gas canisters as protesters started a fire in the middle of a street.",0.0

PAUL — In the early hours of Sunday, May 31, officials said Minnesota law enforcement have gotten a hold on the Twin Cities' days-long string of riots, stealing and arson fires. Minnesota Department of Corrections Commissioner Paul Schnell told reporters at 1 a.m. Sunday that residents can ""rest a little easier"" after officials substantially beefed up police and National Guard presence and operations Saturday. The increased policing came following four days of protesting 46-year-old George Floyd's death in police custody on Monday night. While some protests remained peaceful, many sparked confrontations between demonstrators and police. Incidents of violence, looting and arson began cropping up around the metro, some of which officials pin on potential outside criminal groups intent on causing more mayhem. Early Sunday, Schnell said public safety officials do not see themselves as ""out of the woods"" yet, but things were better off in the hours prior to a 1 a.m. press conference than earlier this week. Most of the groups that officers intercepted were smaller than in previous nights, he said -- between five and 20 people each. He also said earlier Saturday that officers successfully scattered a group congregating near the Minneapolis Police Department's 5th Precinct. Officials did not immediately have available updated arrest numbers. Schnell said the number was ""in the dozens,"" but added that the booking process has taken longer than usual. listen live watch live Many of the arrests as of late Saturday were for curfew violations, though a tweet from the state Department of Public Safety said that it arrested several individuals for gun violations. Schnell said he was not positive of the exact number of additional officers out patrolling the Twin Cities Saturday night, but said the number was ""in the hundreds."" He also gave credit to Saturday night's relative return to normalcy to residents' ""incredible levels of compliance"" with Saturday night's 8 p.m. curfew, as well as a commitment to protecting their neighborhoods. Whether to extend the curfew beyond Saturday night is left to Gov. Tim Walz and local officials, he said. ""Do I think we’ve made progress tonight? Yes. Do I think we will have a better sense as we get into this tomorrow? Yes,"" Schnell said. ""Ultimately, the goal is to restore the situation to a point where regular, normal police operations are adequate."" Hours earlier, Walz told reporters that Minneapolis and St. Paul were in for a ""long night,"" and was followed by other state officials who projected a sense of early optimism over their grasp on the situation. Local, county and state public safety agencies reported fires and arrests in different parts of the cities throughout the night, but Maj. Gen. Jon Jensen, head of the Minnesota National Guard, said late Saturday that the service branch was ""in a position of strength.""

Guard news releases indicate that approximately 2,500 airmen and soldiers are assisting local authorities this evening. An additional 7,000 to 10,000 may be deployed. Per an executive order Walz signed Saturday, public safety departments from jurisdiction are adding to the numbers of local ones already at work. Schnell and other officials stressed, however, that the night was still young. ""Some of the groups that are here are in it for the long haul,"" he said. Prior to nightfall, demonstrators struck a mostly peaceful tone on Saturday. Officials have expressed support for such protests and have gone as far as to condemn the nature of Floyd's death outright. Floyd, who was black, died Monday evening following a confrontation with police officers responding to a counterfeiting incident reported by a south Minneapolis convenience store. Officers located him inside a vehicle matching one described in the initial call to police. Derek Chauvin, 44, the white officer who a bystander captured on video kneeling on a handcuffed Floyd's neck shortly before he died, was fired this week, arrested and charged with murder in the third degree and manslaughter. Walz and others have decried the act as a murder, and a protest that started in Minneapolis briefly boiled over in neighboring St. Paul this week before spreading to other U.S. cities. Amid the calls for justice reform, however, are widespread reports of destructive behavior. But many communities have rebounded to clean up battered storefronts and buildings under the light of day. Government officials at the state and local level, including Walz and the mayors of Minneapolis and St. Paul, have said repeatedly now they have reason to believe that groups from outside the region and with ties to organized crime may be responsible for looting and riots that were carried out amid protests over Floyd's death in recent days. State and city officials have been evasive, however, about the source and validity of the intelligence that suggested outside groups are infiltrating demonstrations. Walz said that he still believed the intelligence to be credible but left open the possibility that information collected during arrests made tonight may ultimately suggest otherwise.

1621287242,2020-05-31 00:28:00,Twin Cities brace for a 'long night' authorities projecting an early handle on unrest,https://www.agweek.com/news/crime-and-courts/6514100-Twin-Cities-brace-for-a-long-night-authorities-projecting-an-early-handle-on-unrest,en,False,,32092,agweek.com,http://www.agweek.com#spider,"ST. PAUL — In the early hours of Sunday, May 31, officials said Minnesota law enforcement have gotten a hold on the Twin Cities' days-long string of riots, stealing and arson fires. Minnesota Department of Corrections Commissioner Paul Schnell told reporters at 1 a.m. Sunday that residents can ""rest a little easier"" after officials substantially beefed up police and National Guard presence and operations Saturday. The increased policing came following four days of protesting 46-year-old George Floyd's death in police custody on Monday night. While some protests remained peaceful, many sparked confrontations between demonstrators and police. Incidents of violence, looting and arson began cropping up around the metro, some of which officials pin on potential outside criminal groups intent on causing more mayhem. Early Sunday, Schnell said public safety officials do not see themselves as ""out of the woods"" yet, but things were better off in the hours prior to a 1 a.m. press conference than earlier this week. Most of the groups that officers intercepted were smaller than in previous nights, he said -- between five and 20 people each. He also said earlier Saturday that officers successfully scattered a group congregating near the Minneapolis Police Department's 5th Precinct. Officials did not immediately have available updated arrest numbers. Schnell said the number was ""in the dozens,"" but added that the booking process has taken longer than usual. Many of the arrests as of late Saturday were for curfew violations, though a tweet from the state Department of Public Safety said that it arrested several individuals for gun violations. Schnell said he was not positive of the exact number of additional officers out patrolling the Twin Cities Saturday night, but said the number was ""in the hundreds."" He also gave credit to Saturday night's relative return to normalcy to residents' ""incredible levels of compliance"" with Saturday night's 8 p.m. curfew, as well as a commitment to protecting their neighborhoods. Whether to extend the curfew beyond Saturday night is left to Gov. Tim Walz and local officials, he said. ""Do I think we’ve made progress tonight? Yes. Do I think we will have a better sense as we get into this tomorrow? Yes,"" Schnell said. ""Ultimately, the goal is to restore the situation to a point where regular, normal police operations are adequate."" Hours earlier, Walz told reporters that Minneapolis and St. Paul were in for a ""long night,"" and was followed by other state officials who projected a sense of early optimism over their grasp on the situation. Local, county and state public safety agencies reported fires and arrests in different parts of the cities throughout the night, but Maj. Gen. Jon Jensen, head of the Minnesota National Guard, said late Saturday that the service branch was ""in a position of strength."" The Minnesota Department of Transportation closed several major interstates and highways into the Twin Cities from 7 p.m. Saturday until 6 a.m. Sunday. Walz earlier Saturday order a full mobilization of the Guard, the first in its history in Minnesota. Guard news releases indicate that approximately 2,500 airmen and soldiers are assisting local authorities this evening. An additional 7,000 to 10,000 may be deployed. Per an executive order Walz signed Saturday, public safety departments from jurisdiction are adding to the numbers of local ones already at work. Schnell and other officials stressed, however, that the night was still young. ""Some of the groups that are here are in it for the long haul,"" he said. Prior to nightfall, demonstrators struck a mostly peaceful tone on Saturday. Officials have expressed support for such protests and have gone as far as to condemn the nature of Floyd's death outright. Floyd, who was black, died Monday evening following a confrontation with police officers responding to a counterfeiting incident reported by a south Minneapolis convenience store. Officers located him inside a vehicle matching one described in the initial call to police. Derek Chauvin, 44, the white officer who a bystander captured on video kneeling on a handcuffed Floyd's neck shortly before he died, was fired this week, arrested and charged with murder in the third degree and manslaughter. Walz and others have decried the act as a murder, and a protest that started in Minneapolis briefly boiled over in neighboring St. Paul this week before spreading to other U.S. cities.

Crowds overtook the streets as police officers tried to keep the march contained and helped people stuck in between get out of the way. Protesters we spoke to say it’s about sending a message but not crossing a line of violence. “Enough police brutality, we are not busting buildings, no public destruction of property we are not in police face we are not violent,” Protestor Manny Smith said. The protest hit its peak at the Fargo Police Department Station on 25th street as people went down on their knees in front of cops as a sign to protest police brutality. Fargo Mayor Tim Mahomey, Moorhead Mayor Johnthan Judd and Fargo Police Chief David Todd all showed up in front of the crowd as police are armed with riot gear. The department says in a social media post they support a peaceful march but are prepared should that change. “I grew up in a housing project. I know what it’s like to be in an area where you feel that there is no hope and there are no resources to help anybody. Enough is enough, I understand,” Mayor Jonathan Judd said. Protestors made stops at multiple intersections along the route to help regroup and represent in as many places around town as possible. “We are reaching out to state and local officials to let them know that we could come together as one and stop police brutality and lets come together as one,”Smith said. These marchers crossed over a dozen miles all through the day by bike, car or just on foot. In a stand for what they say is unity and change, not further division. “I have a son of color whose name is Metta and I don’t want anyone picked up and treated like this in the United States Of America, Fargo Mayor Tim Mahoney said.",0.0

Their candlelight vigil was marked by candid, often tearful speeches about race in America and the destruction in the Twin Cities, which were rocked by a fifth consecutive night of demonstrations that have grown exponentially more violent and chaotic. “If two people are having a conversation and one person’s not listening, somebody’s going to react,” Jerrylin Paye told the crowd. “And that’s what’s happening in Minneapolis right now.” Teagan Kempe, 26, read from a letter she wrote to Floyd. “You were slain. A modern-day lynching before our eyes, in our own backyard, in our stomping grounds,” she read as her voice trembled. “I am torn apart thinking about how finding the positives in your death are supposed to work. Is that what we are supposed to do? Maybe it is. In your death you have helped reignite my fire for life. There is a lot of work to be done. There are systems that need to be rebuilt. There are a lot of journeys that need to be taken.” listen live watch live Tawanda Murinda, a pastor at St. Matthew’s Lutheran Church in Thompson, barely needed the microphone. “We talk about the Holy Spirit as the breath of God,” Murinda exhorted. “And if we have racists and racism and all systems of oppression -- what those systems do, they suck the breath of God out of our communities.” Murinda encouraged “good” police officers to speak out against “those that are not being good.” “We need you, as police officers, to protect us,” he said. “That’s all we are asking for.” The vigil was also intended to memorialize Cody Holte, a Grand Forks officer who died assisting county deputies on Wednesday “Neither one of them deserved what happened,” Devon Pope, the vigil’s foremost organizer, said of Floyd and Holte. “There’s too many good people being taken away from life too early. We need more love.” Pope said some of his members have been victims of police brutality and hoped the vigil would be an outlet for peace. But there were still echoes of the broader racial conflict. People in passing cars would occasionally offer a timid chirp at the demonstrators before flooring it down DeMers Avenue. One car blared the song “[expletive] the police!” by the band N.W.A. A passenger in a passing car said “I can!” to a woman in a hijab holding a sign that said “I can’t breathe” -- a reference to three of Floyd’s dying words and those of Eric Garner, a New York City black man who was choked to death by police in 2014. Meanwhile, 70 miles to the south, protests in Fargo took a different turn. After peaceful demonstrations throughout most of the day, the evening hours saw a change. Protesters there broke windows downtown and looted at least one restaurant.

Protesters demonstrate against the death of George Floyd, a black man who was in police custody in Minneapolis, Friday, May 29, 2020, in New York. (Source: AP Photo/Mary Altaffer) “This can be kind of a tinderbox for COVID,"" the 39-year-old venture capitalist said after attending a demonstration in Florida, one of many around the country sparked by the death of George Floyd, a black man who died after he was pinned at the neck by a white Minneapolis police officer. As more beaches, churches, mosques, schools and businesses reopened worldwide, the sudden and mass civil unrest in the United States is raising fears of new virus outbreaks in a country that has more confirmed infections and deaths than any other. And it’s not just in the U.S. — London hosted a large anti-racism protest Sunday where demonstrators violated social distancing rules. Rosa Jimenez Cano said she planned to self-quarantine for 14 days, worrying she was perhaps “irresponsible” when she attended Saturday night's protest in Miami, where she exposed herself to crowds of people. Protests over Floyd's death — the latest in a series of killings of black men and women at the hands of police in America — have shaken the country from Minneapolis to New York, from Atlanta to Los Angeles. Some turned into riots and clashes with police, leaving stores in flames and torched cars in the streets. Health experts fear that silent carriers of the virus could unwittingly infect others at protests where people are packed cheek to jowl, many without masks, many chanting, singing or shouting. The virus is dispersed by microscopic droplets in the air when people cough, sneeze, sing or talk. “There’s no question that, when you put hundreds or thousands of people together in close proximity, when we have got this virus all over the streets ... it’s not healthy,"" Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan said Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union.” ""Two weeks from now across America, we’re going to find out whether or not this gives us a spike and drives the numbers back up again or not.” The U.S. has seen over 1.7 million infections and nearly 104,000 deaths in the pandemic, which has disproportionately affected racial minorities in a nation that does not have universal health care. Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser said Sunday she was very concerned that the protests in the nation’s capital and elsewhere could provide fertile ground for a new series of outbreaks. Many of the protesters were wearing masks, but there were no attempts at social distancing. “We’ve been working very hard in these last eight to 10 weeks to not have any mass gatherings,” she said. “As a nation, we have to be concerned about a rebound.” Even the many protesters wearing masks are not guaranteed protection. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says cloth masks keep infected people from spreading the virus but are not designed to protect wearers from getting it. Mass protests in connection with Floyd’s death were also being held in Europe. In London, thousands of people marched Sunday chanting “No justice! No peace!” while carrying signs reading “Justice for George Floyd” and “Racism is a global issue.” Many demonstrators were not wearing masks and most in the crowd at Trafalgar Square were packed closely together. Britain has seen nearly 38,500 virus deaths, the second-highest in the world after the United States. In Berlin, hundreds of protesters picketed outside the U.S. Embassy on Saturday night under the motto: “Justice for George Floyd.” Others marched near the U.S. embassy in Copenhagen, Denmark. Many Americans returned Sunday to in-person church services for the first time in weeks and tens of thousands of mosques reopened across the Middle East, but countries from India to Colombia still saw rising numbers of new infections. Nearly 6.1 million infections have been reported worldwide, with nearly 370,000 people dying, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. The true death toll is believed to be significantly higher, since many victims died of the virus without ever being tested. The situation worsened Sunday in India, where new daily cases topped 8,000 for the first time and 193 more deaths were reported. Despite that, India still is easing restrictions on shops and public transport in more states beginning Monday, although subways and schools will remain closed. In Saudi Arabia, mosques reopened Sunday for the first time in more than two months, but Islam’s holiest site in Mecca remained closed. In Jerusalem, throngs of worshippers waited outside the Al-Aqsa Mosque before it reopened. Many wore surgical masks and waited for temperature checks as they entered. In Bogota, the capital of Colombia, authorities were locking down an area of nearly 1.5 million people as cases continued to rise. Mayor Claudia Lopez said no one in the working-class Kennedy area — inaugurated by the late U.S. President John F. Kennedy in 1961 — will be allowed out, except to seek food or medical care or in case of an emergency. Factories must also close. In Spain, Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez said Sunday that he would ask Parliament for a final two-week extension of the nation’s state of emergency that is set to expire on June 7. That allows the government to keep ordering lockdown measures to control its coronavirus outbreak, which has claimed at least 27,000 lives, many of them in overwhelmed nursing homes. “We have almost reached safe harbor,” Sánchez said. At the Vatican, Pope Francis cautioned people against being pessimistic as they emerge from coronavirus lockdowns. During Mass in St. Peter’s Basilica to mark Pentecost Sunday, Francis noted a tendency to say that “nothing will return as before.” That kind of thinking, Francis said, guarantees that “the one thing that certainly does not return is hope.” ___ Kirka reported from London and Gorondi reported from Budapest.

Police move towards a protester after curfew Saturday, May 30, 2020, in Minneapolis. Protests continued following the death of George Floyd, who died after being restrained by Minneapolis police officers on Memorial Day. (Source: AP Photo/John Minchillo) City and state officials deployed thousands of National Guard soldiers, enacted strict curfews and shut down mass transit systems to slow protesters' movements, but that did little to stop parts of many cities from again erupting into mayhem. Protesters in Philadelphia hurled rocks and Molotov cocktails at police, officials said, while thieves in more than 20 California cities smashed their way into businesses and ran off with as much as they could carry — boxes of sneakers, armloads of clothes, and cellphones, TVs and other electronics. In Minneapolis, a tanker truck driver drove into a massive crowd of demonstrators nearly a week after the death of George Floyd, a black man who pleaded for air as an officer pressed a knee into his neck. No protesters appeared to be injured, and the driver was arrested. Tensions spiked outside the White House, the scene of three days of demonstrations, where police fired tear gas and stun grenades into a crowd of more than 1,000 chanting protesters across the street in Lafayette Park. The crowd ran away and piled up road signs and plastic barriers to light a raging fire in a nearby street. Some pulled an American flag from a building and threw it into the blaze. A building in the park with bathrooms and a maintenance office went up in flames and people broke into banks and jewelry stores. As demonstrations persisted past curfew, Washington police said they were responding to multiple fires set around the capital. The entire Washington, D.C., National Guard — roughly 1,700 soldiers — was called in to help control the protests, according to two Defense Department officials who insisted on anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the matter. As the protests grew, President Donald Trump retweeted conservative commentator Buck Sexton who called for ""overwhelming force"" against violent demonstrators. Secret Service agents had rushed Trump to a White House bunker on Friday night as hundreds of protesters gathered outside the executive mansion, some of them throwing rocks and tugging at police barricades. The president spent nearly an hour in the bunker designed for use in emergencies like terrorist attacks, according to a Republican close to the White House who was not authorized to publicly discuss private matters and spoke on condition of anonymity. The account was confirmed by an administration official who also spoke on condition of anonymity. Former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, visited the site of protests in his hometown of Wilmington, Delaware, and talked to some of the demonstrators. He also wrote a post on Medium expressing empathy for those despairing about the killing of George Floyd. At least 4,400 people have been arrested over days of protests, according to a tally compiled by The Associated Press. Arrests ranged from stealing and blocking highways to breaking curfew. In Salt Lake City, an activist leader condemned the destruction of property but said broken buildings shouldn't be mourned on the same level as black men like Floyd. ""Maybe this country will get the memo that we are sick of police murdering unarmed black men,"" said Lex Scott, founder of Black Lives Matter Utah. ""Maybe the next time a white police officer decides to pull the trigger, he will picture cities burning."" Yet thousands still marched peacefully in Phoenix, Albuquerque and other cities, with some calling for an end to the fires, vandalism and theft, saying it weakened calls for justice and reform. ""They keep killing our people,"" said Mahira Louis, 15, who marched with her mother and several hundred others in a peaceful protest through downtown Boston. ""I'm so sick and tired of it."" But as night fell that demonstration also descended into violence, with some protesters throwing rocks, bricks and glass bottles at officers and lighting a police vehicle on fire. In downtown Atlanta, authorities fired tear gas to disperse hundreds of demonstrators. Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said two officers had been fired and three placed on desk duty after video showed police surrounding a car Saturday, then pulling a woman out of the passenger seat and appearing to use a stun gun on a man who was driving. Police Chief Erika Shields called it ""really shocking to watch."" In downtown Los Angeles, a police SUV accelerated into several protesters in a street, knocking two people to the ground. The pair got up and ran onto the sidewalk. Nearby in Santa Monica, not far from a peaceful demonstration, a group broke into a Gap and a Vans sneaker store, where people walked out with boxes of shoes. Others shattered the windows of an REI outdoor supply store and snatched folding chairs, a bike and backpacks. A fire broke out at a restaurant across the street. About 30 miles (48 kilometers) south, as hundreds of protesters gathered in Long Beach, scores of thieves swarmed into nearby outlet stores. A steady stream emerged from a Forever 21 store carrying armloads of clothing. Some hauled it away in garbage bags, and a few stopped outside to change into stolen items. In Minneapolis, the officer who pressed his knee onto Floyd's neck has been charged with murder, but protesters are demanding the other three officers at the scene be prosecuted. All four were fired. ""We're not done,"" said Darnella Wade, an organizer for Black Lives Matter in neighboring St. Paul, where thousands gathered peacefully in front of the state Capitol as state patrolmen and National Guard soldiers lined up in front of about a dozen military-style armored vehicles. ""They sent us the military, and we only asked them for arrests."" Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz brought in thousands of National Guard soldiers on Saturday to help quell violence that had damaged or destroyed hundreds of buildings in Minneapolis over days of protests. That appeared to help minimize unrest both Saturday and Sunday. Disgust over generations of racism in a country founded by slaveholders combined with a string of recent racially charged killings to stoke the anger. Adding to that was angst from months of lockdowns brought on by the coronavirus pandemic, which has disproportionately hurt communities of color, not only in terms of infections but in job losses and economic stress. The droves of people congregating for demonstrations threatened to trigger new outbreaks, a fact overshadowed by the boiling tensions. The scale of the coast-to-coast protests rivaled the historic demonstrations of the civil rights and Vietnam War eras. Curfews were imposed in major cities around the U.S., including Atlanta, Chicago, Denver, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Seattle. About 5,000 National Guard soldiers and airmen were activated in 15 states and Washington, D.C. In Indianapolis, two people were reported dead in bursts of downtown violence this weekend, adding to deaths reported in Detroit and Minneapolis in recent days. In tweets Sunday, Trump blamed anarchists and the media for fueling violence. Attorney General William Barr pointed a finger at ""far left extremist"" groups. Police chiefs and politicians accused outsiders of coming in and causing the problems. At the Minneapolis intersection where Floyd was killed, people gathered with brooms and flowers, saying it was important to protect what they called a ""sacred space."" Among in Minneapolis was Michael Brown Sr., the father of Michael Brown, whose killing by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, set off unrest in 2014. ""I understand what this family is feeling. I understand what this community is feeling,"" he said. ___ Morrison and Sullivan reported from Minneapolis.

Fargo Mayor Tim Mahoney and Moorhead Mayor Johnathan Judd said the protesters’ voices were heard and promised to work to address their concerns, but pleaded for a peaceful dialogue to confront what Judd called “institutional racism” that lies at the heart of the grievances that transformed downtown Fargo into a riot scene the night of Saturday, May 30. Fargo Police Chief David Todd said officers who were working in the crowd under cover during Saturday’s march to honor George Floyd, a Minneapolis man who died in police custody, heard some of the protesters discussing their plans to cause trouble. “They were traveling from city to city to do specifically this, to cause mayhem and confusion,” Todd said, adding that some other protesters might have been drawn into violent actions that started with hurling rocks and water bottles at police and escalated over a period of hours into looting. listen live watch live Downtown businesses that were broken into included JL Beers and nearby Gate City Bank and the Exchange Building in the heart of downtown, where a tense standoff between police in riot gear and the crowd erupted into confrontation. Looters stole furniture and other items from JL Beers and broke into Gate City Bank, but did not succeed in stealing any money, Todd said. Gov. Doug Burgum activated the North Dakota National Guard, many of whom were training over the weekend, to assist law enforcement. The Guard was deployed around 9 p.m., Burgum said, and stood ready to protect firefighters if any fires were started. Police arrested 10 demonstrators for inciting a riot and preventing arrest. Four officers needed medical attention, including two for concussions from objects thrown two for heat exhaustion and dehydration, Todd said. Two demonstrators received medical attention, including one for a gash on an arm, he said. There were no serious injuries and no severe property damage, officials said, although eight police squad cars were damaged. Police will be reviewing video of the march and downtown confrontation and more arrests are possible, Todd said. Saturday morning, a demonstration began at Island Park near downtown and then marchers walked 20 blocks to Fargo police headquarters, where a tense situation appeared to have been defused when Judd and Mahoney walked into the crowd and spoke with some of the protesters. Todd and some of his officers joined the dialogue and the police chief even posed for photographs with a few march participants — a conciliatory calm that later unraveled. Cass County Sheriff Jesse Jahner said some of the marchers were hurling rocks and bottles at police officers along the route. A turning point came in the evening when some demonstrators surrounded two Fargo police officers in a squad car and threw rocks and bottles at them, threatening their safety, Todd said. Other officers were able to rescue the two, but the situation deteriorated further as the evening continued. Police used teargas downtown around 8 p.m. when protesters did not disperse despite police orders. Mahoney on Sunday morning lifted a curfew he had imposed Saturday night and said he hopes there will be no further demonstrations as the city works to rebuild and heal. “The heart and soul of our community … that’s our focus now,” he said. Early Sunday morning, merchants and volunteers were out sweeping the streets and cleaning debris, a display of the community’s resolve and resiliency, the mayor said. “Last night’s actions do not define this community and its people,” he said. He urged people to come together to peacefully resolve grievances. “We need to hear each other, we need to be tolerant, we need to care about each other,” Mahoney said. Jahner, who said the majority of the protesters were peaceful, struck a firmer note when he vowed: “Law enforcement will succeed in regaining control.” North Dakota respects and honors peoples’ right to free speech and assembly, Burgum said. He said officials want to send a message valuing “justice and humanity” and pledged to join together to resolve issues. “It’s lost when it moves from a peaceful protest to what I think can only be described as an organized riot,” Burgum said. “If you want to have a dialogue in North Dakota, all you have to do is ask.” Judd, who said he had little sleep over the past four days, delivered an eloquent appeal to deal with the root causes underlying the frustrations that boiled over Saturday. “We honestly need to have a very serious conversation about race in this country,” he said, including a “candid conversation about institutional racism.” He added, for emphasis, “It’s time, folks.” Judd praised the Fargo Police Department, which he said acted in an “extremely professional capacity,” displaying patience before they took firm action. “They acted with integrity,” he said. For those who turned out to protest, Judd said, “We heard you. We need in this community to listen with humility. We don’t have all the answers individually, but collectively we can make a difference in this community and we will.” Watch a replay of the livestream below.",0.0

Some volunteers coughed because of the lingering chemical agents and many others cried as they swept up broken glass and collected spent rubber bullets and empty tear gas canisters. The Exchange building, JL Beers, Vinyl Taco, Gate City Bank, Hotel Donaldson, The Forum and River City Church all were damaged with rocks or by spray paint. “Don’t do this to your city, man,” said longtime Fargo resident Robb Walvatne as he helped pick up debris. “There were sirens all night long. Listen to that man, we’re 200 miles away from Minneapolis. What is going on in Fargo? Fargo. This is the saddest thing I’ve seen, and I can’t understand what is going on."" “You don’t ruin your city,” Walvatne said. listen live watch live Chris Wooten, born and bred in Fargo, joined more than two dozen volunteers in helping clean up the damage mostly on First Avenue North, just east of Broadway. “This place has always been my home. I think this was a complete overreaction,” Wooten said, expressing anger and sadness about what happened the night before. He bent down in the street to pick up a pair of pinkish sunglasses. “See? The protesters were destroying themselves.” While shoveling broken glass outside of HoDo, Dan Farnsworth said watching the destruction broke his heart. ""I had trouble sleeping last night after all that happened,” he said. Fargo Mayor Tim Mahoney said during a news conference Sunday it was time not for retaliation, but for rebuilding. “We know we are shocked and you are angry. Last night’s action doesn’t define (Fargo's) people,” Mahoney said. Moorhead Mayor Jonathan Judd also spoke with reporters at the news conference. ""The reason why we're here today is because of George Floyd, and this incident has set off a lot of emotions across the country. I would like to extend condolences,"" Judd said. ""It's hard for me to find the words to express my feelings ... this has been an emotional roller coaster not only for myself, but for individuals I am close to."" George Floyd's death and Saturday's unrest are a wake-up call for Americans, Judd added. ""We need to have a candid conversation about racism in this country ... It's time folks,"" he said.

""There were a lot of good people. When they reached the police department, it was tense at times … but we had a really good reaction.” But after demonstrators met police at the new Fargo police headquarters on 25th Street North, the march continued on streets that were not part of the original route. The Fargo Police Department didn’t stop the march, which had about 2,000 people, because of the violence that is occurring in other cities across the United States, Todd said. “We wanted to let people march and keep people safe,"" he said. Police learned of plans to loot and burn downtown from social media, Todd continued. “We started to see more aggression toward our officers.” In total, 18 people were arrested with 10 people charged with Class A misdemeanor inciting a riot. Four officers needed medical attention, with two police officers suffering concussions after getting hit by rocks, Todd said. “We’re Fargo strong, we’re going to bounce back,"" Todd said. ""I am still interested in having a dialogue with the good people of that march and affecting positive change.” North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum walked through downtown and felt inspired by the volunteers cleaning up, he said during the press conference. “The important message that began yesterday morning about justice and humanity and important aspirations for us to come together … it’s lost when it moves from the peaceful protest to what I think can only be characterized as an organized riot,” Burgum said. “It’s clear that there were people that arrived last night not for dialogue, not for progress, but for violence and vandalism,” the governor added. “As we saw from the two mayors yesterday walking into the crowd … if you want to have a dialogue in North Dakota all you have to do is ask. We stand ready to meet with anyone.” Multiple police departments, the Cass County Sheriff’s Office, the North Dakota National Guard, undercover agents, and other agencies were deployed to the riot, Mahoney said. Alan Kasin, a co-owner of Pounds, a bar and restaurant on First Avenue North, was filling a tin tub with ice and water bottles on the sidewalk as the cleanup progressed. Backhoes rumbled back and forth from glass, rock and dirt piles. Fearing for the safety of his staff, he closed his restaurant early Saturday, during the earlier stages of the riot, he said. “We had to shut down pretty quickly — had to get staff out safely,” Kasin said. “All of this stuff is replaceable.” He attended the rally, called Fargo Marches for George Floyd, earlier in the day, and called it inspiring. “I thought it was pretty emotional. It was everything you would want to see as far as a peaceful assembly,” Kasin said. Before he left his business Saturday he saw some people trying to calm protesters down. “You could feel the crowd’s agitation, but at some point, there weren’t enough voices to keep it calm,” he said. “Is this what America is about?” One volunteer woman said out loud while pushing a broom. Andrew Buck, a longtime Fargo resident, said he joined the protest early on Saturday, and also later when the riot began. He tried to keep people quiet, and at one point was taken into police custody, but released, he said. A tear gas canister flew past his head as well, he said. Buck joined other volunteers to help clean up because Fargo is his home. “We had 16 hours of protesting and it took 45 minutes to clean it up,” he said. Erika Kraft, a night nurse at Essentia Health, just got off her shift and headed to downtown to help clean up. “Part of me is saddened. Some of the money it will take to repair everything could have gone to people who need food and shelter,” Kraft said. Earlier Sunday, Mahoney stopped by the cleanup process, saying he was headed to City Hall to work on assessing the damage. “It was crazy last night, I was very upset,” Mahoney said. “But I’m also just overwhelmed right now as the citizens are already cleaning up the streets. I couldn’t be happier or prouder of the citizens. They want their city back.”",0.0

Meanwhile, the organizers of Saturday’s peaceful protest and especially all levels of law enforcement deserve our admiration. The organizers worked with law enforcement to plan a peaceful assembly and a forum to exercise their free speech rights until 6 pm. The event was taken over by about 30 to 40 organizers from outside the area, and when things turned violent the organizers of the peaceful assembly all denounced the turn to violence and participated in none of it. Law enforcement uniformly acted with great judgment and restraint, depriving the outsiders of the violent confrontation they sought. They will not be back, more surely than if they had gotten what they wanted. I hope law enforcement will identify the outsiders, and especially who organized them and paid their way to Fargo.",0.0

President Donald Trump listens during a meeting about the coronavirus response with Gov. Phil Murphy, D-N.J., in the Oval Office of the White House, Thursday, April 30, 2020, in Washington. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci) Antifa, short for anti-fascists, is an umbrella term for far-left-leaning militant groups that resist neo-Nazis and white supremacists at demonstrations. “The United States of America will be designating ANTIFA as a Terrorist Organization,” Trump tweeted around noon on Sunday. As protests over the death of George Floyd grow in cities across the U.S., government officials have been warning of the “outsiders” -- groups of organized rioters they say are flooding into major cities not to call for justice but to cause destruction. But the state and federal officials have offered differing assessments of who the outsiders are. They’ve blamed left-wing extremists, far-right white nationalists and even suggested the involvement of drug cartels. These leaders have offered little evidence to back up those claims, and the chaos of the protests makes verifying identities and motives exceedingly difficult. The finger pointing on both sides of the political spectrum is likely to deepen the political divide in the U.S., allowing politicians to advance the theory that aligns with their political view and distract from the underlying frustrations that triggered the protests. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz on Saturday told reporters he’d heard unconfirmed reports that white supremacists were coming from elsewhere to stoke the violence and that even drug cartels “are trying to take advantage of the chaos.” John Harrington, the state’s commissioner of public safety, later said they had received intel reports on white supremacists. “But I cannot say that we have confirmed observations of local law enforcement to say that we’ve seen cells of white supremacists in the area,” he said Saturday. But federal officials later pointed to “far left extremist groups."" President Donald Trump alleged the violence was “being led by Antifa and other radical groups.” Attorney General William Barr later seemed to echo Trump's assertion, saying the violent incidents in Minneapolis were driven by groups using ""Antifa-like tactics."" Barr vowed that federal prosecutors across the country would use federal riots statutes to charge protesters who cross state lines to participate in violent rioting. A Justice Department spokesperson said the attorney general’s assertion was based on information provided from state and local law enforcement agencies, but did not detail what that information entailed. Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf was even more vague, declining to point to any particular ideology in his assessment. His agency has heard that “a number of different groups are involved in these whether it’s Antifa or it’s others, frankly,"" he said. The groups appeared to be organized and using tactics that wouldn’t normally happen in peaceful protest, he said, though he didn’t elaborate. While the motives behind the violence were unclear, there was firmer evidence that some of the protesters were coming to the demonstrations from outside the urban centers that have been the epicenter of the demonstrations. In New York City, federal officials were bringing charges against several suspects, including one of two sisters from upstate New York accused of throwing a Molotov cocktail through the back window of a police van in Brooklyn, a law enforcement official said. The initially peaceful demonstrations in New York City over Floyd’s death spiraled into chaos as night fell Friday. Protesters confronted police officers, destroying police vehicles and setting fires. In Detroit, 37 of the 60 people who were arrested in overnight protests did not live in the city — and many came from nearby suburbs, police Chief James Craig said Saturday. Although Detroit is about 80% black, many of those arrested were white. “We support the right to free speech. We support peaceful protests,” Craig told reporters. “If you want to disrupt, stay home and disrupt in your own community.” Initially, St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter said he’d been told all of those arrested in his city Friday were from outside the state. But a spokesman said Saturday night the mayor had later learned more than half are from Minnesota. In Hennepin County, which includes Minneapolis, 47 of the 57 people arrested in protest incidents through Saturday morning had provided a Minnesota address to authorities, according to Jeremy Zoss, a spokesman for the Hennepin County Sheriff’s Office. Carter expressed the opinion of many black activists in the Twin Cities who have expressed disbelief that local residents would destroy their own neighborhoods, burning down essential services and damaging small businesses. And while it was local protesters and groups that staged initial angry, but peaceful, demonstrations, it was agitators from elsewhere that strategically escalated the tension by causing damage and setting fires, they said. Their beliefs were reinforced by the large numbers of white people in the protests in Minneapolis. “I think about a third of the people are from out of town here to make the city burn,” said Justin Terrell, executive director of the Council for Minnesotans of African Heritage. “It is just putting black people in a crossfire not just between fascists and anarchists -- but putting us in a crossfire with the national guard.” It’s exceedingly difficult in the chaos and dark of the events to prove these claims. The challenge is made harder in the Minnesota protest, where very few arrests were made in the first two nights of unrest. St. Paul arrest records showed 18 people were arrested on charges related to civil unrest from Thursday to early Saturday morning. Of those, only four were from outside the state; two were listed as unknown. Still, some civil rights leaders had a clear message for anyone coming to protest, even those who show up to call for justice for Floyd. “The moment has passed. Go home, stay away from here. We are a vulnerable population. At the end of that day if black folks can’t rebuild then the only thing we’ve done is build more power for white folks,"" said Terrell. ""You’re talking about years, decades of work undone by these groups -- and by the officer.” Trump vowed Saturday that the “radical left criminals, thugs and others” would “not be allowed to set communities ablaze.” “I will not allow angry mobs to dominate,” he said. “Won’t happen.” Copyright 2020 Associated Press.

This is hard!” he exclaimed as he put his entire body into scrubbing graffiti off of a concrete parking structure at Gate City Bank. The women scrubbing next to him giggled at his dramatic tone. Adonnis came downtown early Sunday morning with his father, Patrick Williams, a Fargo firefighter. “I brought my son down here to teach him a lesson that no matter what’s going on that unity gets more done than division,” he said. listen live watch live Williams is a native of Gary, Indiana, but made Fargo-Moorhead his home after receiving a football scholarship at Minnesota State University Moorhead a few years back. “This just seemed like a nice place to settle, a nice place to build a family,” he said Williams has two other younger children, a two-year-old son and a five-month-old daughter, but he said Adonnis is the only one old enough to perhaps take something away from the experience. “I wanted to show him what can happen if you let emotions take control of you and you don’t use logic. There’s still a mess to be cleaned up,” Williams said. The Williams were two of a few hundred people who showed up Sunday morning, May 31, to assist in the riot cleanup - which included glass on the sidewalks and streets as well as graffiti spray painted on buildings. A staging area for volunteers was set up outside of the Pounds restaurant, where volunteers could pick up donated cleaning supplies and water bottles. There was such an outpouring of volunteers that by 10 a.m., the Fargo Police were becoming concerned about public safety, including accidents and a lack of social distancing with the COVID-19 pandemic. Volunteers were asked to finish up whatever they were working on and head home. Adonnis kept scrubbing, but was also intent on getting his dad fed. When the Williams and other volunteers were done scrubbing the graffiti of the Gate City structure, it was a vast improvement from when they started and a positive Sunday morning father-son outing. “I just thought this would be a good life lesson for him and that it would be something he could take further into his life and make him a more productive member of society,” Williams says.

He urged people to come together to peacefully resolve grievances. “We need to hear each other, we need to be tolerant, we need to care about each other,” Mahoney said. Jahner, who said the majority of the protesters were peaceful, struck a firmer note when he vowed: “Law enforcement will succeed in regaining control.” North Dakota respects and honors peoples’ right to free speech and assembly, Burgum said. He said officials want to send a message valuing “justice and humanity” and pledged to join together to resolve issues. “It’s lost when it moves from a peaceful protest to what I think can only be described as an organized riot,” Burgum said. “If you want to have a dialogue in North Dakota, all you have to do is ask.” Judd, who said he had little sleep over the past four days, delivered an eloquent appeal to deal with the root causes underlying the frustrations that boiled over Saturday. “We honestly need to have a very serious conversation about race in this country,” he said, including a “candid conversation about institutional racism.” He added, for emphasis, “It’s time, folks.” Judd praised the Fargo Police Department, which he said acted in an “extremely professional capacity,” displaying patience before they took firm action. “They acted with integrity,” he said. For those who turned out to protest, Judd said, “We heard you. We need in this community to listen with humility. We don’t have all the answers individually, but collectively we can make a difference in this community and we will.” Watch a replay of the livestream below.",0.0

People, some of them kneeling gather in Trafalgar Square in central London on Sunday, May 31, 2020 to protest against the recent killing of George Floyd by police officers in Minneapolis that has led to protests across the US. (AP Photo/Matt Dunham) Racism-tinged events no longer startle even America's closest allies, though many have watched coverage of the often-violent protests with growing unease. Burning cars and riot police in the U.S. featured on newspaper front pages around the globe Sunday — bumping news of the COVID-19 pandemic to second-tier status in some places. Floyd's death on May 25 in Minneapolis was the latest in a series of deaths of black men and women at the hands of police in the U.S. Thousands gathered in central London on Sunday to offer support for American demonstrators. Chanting ""No justice! No peace!"" and waving placards with the words ""How many more?"" at Trafalgar Square, the protesters ignored U.K. government rules banning crowds because of the pandemic. Police didn't stop them. Demonstrators then marched to the U.S. Embassy, where a long line of officers surrounded the building. Several hundred milled around in the street and waved placards. Protesters in Denmark also converged on the U.S. Embassy on Sunday. Participants carried placards with messages such as ""Stop Killing Black People."" The U.S. Embassy in Berlin was the scene of protests on Saturday under the motto: ""Justice for George Floyd."" Several hundred more people took to the streets Sunday in the capital's Kreuzberg area, carrying signs with slogans like ""Silence is Violence,"" ""Hold Cops Accountable,"" and ""Who Do You Call When Police Murder?"" No incidents were reported. Germany's top-selling Bild newspaper on Sunday carried the sensational headline ""This killer-cop set America ablaze"" with an arrow pointing to a photo of now-fired police officer Derek Chauvin, who has been charged with third-degree murder in Floyd's death, with his knee on Floyd's neck. The newspaper's story reported ""scenes like out of a civil war."" In Italy, the Corriere della Sera newspaper's senior U.S. correspondent Massimo Gaggi wrote that the reaction to Floyd's killing was ""different"" than previous cases of black Americans killed by police and the ensuring violence. ""There are exasperated black movements that no longer preach nonviolent resistance,"" Gaggi wrote, noting the Minnesota governor's warning that ""anarchist and white supremacy groups are trying to fuel the chaos.'' In countries with authoritarian governments, state-controlled media have been highlighting the chaos and violence of the U.S. demonstrations, in part to undermine American officials' criticism of their own nations. In China, the protests are being viewed through the prism of U.S. government criticism of China's crackdown on anti-government protests in Hong Kong. Hu Xijin, the editor of the state-owned Global Times newspaper, tweeted that U.S. officials can now see protests out their own windows: ""I want to ask Speaker Pelosi and Secretary Pompeo: Should Beijing support protests in the U.S., like you glorified rioters in Hong Kong?"" Hua Chunying, a Chinese Foreign ministry spokeswoman, pointed out America's racial unrest by tweeting ""I can't breathe,"" which Floyd said before his death. In Iran, which has violently put down nationwide demonstrations by killing hundreds, arresting thousands and disrupting internet access to the outside world, state television has repeatedly aired images of the U.S. unrest. One TV anchor discussed ""a horrible scene from New York, where police attacked protesters."" Another state TV message accused U.S. police agencies in Washington of ""setting fire to cars and attacking protesters,"" without offering any evidence. Russia accused the United States of ""systemic problems in the human rights sphere.'' It denounced Floyd's death as the latest in a series of police violence cases against African Americans. ""This incident is far from the first in a series of lawless conduct and unjustified violence from U.S. law enforcement,'' the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement. ""American police commit such high-profile crimes all too often.'' There also have been expressions of solidarity with the demonstrators. In Brazil, hundreds of people gathered in front of the Rio de Janeiro state government palace to protest crimes committed by the police against black people in Rio's working-class neighborhoods, known as favelas. The protest, called ""Black lives matter,"" was interrupted when police used tear gas to disperse people. ""I can't breathe"", said some of the demonstrators, alluding to the George Floyd´s death. Protesters called for an end to police operations inside favelas. In Canada, an anti-racism protest degenerated into clashes between Montreal police and some demonstrators. About three hours after a march that snaked its way through downtown Montreal had ended, police declared the gathering illegal after they say projectiles were thrown at officers who responded with pepper spray and tear gas. Some windows were smashed and some fires were set. Over the weekend, Lebanese anti-government protesters flooded social media with tweets sympathetic to U.S. protesters, using the hashtag #Americarevolts. That's a play on the slogan for Lebanon's protest movement — Lebanon revolts — which erupted on Oct. 17 last year. Within 24 hours, the hashtag #Americanrevolts became the No. 1 trending tag in Lebanon. In another expression of solidarity with American protesters, about 150 people marched through central Jerusalem on Saturday to protest the shooting death by Israeli police of an unarmed, autistic Palestinian man earlier in the day. Israeli police mistakenly suspected that the man, Iyad Halak, was carrying a weapon. When he failed to obey orders to stop, officers opened fire. ___ Associated Press Writers David Rising in Berlin, Jon Gambrell in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, Frances D'Emilio in Rome, Zeina Karam in Beirut, Tia Goldenberg in Jerusalem, Ken Moritsugu in Beijing, Jari Tanner in Helsinki, Finland, and Jim Heintz in Moscow, contributed to this report. ___ Follow the AP’s latest news about the protests in the U.S. at https://apnews.com/GeorgeFloyd Copyright 2020 Associated Press.

Some volunteers coughed because of the lingering chemical agents and many others cried as they swept up broken glass and collected spent rubber bullets and empty tear gas canisters. The Exchange building, JL Beers, Vinyl Taco, Gate City Bank, Hotel Donaldson, The Forum and River City Church all were damaged with rocks or by spray paint. “Don’t do this to your city, man,” said longtime Fargo resident Robb Walvatne as he helped pick up debris. “There were sirens all night long.

The protesters were destroying themselves.” While shoveling broken glass outside of HoDo, Dan Farnsworth said watching the destruction broke his heart. ""I had trouble sleeping last night after all that happened,” he said. Fargo Mayor Tim Mahoney said during a news conference Sunday, May 31, it was time not for retaliation, but for rebuilding. “We know we are shocked and you are angry. Last night’s action doesn’t define (Fargo's) people,” Mahoney said. Moorhead Mayor Jonathan Judd also spoke with reporters at the news conference. ""The reason why we're here today is because of George Floyd, and this incident has set off a lot of emotions across the country. I would like to extend condolences,"" Judd said. ""It's hard for me to find the words to express my feelings ... this has been an emotional roller coaster not only for myself, but for individuals I am close to."" George Floyd's death and Saturday's unrest are a wake-up call for Americans, Judd added. ""We need to have a candid conversation about racism in this country ... It's time folks,"" he said. The violence in downtown Fargo came from about 40 to 50 outside agitators, said Fargo Police Chief David Todd, who thanked Mahoney and Judd for defusing potential violence earlier in the day on Saturday. “You could see some hostility in that march, but you could see good people, too,"" Todd said. ""There were a lot of good people. When they reached the police department, it was tense at times … but we had a really good reaction.” But after demonstrators met police at the new Fargo police headquarters on 25th Street North, the march continued on streets that were not part of the original route. The Fargo Police Department didn’t stop the march, which had about 2,000 people, because of the violence that is occurring in other cities across the United States, Todd said. “We wanted to let people march and keep people safe,"" he said. Police learned of plans to loot and burn downtown from social media, Todd continued. “We started to see more aggression toward our officers.” In total, 18 people were arrested with 10 people charged with Class A misdemeanor inciting a riot. Four officers needed medical attention, with two police officers suffering concussions after getting hit by rocks, Todd said. “We’re Fargo strong, we’re going to bounce back,"" Todd said. ""I am still interested in having a dialogue with the good people of that march and affecting positive change.” North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum walked through downtown and felt inspired by the volunteers cleaning up, he said during the press conference. “The important message that began yesterday morning about justice and humanity and important aspirations for us to come together … it’s lost when it moves from the peaceful protest to what I think can only be characterized as an organized riot,” Burgum said. “It’s clear that there were people that arrived last night not for dialogue, not for progress, but for violence and vandalism,” the governor added. “As we saw from the two mayors yesterday walking into the crowd … if you want to have a dialogue in North Dakota all you have to do is ask. We stand ready to meet with anyone.” Multiple police departments, the Cass County Sheriff’s Office, the North Dakota National Guard, undercover agents, and other agencies were deployed to the riot, Mahoney said. Alan Kasin, a co-owner of Pounds, a bar and restaurant on First Avenue North, was filling a tin tub with ice and water bottles on the sidewalk as the cleanup progressed. Backhoes rumbled back and forth from glass, rock and dirt piles. Fearing for the safety of his staff, he closed his restaurant early Saturday, during the earlier stages of the riot, he said. “We had to shut down pretty quickly — had to get staff out safely,” Kasin said. “All of this stuff is replaceable.” He attended the rally, called Fargo Marches for George Floyd, earlier in the day, and called it inspiring. “I thought it was pretty emotional. It was everything you would want to see as far as a peaceful assembly,” Kasin said. Before he left his business Saturday, May 30, he saw some people trying to calm protesters down. “You could feel the crowd’s agitation, but at some point, there weren’t enough voices to keep it calm,” he said. “Is this what America is about?” One volunteer woman said out loud while pushing a broom. Andrew Buck, a longtime Fargo resident, said he joined the protest early on Saturday, and also later when the riot began. He tried to keep people quiet, and at one point was taken into police custody, but released, he said. A tear gas canister flew past his head as well, he said. Buck joined other volunteers to help clean up because Fargo is his home. “We had 16 hours of protesting and it took 45 minutes to clean it up,” he said. Erika Kraft, a night nurse at Essentia Health, just got off her shift and headed to downtown to help clean up. “Part of me is saddened. Some of the money it will take to repair everything could have gone to people who need food and shelter,” Kraft said. Earlier Sunday, Mahoney stopped by the cleanup process, saying he was headed to City Hall to work on assessing the damage. “It was crazy last night, I was very upset,” Mahoney said. “But I’m also just overwhelmed right now as the citizens are already cleaning up the streets.

But a few turned out to be rioters. People gathered early on Sunday, May 31, to sweep away the destruction from a protest the night before that turned violent in the heart of a downtown littered in the aftermath with broken glass and debris. The more difficult job, leaders acknowledged in a somber press conference, will be to address the simmering distrust and alienation that boiled over into violence as remnants of a peaceful throng turned into an angry mob. The first signs of unrest became evident the afternoon of Saturday, May 30. Demonstrators marched from Island Park near downtown to demand justice in the case of George Floyd, a Minneapolis man who died after an arresting police officer knelt on his neck for eight minutes as he pleaded for mercy. Most of the demonstrators carried signs. A few hurled rocks and water bottles at the police who lined the streets along the route, which took marchers to police headquarters in Fargo and West Fargo. listen live watch live It was an early sign of what was to come. A crowd gathered outside Fargo police headquarters and, when it became clear that unrest was possible, Moorhead Mayor Johnathan Judd turned to Fargo Mayor Tim Mahoney and said they had to intervene. A peaceful dialogue, joined by Fargo Police Chief David Todd and some of his officers, some holding signs in solidarity with the protesters, seemed to defuse the tension. Todd even posed for photographs. The trouble came Saturday evening, when demonstrators gathered downtown. A turning point came at 5:53 p.m., when a mob surrounded two Fargo police officers in a squad car at First Avenue North and Broadway, throwing rocks and bottles, badly damaging the cruiser and menacing the officers, who were rescued by fellow officers. Todd decided that there was a limit to patience, that police should try to clear lingering protesters out of downtown before darkness fell and the situation could spiral out of control. The police had stood by with restraint “for as long as we thought we could,” Todd said Sunday. But given the reports that elements within the protesters planned to “loot and burn,” the chief decided the time had come to act. “So we thought, while we’ve got daylight and we can see everybody, let’s try and start pushing everybody out of the downtown area.” Similarly, the mayors who had acted as peacemakers earlier in the day concluded that the situation was too combustible to try another round of dialogue with the now-angry crowd. “I have to be safe,” Judd said. “So my compromise was to stand on the bridge with the law enforcement officers from the state of Minnesota and their jurisdictions should anything come into Moorhead.” Around 8 p.m., police fired the first tear gas canisters to scatter the crowd, numbering perhaps 400 or 500, which Todd said was seeded with “instigators” whose mission was to egg on others to become violent — intelligence gleaned from plainclothes officers who mingled undercover with the demonstrators. “They were traveling from city to city to do specifically this, to cause mayhem and confusion,” he said, adding that some other protesters might have been drawn into joining the violence. A line of police officers formed on First Avenue North, slowly edging east toward Fifth Street, in a prolonged standoff with demonstrators that was punctuated by looting of several businesses, escalating into a riot. “That was heartbreaking last night,” Todd said at the press conference Sunday. “It was hard to watch that happen.” He added: “You could see some hostility in that march, but you could see good people, too. There were a lot of good people.” Looters stole furniture and other items from JL Beers and broke into Gate City Bank, but did not succeed in stealing any money, Todd said. Gov. Doug Burgum activated the North Dakota National Guard, many of whom were training over the weekend to assist law enforcement. The Guard was deployed at 9 p.m., Burgum said, and stood ready to protect firefighters if any fires were started. “We came through it without a fire; we came through it without any serious injuries,” the governor said. “That’s something to be said.” RELATED: Police arrested 10 demonstrators for inciting a riot and preventing arrest. Four officers needed medical attention, including two for concussions from objects thrown and two for heat exhaustion and dehydration, Todd said. Two demonstrators received medical attention, including one for a gash on an arm, he said. There was no severe property damage, officials said, although 8 police cars were damaged. Police will be reviewing video of the march and downtown confrontation and more arrests are possible, Todd said. Mahoney and Judd said the protesters’ voices were heard. They promised to work to address their concerns, but pleaded for a peaceful dialogue to address what Judd called “institutional racism” that lies at the heart of the grievances that transformed downtown Fargo into a riot scene. On Sunday morning, Mahoney lifted a curfew he had imposed Saturday night and said he hopes there will be no further demonstrations as the city works to rebuild and heal. As the day moved along Sunday police, who had been standing along intersections throughout downtown, left and it began to look like nothing had happened downtown., “The heart and soul of our community … that’s our focus now,” Mahoney said. “Last night’s actions do not define this community and its people,” he said, pointing to the swift way people came together to clean up. The mayor urged people to come together to peacefully resolve grievances. “We need to hear each other, we need to be tolerant, we need to care about each other,” Mahoney said. Cass County Sheriff Jesse Jahner said that while the majority of the protesters were peaceful, many wanted confrontation, and struck a firmer note when he vowed: “Law enforcement will succeed in regaining control.” North Dakota respects and honors people's right to free speech and assembly, Burgum said. He said officials want to send a message valuing “justice and humanity” and pledged to join together to resolve issues. “It’s lost when it moves from a peaceful protest to what I think can only be described as an organized riot,” Burgum said. “If you want to have a dialogue in North Dakota, all you have to do is ask.” Local members of Black Lives Matter, which organized the march, were on hand Sunday as workers continued to clean up downtown. “The crowds down here last night does not represent us,” John Lewis said. “It was not us,” fellow organizer Ritchell Eve Aboah said. A few troublemakers turned a peaceful protest into a riot, Lewis said. “But we can’t claim responsibility for that. I’m a student. I want to make the world a better place. We are very sad that this went down yesterday. This is our home. We’re going to clean this place up, but this is not Black Lives Matter.” Judd, who said he had little sleep over the past four days, delivered an eloquent appeal to deal with the root causes underlying the frustrations that reached a flashpoint Saturday. “We honestly need to have a very serious conversation about race in this country,” he said, including a “candid conversation about institutional racism.” He added, for emphasis, “It’s true, folks.” Judd praised the Fargo Police Department, which he said acted in an “extremely professional capacity,” for displaying patience before they took firm action. “They acted with integrity,” he said. For those who turned out to protest, Judd added: “We heard you. We need in this community to listen with humility. We don’t have all the answers individually, but collectively we can make a difference in this community, and we will.” Archie Ingersoll and Chris Flynn contributed to this report.",0.0

And today protesters gathered in Minot to show their support for the Black Lives Matter movement. Report PJ Walker there and has the details. Over 300 people showed up to Minot’s Oak Park Sunday afternoon to reflect and mourn over the life of George Floyd. “I was complaining about how I wanted to go to the cities and wasn’t able to make it. So my friend was like why don’t you do one here,” said Bre Nickelson. Bre Nickelson, who organized the Black Lives Matter protest, says the turnout for the event was far more than she expected. She says it shows that the people in the Minot community are able to come together as one. “As I’ve been saying today, we live in this very secluded community where we don’t have the experience to the rest of the country. And if people don’t pay attention they aren’t going to see what’s happening going on everywhere else,” added Nickelson. Many people at the protest had signs, displaying their thoughts, about the current issues in the world. Along with parents and their children at the event, there were also local organizations, showing that they stand behind each other and the community, in such dark times. “Being bikers, we are diverse all across the world. We come from all different areas and we come from different beliefs and different views. But what we can do is care about one another,” said Evan Hunt. The vice president of the Ice Cold Ryders Motorcycle Club says it is important for him to use his voice in the community to help encourage others as well as inform them about issues such as race. Hunt added, “Being silently complicit on things like this isn’t going to work for us. So when people speak out for people who can’t speak it gives people the strength to stand back up.” Other speakers at the event shared the same ideas. Being the voice for the voiceless, and encouraging others to take a stand for such an import issue. I believe in preventing something before it happens. I don’t like to react to situations, I like to already prevent them from happening. So it’s important that we need to stand together now if we have not. Because if we stand together now because when those outside influences try to come in and divide us, they can’t,” said one speaker, Ernest Usher. Nickelson says the knows it will take more than one protest to change things in America, but Sunday’s event was a start.

A protester runs past burning cars and buildings on Chicago Avenue, Saturday, May 30, 2020, in St. Paul, Minn. Protests continued following the death of George Floyd, who died after being restrained by Minneapolis police officers on Memorial Day. (AP Photo/John Minchillo) As demonstrations spread from Minneapolis to the White House, New York City and overseas, federal law enforcement officials insisted far-left groups were stoking violence. Meanwhile, experts who track extremist groups also reported seeing evidence of the far-right at work. Investigators were also tracking online interference and looking into whether foreign agents were behind the effort. Officials have seen a surge of social media accounts with fewer than 200 followers created in the last month, a textbook sign of a disinformation effort. The accounts have posted graphic images of the protests, material on police brutality and material on the coronavirus pandemic that appeared designed to inflame tensions across the political divide, according to three administration officials. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss investigations. The investigations are an attempt to identify the network of forces behind some of the most widespread outbreak of civil unrest in the U.S. in decades. Protests erupted in dozens of cities in recent days, triggered by the death of George Floyd, who died after he was pinned at the neck by a white Minneapolis police officer. Pandemic-weary Americans were already angry — about COVID-19 deaths, lockdown orders and tens of millions of people out of work. The pandemic has hit African Americans harder than whites in the U.S., and the killings of black people by police have continued over the years even as the topic faded from the national stage. But there are signs of people with other disparate motives, including anarchist graffiti, arrests of some out-of-state protesters, and images circulating in extremist groups that suggest the involvement of outside groups. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said Sunday that state authorities were hit with a cyber attack as law enforcement prepared to diffuse protests in Minneapolis and St. Paul, the epicenter of the unrest. “Before our operation kicked off last night, a very sophisticated denial of service attack on all computers was executed,” Walz said. “That’s not somebody sitting in their basement. That’s pretty sophisticated.” Walz did not offer details. President Donald Trump, Attorney General William Bar and others have said the left-wing extremist group antifa is to blame. Short for anti-fascists, antifa is an umbrella term for far-left-leaning militant groups that resist neo-Nazis and white supremacists at demonstrations. Barr on Sunday said the FBI would use its regional joint terrorism task forces to “identify criminal organizers,” and Trump threatened again to name antifa a terrorist group. The Justice Department is also deploying members of the U.S. Marshals Service and agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration on Sunday to supplement National Guard troops outside the White House, a senior department official said. The official was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. The addition of the federal agents, who will have armored vehicles, came as Barr warned that prosecutors could seek to use terrorism statutes against “violent radical agitators” who attempt to hijack protests to cause destruction. An antifa activist group disseminated a message in a Telegram channel on Saturday that encouraged people to consider Minnesota National Guard troops “easy targets,” two Defense Department officials said. The message encouraged activists to steal “kit,” meaning the weapons and body armor used by the soldiers. The officials were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. As a result, soldiers with the Minnesota National Guard were armed during their mission at protests across the state Sunday, the officials said. The soldiers are sometimes armed but had not been since they moved into parts of the state that had been besieged by riots in the last few days. The troops do not have the authority to make arrests, and are there to act mostly as extra security for police. Others have seen evidence of right-wing extremists. J.J. MacNab, a fellow at George Washington University’s Program on Extremism, has been monitoring chatter about the protests among anti-government extremists on social media platforms. She has access to hundreds of private Facebook groups for followers of the loosely organized “Boogaloo” movement, which uses an ’80s movie sequel as a code word for a second civil war. She also has been poring over images from the weekend protests and spotted some “boogaloo bois” in the crowds, carrying high-powered rifles and wearing tactical gear. “I think mostly they don’t want to hurt these protests. They want to co-opt them in order to start their war. They see themselves as being on the side of protesters and that the protesters themselves are useful in causing anarchy,” MacNab said. She also sees signs that the Three Percenters militia movement appears to be taking an interest. Megan Squire, an Elon University computer science professor who tracks online extremism, saw images of at least four members of the far-right Proud Boys group on the periphery of a protest Saturday night in Raleigh, North Carolina. “It’s very scattershot,” she said. “They are all talking about it, but they don’t seem to be able to translate that online fantasizing about what they’d like to do into real-world action, which is good.” Trump was expected in the coming days to draw distinctions between the legitimate anger of peaceful protesters and the unacceptable actions of violent agitators, said a White House official who was not authorized to discuss the plans ahead of time and spoke on condition of anonymity. The Trump administration has largely remained silent on local reports that far-right protesters were also involved. Meanwhile, Democratic mayors said Trump’s handling of the crisis was reminiscent of one of the darkest moments of his presidency — when he said there were “good people on both sides” of protests in 2017 over white supremacists demonstrating in Charlottesville, Virginia. America’s racial fault lines are a perfect opportunity for foreign adversaries looking to sow discord and portray the U.S. in a negative light, according to James Ludes, director of the Pell Center for International Relations and Public Policy at Salve Regina University in Rhode Island. “This is a real issue and Americans are legitimately upset about it,” said Ludes, who studies foreign disinformation tactics. “That’s one of the hallmarks of these campaigns. You don’t create new issues, you exploit existing issues.” There's a history of this. In 2016, another black man, Philando Castile, was killed by police in a Minneapolis suburb, his death livestreamed on Facebook. Russians used a fake Black Lives Matter page to confuse and stoke anger among the protesters. There were nearly 700,000 followers, but it's not clear how many were real. One debunked example from this week: That Atlanta had deployed a “child militia."" Floyd was accused of trying to pass a bad bill at a grocery store after he was laid off in the pandemic. Disturbing video showed him prone on the street, while a white police officer pressed his knee into Floyd's neck even as he cried he couldn't breathe. He later died. The officers have been fired; Derek Chauvin, the officer who pinned Floyd in the video, was charged with murder. At first there were peaceful demonstrations, but violence soon erupted. A Minneapolis police station was torched and protests took off around the country, growing increasingly tense. Video showed a police vehicle ramming into demonstrators in New York. Meanwhile, a van with four New York Police Department officers inside was hit with a Molotov cocktail and torched. Hundreds have been arrested nationwide and cities braced for more protests. But booking information from the county jail in Minneapolis, for example, showed that out of 59 protest-related arrests, 47 people had a home address in Minnesota, with the majority coming from the Twin Cities. In Washington, where protesters raged outside the White House, most of the 17 people arrested were from the area. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser said the groups seemed, at the least, organized to destroy. “They had tools to break windows and tools or a strategy to distribute materials, among them,” she said. ""The thing that we're struck by is that it was an organized group that appeared more bent on destruction on then on protest.” ___ Associated Press writers Kathleen Hennessey in Minneapolis; Michael Kunzelman in Silver Spring, Md.; Michael Biesecker in Reston, Va.; David Klepper in Providence, Rhode Island; and James LaPorta in Delray Beach, Fla., contributed to this report.

Some volunteers coughed because of the lingering chemical agents and many others cried as they swept up broken glass and collected spent rubber bullets and empty tear gas canisters. The Exchange building, JL Beers, Vinyl Taco, Gate City Bank, Hotel Donaldson, The Forum and River City Church all were damaged with rocks or by spray paint. “Don’t do this to your city, man,” said longtime Fargo resident Robb Walvatne as he helped pick up debris. “There were sirens all night long. Listen to that man, we’re 200 miles away from Minneapolis. What is going on in Fargo? Fargo. This is the saddest thing I’ve seen, and I can’t understand what is going on."" “You don’t ruin your city,” Walvatne said. listen live watch live Chris Wooten, born and bred in Fargo, joined more than two dozen volunteers in helping clean up the damage mostly on First Avenue North, just east of Broadway. “This place has always been my home. I think this was a complete overreaction,” Wooten said, expressing anger and sadness about what happened the night before. He bent down in the street to pick up a pair of pinkish sunglasses. “See? The protesters were destroying themselves.” While shoveling broken glass outside of HoDo, Dan Farnsworth said watching the destruction broke his heart. ""I had trouble sleeping last night after all that happened,” he said. Fargo Mayor Tim Mahoney said during a news conference Sunday, May 31, it was time not for retaliation, but for rebuilding. “We know we are shocked and you are angry. Last night’s action doesn’t define (Fargo's) people,” Mahoney said. Moorhead Mayor Jonathan Judd also spoke with reporters at the news conference. ""The reason why we're here today is because of George Floyd, and this incident has set off a lot of emotions across the country. I would like to extend condolences,"" Judd said. ""It's hard for me to find the words to express my feelings ... this has been an emotional roller coaster not only for myself, but for individuals I am close to."" George Floyd's death and Saturday's unrest are a wake-up call for Americans, Judd added. ""We need to have a candid conversation about racism in this country ... It's time folks,"" he said. The violence in downtown Fargo came from about 40 to 50 outside agitators, said Fargo Police Chief David Todd, who thanked Mahoney and Judd for defusing potential violence earlier in the day on Saturday. “You could see some hostility in that march, but you could see good people, too,"" Todd said. ""There were a lot of good people. When they reached the police department, it was tense at times … but we had a really good reaction.” But after demonstrators met police at the new Fargo police headquarters on 25th Street North, the march continued on streets that were not part of the original route. The Fargo Police Department didn’t stop the march, which had about 2,000 people, because of the violence that is occurring in other cities across the United States, Todd said. “We wanted to let people march and keep people safe,"" he said. Police learned of plans to loot and burn downtown from social media, Todd continued. “We started to see more aggression toward our officers.” In total, 18 people were arrested with 10 people charged with Class A misdemeanor inciting a riot. Four officers needed medical attention, with two police officers suffering concussions after getting hit by rocks, Todd said. “We’re Fargo strong, we’re going to bounce back,"" Todd said. ""I am still interested in having a dialogue with the good people of that march and affecting positive change.” North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum walked through downtown and felt inspired by the volunteers cleaning up, he said during the press conference. “The important message that began yesterday morning about justice and humanity and important aspirations for us to come together … it’s lost when it moves from the peaceful protest to what I think can only be characterized as an organized riot,” Burgum said. “It’s clear that there were people that arrived last night not for dialogue, not for progress, but for violence and vandalism,” the governor added. “As we saw from the two mayors yesterday walking into the crowd … if you want to have a dialogue in North Dakota all you have to do is ask. We stand ready to meet with anyone.” Multiple police departments, the Cass County Sheriff’s Office, the North Dakota National Guard, undercover agents, and other agencies were deployed to the riot, Mahoney said. Alan Kasin, a co-owner of Pounds, a bar and restaurant on First Avenue North, was filling a tin tub with ice and water bottles on the sidewalk as the cleanup progressed. Backhoes rumbled back and forth from glass, rock and dirt piles. Fearing for the safety of his staff, he closed his restaurant early Saturday, during the earlier stages of the riot, he said. “We had to shut down pretty quickly — had to get staff out safely,” Kasin said. “All of this stuff is replaceable.” He attended the rally, called Fargo Marches for George Floyd, earlier in the day, and called it inspiring. “I thought it was pretty emotional. It was everything you would want to see as far as a peaceful assembly,” Kasin said. Before he left his business Saturday, May 30, he saw some people trying to calm protesters down. “You could feel the crowd’s agitation, but at some point, there weren’t enough voices to keep it calm,” he said. “Is this what America is about?” One volunteer woman said out loud while pushing a broom. Andrew Buck, a longtime Fargo resident, said he joined the protest early on Saturday, and also later when the riot began. He tried to keep people quiet, and at one point was taken into police custody, but released, he said. A tear gas canister flew past his head as well, he said. Buck joined other volunteers to help clean up because Fargo is his home. “We had 16 hours of protesting and it took 45 minutes to clean it up,” he said. Erika Kraft, a night nurse at Essentia Health, just got off her shift and headed to downtown to help clean up. “Part of me is saddened. Some of the money it will take to repair everything could have gone to people who need food and shelter,” Kraft said. Earlier Sunday, Mahoney stopped by the cleanup process, saying he was headed to City Hall to work on assessing the damage. “It was crazy last night, I was very upset,” Mahoney said. “But I’m also just overwhelmed right now as the citizens are already cleaning up the streets. I couldn’t be happier or prouder of the citizens. They want their city back.”",0.0

Todd decided that there was a limit to patience, that police should try to clear lingering protesters out of downtown before darkness fell and the situation could spiral out of control. The police had stood by with restraint “for as long as we thought we could,” Todd said Sunday. But given the reports that elements within the protesters planned to “loot and burn,” the chief decided the time had come to act. “So we thought, while we’ve got daylight and we can see everybody, let’s try and start pushing everybody out of the downtown area.” Similarly, the mayors who had acted as peacemakers earlier in the day concluded that the situation was too combustible to try another round of dialogue with the now-angry crowd. “I have to be safe,” Judd said. “So my compromise was to stand on the bridge with the law enforcement officers from the state of Minnesota and their jurisdictions should anything come into Moorhead.” Around 8 p.m., police fired the first tear gas canisters to scatter the crowd, numbering perhaps 400 or 500, which Todd said was seeded with “instigators” whose mission was to egg on others to become violent — intelligence gleaned from plainclothes officers who mingled undercover with the demonstrators. “They were traveling from city to city to do specifically this, to cause mayhem and confusion,” he said, adding that some other protesters might have been drawn into joining the violence. A line of police officers formed on First Avenue North, slowly edging east toward Fifth Street, in a prolonged standoff with demonstrators that was punctuated by looting of several businesses, escalating into a riot. “That was heartbreaking last night,” Todd said at the press conference Sunday. “It was hard to watch that happen.” He added: “You could see some hostility in that march, but you could see good people, too. There were a lot of good people.” Looters stole furniture and other items from JL Beers and broke into Gate City Bank, but did not succeed in stealing any money, Todd said. Gov. Doug Burgum activated the North Dakota National Guard, many of whom were training over the weekend to assist law enforcement. The Guard was deployed at 9 p.m., Burgum said, and stood ready to protect firefighters if any fires were started. “We came through it without a fire; we came through it without any serious injuries,” the governor said. “That’s something to be said.” Police arrested 10 demonstrators accusing them of inciting a riot and preventing arrest. Four officers needed medical attention, including two for concussions from objects thrown and two for heat exhaustion and dehydration, Todd said. Two demonstrators received medical attention, including one for a gash on an arm, he said. There was no severe property damage, officials said, although eight police cars were damaged. Police will be reviewing video of the march and downtown confrontation and more arrests are possible, Todd said. Mahoney and Judd said the protesters’ voices were heard. They promised to work to address their concerns, but pleaded for a peaceful dialogue to address what Judd called “institutional racism” that lies at the heart of the grievances that transformed downtown Fargo into a riot scene. On Sunday morning, Mahoney lifted a curfew he had imposed Saturday night and said he hopes there will be no further demonstrations as the city works to rebuild and heal. “The heart and soul of our community … that’s our focus now,” he said. “Last night’s actions do not define this community and its people,” he said, pointing to the swift way people came together to clean up. The mayor urged people to come together to peacefully resolve grievances. “We need to hear each other, we need to be tolerant, we need to care about each other,” Mahoney said. Cass County Sheriff Jesse Jahner said that while the majority of the protesters were peaceful, many wanted confrontation, and struck a firmer note when he vowed: “Law enforcement will succeed in regaining control.” North Dakota respects and honors people's right to free speech and assembly, Burgum said. He said officials want to send a message valuing “justice and humanity” and pledged to join together to resolve issues. “It’s lost when it moves from a peaceful protest to what I think can only be described as an organized riot,” Burgum said. “If you want to have a dialogue in North Dakota, all you have to do is ask.” Local members of Black Lives Matter, which organized the march, were on hand Sunday as workers continued to clean up downtown. “The crowds down here last night does not represent us,” John Lewis said. “It was not us,” fellow organizer Ritchell Eve Aboah said. A few troublemakers turned a peaceful protest into a riot, Lewis said. “But we can’t claim responsibility for that. I’m a student. I want to make the world a better place. We are very sad that this went down yesterday. This is our home. We’re going to clean this place up, but this is not Black Lives Matter.” Judd, who said he had little sleep over the past four days, delivered an eloquent appeal to deal with the root causes underlying the frustrations that reached a flashpoint Saturday. “We honestly need to have a very serious conversation about race in this country,” he said, including a “candid conversation about institutional racism.” He added, for emphasis, “It’s true, folks.” Judd praised the Fargo Police Department, which he said acted in an “extremely professional capacity,” for displaying patience before they took firm action. “They acted with integrity,” he said. For those who turned out to protest, Judd added: “We heard you. We need in this community to listen with humility. We don’t have all the answers individually, but collectively we can make a difference in this community, and we will.” Archie Ingersoll and Chris Flynn contributed to this report.",0.0

Protesters faceoff with police in downtown Fargo FARGO — Roughly 2,000 demonstrators are still marching through the streets of Fargo and more recently West Fargo Saturday, May 30, in protest of the death of George Floyd. Floyd, a black man, died in the custody of Minneapolis police after a white officer, Derek Chauvin, knelt on his neck for several minutes on Monday, May 25. Floyd's death has sparked massive protests in Minneapolis and other cities across the country. Chauvin has been arrested and charged with murder and manslaughter. The Fargo protest, which has so far remained peaceful, began at 10 a.m. at Island Park before it continued through the downtown streets, moving west 20 blocks to police headquarters at 25th Street and First Avenue North, and then south on 25th Street. At about 1 p.m., the Fargo Police Department posted on its social media pages, asking people to avoid 13th Avenue South and 25th Street South because ""the area is becoming impassable."" Police later said the marchers were moving west toward West Acres mall but the group appeared to get smaller as time went on. Protesters shouted various chants, including ""I can't breathe"", referring to the fact that Floyd could be heard in a video of his arrest saying he couldn't breathe as the officer knelt on Floyd's neck. Protesters also chanted ""What's his name? George Floyd"", ""No justice, no peace"" and ""Prosecute the police."" Law enforcement officers in riot gear was stationed in front of Fargo police headquarters, but there have been no reports of violence. Moorhead Mayor Jonathan Judd and Fargo Mayor Tim Mahoney interacted with protesters at Fargo police headquarters, and the crowd moved on shortly afterward. Protesters headed west, eventually arriving at the West Fargo Police Department, where they peacefully protested for about a half hour while about 100 police officers from various jurisdictions stood watch, most wearing helmets and face shields. At one point, there was a mild confrontation between a nearby homeowner and some protesters. A half-dozen officers calmed the situation and the protesters kept marching through the street. Protester of all ages, some pushing baby strollers and walking with kids, are taking part, and some people have been handing out water, snacks and masks.

But a few turned out to be rioters. People gathered early on Sunday, May 31, to sweep away the destruction from a protest the night before that turned violent in the heart of a downtown littered in the aftermath with broken glass and debris. The more difficult job, leaders acknowledged in a somber press conference, will be to address the simmering distrust and alienation that boiled over into violence as remnants of a peaceful throng turned into an angry mob. The first signs of unrest became evident the afternoon of Saturday, May 30. Demonstrators marched from Island Park near downtown to demand justice in the case of George Floyd, a Minneapolis man who died after an arresting police officer knelt on his neck for eight minutes as he pleaded for mercy. Most of the demonstrators carried signs. A few hurled rocks and water bottles at the police who lined the streets along the route, which took marchers to police headquarters in Fargo and West Fargo. listen live watch live It was an early sign of what was to come. A crowd gathered outside Fargo police headquarters and, when it became clear that unrest was possible, Moorhead (Minn.) Mayor Johnathan Judd turned to Fargo Mayor Tim Mahoney and said they had to intervene. A peaceful dialogue, joined by Fargo Police Chief David Todd and some of his officers, some holding signs in solidarity with the protesters, seemed to defuse the tension. Todd even posed for photographs. The trouble came Saturday evening, when demonstrators gathered downtown. A turning point came at 5:53 p.m., when a mob surrounded two Fargo police officers in a squad car at First Avenue North and Broadway, throwing rocks and bottles, badly damaging the cruiser and menacing the officers, who were rescued by fellow officers. Todd decided that there was a limit to patience, that police should try to clear lingering protesters out of downtown before darkness fell and the situation could spiral out of control. The police had stood by with restraint “for as long as we thought we could,” Todd said Sunday.

But a few turned out to be rioters. People gathered early on Sunday, May 31, to sweep away the destruction from a protest the night before that turned violent in the heart of a downtown littered in the aftermath with broken glass and debris. The more difficult job, leaders acknowledged in a somber press conference, will be to address the simmering distrust and alienation that boiled over into violence as remnants of a peaceful throng turned into an angry mob. The first signs of unrest became evident the afternoon of Saturday, May 30. Demonstrators marched from Island Park near downtown to demand justice in the case of George Floyd, a Minneapolis man who died after an arresting police officer knelt on his neck for eight minutes as he pleaded for mercy. Most of the demonstrators carried signs. A few hurled rocks and water bottles at the police who lined the streets along the route, which took marchers to police headquarters in Fargo and West Fargo. It was an early sign of what was to come. A crowd gathered outside Fargo police headquarters and, when it became clear that unrest was possible, Moorhead (Minn.) Mayor Johnathan Judd turned to Fargo Mayor Tim Mahoney and said they had to intervene. A peaceful dialogue, joined by Fargo Police Chief David Todd and some of his officers, some holding signs in solidarity with the protesters, seemed to defuse the tension. Todd even posed for photographs. The trouble came Saturday evening, when demonstrators gathered downtown. A turning point came at 5:53 p.m., when a mob surrounded two Fargo police officers in a squad car at First Avenue North and Broadway, throwing rocks and bottles, badly damaging the cruiser and menacing the officers, who were rescued by fellow officers. Todd decided that there was a limit to patience, that police should try to clear lingering protesters out of downtown before darkness fell and the situation could spiral out of control. The police had stood by with restraint “for as long as we thought we could,” Todd said Sunday. But given the reports that elements within the protesters planned to “loot and burn,” the chief decided the time had come to act. “So we thought, while we’ve got daylight and we can see everybody, let’s try and start pushing everybody out of the downtown area.” Similarly, the mayors who had acted as peacemakers earlier in the day concluded that the situation was too combustible to try another round of dialogue with the now-angry crowd. “I have to be safe,” Judd said. “So my compromise was to stand on the bridge with the law enforcement officers from the state of Minnesota and their jurisdictions should anything come into Moorhead.” Around 8 p.m., police fired the first tear gas canisters to scatter the crowd, numbering perhaps 400 or 500, which Todd said was seeded with “instigators” whose mission was to egg on others to become violent — intelligence gleaned from plainclothes officers who mingled undercover with the demonstrators. “They were traveling from city to city to do specifically this, to cause mayhem and confusion,” he said, adding that some other protesters might have been drawn into joining the violence. A line of police officers formed on First Avenue North, slowly edging east toward Fifth Street, in a prolonged standoff with demonstrators that was punctuated by looting of several businesses, escalating into a riot. “That was heartbreaking last night,” Todd said at the press conference Sunday. “It was hard to watch that happen.” He added: “You could see some hostility in that march, but you could see good people, too. There were a lot of good people.” Looters stole furniture and other items from JL Beers and broke into Gate City Bank, but did not succeed in stealing any money, Todd said. Gov. Doug Burgum activated the North Dakota National Guard, many of whom were training over the weekend to assist law enforcement. The Guard was deployed at 9 p.m., Burgum said, and stood ready to protect firefighters if any fires were started. “We came through it without a fire; we came through it without any serious injuries,” the governor said. “That’s something to be said.” Police arrested 10 demonstrators accusing them of inciting a riot and preventing arrest. Four officers needed medical attention, including two for concussions from objects thrown and two for heat exhaustion and dehydration, Todd said. Two demonstrators received medical attention, including one for a gash on an arm, he said. There was no severe property damage, officials said, although eight police cars were damaged. Police will be reviewing video of the march and downtown confrontation and more arrests are possible, Todd said. Mahoney and Judd said the protesters’ voices were heard. They promised to work to address their concerns, but pleaded for a peaceful dialogue to address what Judd called “institutional racism” that lies at the heart of the grievances that transformed downtown Fargo into a riot scene. On Sunday morning, Mahoney lifted a curfew he had imposed Saturday night and said he hopes there will be no further demonstrations as the city works to rebuild and heal. “The heart and soul of our community … that’s our focus now,” he said. “Last night’s actions do not define this community and its people,” he said, pointing to the swift way people came together to clean up. The mayor urged people to come together to peacefully resolve grievances. “We need to hear each other, we need to be tolerant, we need to care about each other,” Mahoney said. Cass County Sheriff Jesse Jahner said that while the majority of the protesters were peaceful, many wanted confrontation, and struck a firmer note when he vowed: “Law enforcement will succeed in regaining control.” North Dakota respects and honors people's right to free speech and assembly, Burgum said. He said officials want to send a message valuing “justice and humanity” and pledged to join together to resolve issues. “It’s lost when it moves from a peaceful protest to what I think can only be described as an organized riot,” Burgum said. “If you want to have a dialogue in North Dakota, all you have to do is ask.” Local members of Black Lives Matter, which organized the march, were on hand Sunday as workers continued to clean up downtown. “The crowds down here last night does not represent us,” John Lewis said. “It was not us,” fellow organizer Ritchell Eve Aboah said. A few troublemakers turned a peaceful protest into a riot, Lewis said. “But we can’t claim responsibility for that. I’m a student. I want to make the world a better place. We are very sad that this went down yesterday. This is our home. We’re going to clean this place up, but this is not Black Lives Matter.” Judd, who said he had little sleep over the past four days, delivered an eloquent appeal to deal with the root causes underlying the frustrations that reached a flashpoint Saturday. “We honestly need to have a very serious conversation about race in this country,” he said, including a “candid conversation about institutional racism.” He added, for emphasis, “It’s true, folks.” Judd praised the Fargo Police Department, which he said acted in an “extremely professional capacity,” for displaying patience before they took firm action. “They acted with integrity,” he said. For those who turned out to protest, Judd added: “We heard you. We need in this community to listen with humility. We don’t have all the answers individually, but collectively we can make a difference in this community, and we will.” Archie Ingersoll and Chris Flynn contributed to this report.",0.0

Protesters faceoff with police in downtown Fargo FARGO — Roughly 2,000 demonstrators are still marching through the streets of Fargo and more recently West Fargo Saturday, May 30, in protest of the death of George Floyd. Floyd, a black man, died in the custody of Minneapolis police after a white officer, Derek Chauvin, knelt on his neck for several minutes on Monday, May 25. Floyd's death has sparked massive protests in Minneapolis and other cities across the country. Chauvin has been arrested and charged with murder and manslaughter. The Fargo protest, which has so far remained peaceful, began at 10 a.m. at Island Park before it continued through the downtown streets, moving west 20 blocks to police headquarters at 25th Street and First Avenue North, and then south on 25th Street. At about 1 p.m., the Fargo Police Department posted on its social media pages, asking people to avoid 13th Avenue South and 25th Street South because ""the area is becoming impassable."" Police later said the marchers were moving west toward West Acres mall but the group appeared to get smaller as time went on.

But apparently, it hit none of them, according to authorities, who were unclear of the driver’s motives as of 8 p.m. “Not to have a tragedy and many deaths is just an amazing thing,” Gov. Tim Walz said at 7 p.m., a little over an hour after the incident happened. The driver was mobbed by the crowd, detained for police, who arrested him. After being treated at a hospital for non life-threatening injuries, he was released into police custody.

Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington said authorities continued to discover caches of incendiary materials in vehicles and other places.

They were associated with a fleet of vehicles, many if not all stolen, that have been stripped of license plates. Harrington said the pattern speaks to sophisticated planning and coordination. 1,500 protesters march from Capitol About 1,500 people who gathered for a large protest at the Capitol in St. Paul on Sunday began marching later in the afternoon and walked onto Interstate 94. They headed westbound for about an hour before they exited. Police described the group as organized and peaceful. After leaving the Capitol, the group used the St. Anthony Avenue ramp to enter Interstate 94 West shortly after 4 p.m. They exited at Lexington Parkway about 5 p.m. to University Avenue and headed east. The protest began at 1 p.m., with people calling for a special prosecutor to be appointed in the case of George Floyd, who died on Monday after a Minneapolis police officer was seen on video kneeling on his neck. Derek Chauvin, who was fired from the police department, was charged Friday with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter in Floyd’s death. Later Sunday, Gov. Tim Walz announced Attorney General Keith Ellis will lead the case. People at Sunday’s protest were also calling for three other officers who were present, and who have also been terminated from the Minneapolis police department, to be arrested and charged. Arrest total: 155 More than 155 people were arrested on Saturday night and Sunday as law enforcement and the Minnesota National Guard changed tactics after several nights of arson and looting in the Twin Cities. Based on intelligence gathered by law enforcement and with the cooperation of community members, the Minnesota Multi-Agency Command Center “deployed fast-moving teams to targets that were of high value and high probability of attack,” according to a statement from the Department of Public Safety. People were arrested on suspicion of curfew violation, weapons possession, narcotics possession and rioting, according to DPS. The State Patrol confiscated seven firearms and the Minneapolis Police Department recovered five firearms. Truck vs. crowd TV aerial video and state traffic cameras showed a disturbing and chaotic series of events before 6 p.m. after a large crowd of marchers had taken to I-35W, which was officially closed at 5 p.m. Harrington said that preliminary reviews of state traffic cameras suggested the driver was already on the highway when crews began closing it. There were no signs the driver ever drove around any barriers, he said. Here’s the full statement by the Department of Public Safety: “Very disturbing actions by a truck driver on I-35W, inciting a crowd of peaceful demonstrators. The truck driver was injured & taken to a hospital with non-life threatening injuries. He is under arrest. It doesn’t appear any protesters were hit by the truck.” The 18-wheeler tanker truck drove toward and into the edge of the crowd at what appeared to be swift speed before coming to a halt. The crowd largely appeared to scatter in advance of the truck. The truck did not appear to swerve or veer toward the crowd as it came to a stop. The cab was soon mobbed. Video shows the truck then begin to drive forward again with people on its hood and clinging to both sides of the cab. One of them appeared to break the driver’s front window, and the truck stopped rolling. That person can be seen breaching the cab through the driver’s front window. Immediately following, the crowds fled from the stretch of interstate, which is elevated as it approaches a span over the Mississippi River. Some people could be seen vaulting over guardrails. Police soon swarmed the area. Around 6:20 p.m., a convoy of National Guard trucks, including some with a medical insignia, arrived on the scene. Before the incident, a large crowd of perhaps thousands had been marching and sitting on the bridge in what appeared to be a largely peaceful protest.

A large group of protesters gathered in First Avenue North just west of Broadway as riot gear-clad police formed a line in front of the crowd. The Fargo Police Department is asking the public to avoid downtown Fargo. Protesters faceoff with police in downtown Fargo FARGO — Roughly 2,000 demonstrators are still marching through the streets of Fargo and more recently West Fargo Saturday, May 30, in protest of the death of George Floyd. Floyd, a black man, died in the custody of Minneapolis police after a white officer, Derek Chauvin, knelt on his neck for several minutes on Monday, May 25. Floyd's death has sparked massive protests in Minneapolis and other cities across the country. Chauvin has been arrested and charged with murder and manslaughter. The Fargo protest, which has so far remained peaceful, began at 10 a.m. at Island Park before it continued through the downtown streets, moving west 20 blocks to police headquarters at 25th Street and First Avenue North, and then south on 25th Street. At about 1 p.m., the Fargo Police Department posted on its social media pages, asking people to avoid 13th Avenue South and 25th Street South because ""the area is becoming impassable."" Police later said the marchers were moving west toward West Acres mall but the group appeared to get smaller as time went on. Protesters shouted various chants, including ""I can't breathe"", referring to the fact that Floyd could be heard in a video of his arrest saying he couldn't breathe as the officer knelt on Floyd's neck. Protesters also chanted ""What's his name? George Floyd"", ""No justice, no peace"" and ""Prosecute the police."" Law enforcement officers in riot gear was stationed in front of Fargo police headquarters, but there have been no reports of violence. Moorhead Mayor Jonathan Judd and Fargo Mayor Tim Mahoney interacted with protesters at Fargo police headquarters, and the crowd moved on shortly afterward. Protesters headed west, eventually arriving at the West Fargo Police Department, where they peacefully protested for about a half hour while about 100 police officers from various jurisdictions stood watch, most wearing helmets and face shields. At one point, there was a mild confrontation between a nearby homeowner and some protesters. A half-dozen officers calmed the situation and the protesters kept marching through the street. Protester of all ages, some pushing baby strollers and walking with kids, are taking part, and some people have been handing out water, snacks and masks.

But apparently, it hit none of them, according to authorities, who were unclear of the driver’s motives as of 8 p.m. “Not to have a tragedy and many deaths is just an amazing thing,” Gov. Tim Walz said at 7 p.m., a little over an hour after the incident happened. The driver was mobbed by the crowd, detained for police, who arrested him. After being treated at a hospital for non life-threatening injuries, he was released into police custody. The horrifying and chaotic incident was still being investigated as nightfall approached, heralding the third straight night of curfew and highway closures as the metro area and thousands of law enforcement and National Guard personnel braced for whatever the night might bring. listen live watch live The area is reeling following a week that witnessed widespread and unchecked violence, looting and fires until Saturday night, when the state’s largest-ever assemblage of law enforcement — a militarized force, really — was aided by widespread curfew compliance and seized control of the streets. In a pattern that has played out in cities across the nation, the demonstrations followed by escalating violence began after Monday’s death of George Floyd, an unarmed black man who died after a Minneapolis police officer knelt on him. Arsonists’ caches There were signs that those intent on doing harm — and it’s unclear exactly who they are — would try again Sunday. Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington said authorities continued to discover caches of incendiary materials in vehicles and other places. Some appeared to be days old and were found in areas where fires previously had been set, while others appeared to have been placed within the previous 24 hours. They were associated with a fleet of vehicles, many if not all stolen, that have been stripped of license plates. Harrington said the pattern speaks to sophisticated planning and coordination. 1,500 protesters march from Capitol About 1,500 people who gathered for a large protest at the Capitol in St. Paul on Sunday began marching later in the afternoon and walked onto Interstate 94. They headed westbound for about an hour before they exited. Police described the group as organized and peaceful. After leaving the Capitol, the group used the St. Anthony Avenue ramp to enter Interstate 94 West shortly after 4 p.m. They exited at Lexington Parkway about 5 p.m. to University Avenue and headed east. The protest began at 1 p.m., with people calling for a special prosecutor to be appointed in the case of George Floyd, who died on Monday after a Minneapolis police officer was seen on video kneeling on his neck. Derek Chauvin, who was fired from the police department, was charged Friday with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter in Floyd’s death. Later Sunday, Gov. Tim Walz announced Attorney General Keith Ellis will lead the case. People at Sunday’s protest were also calling for three other officers who were present, and who have also been terminated from the Minneapolis police department, to be arrested and charged. Arrest total: 155 More than 155 people were arrested on Saturday night and Sunday as law enforcement and the Minnesota National Guard changed tactics after several nights of arson and looting in the Twin Cities. Based on intelligence gathered by law enforcement and with the cooperation of community members, the Minnesota Multi-Agency Command Center “deployed fast-moving teams to targets that were of high value and high probability of attack,” according to a statement from the Department of Public Safety. People were arrested on suspicion of curfew violation, weapons possession, narcotics possession and rioting, according to DPS. The State Patrol confiscated seven firearms and the Minneapolis Police Department recovered five firearms. Truck vs. crowd TV aerial video and state traffic cameras showed a disturbing and chaotic series of events before 6 p.m. after a large crowd of marchers had taken to I-35W, which was officially closed at 5 p.m. Harrington said that preliminary reviews of state traffic cameras suggested the driver was already on the highway when crews began closing it. There were no signs the driver ever drove around any barriers, he said. Here’s the full statement by the Department of Public Safety: “Very disturbing actions by a truck driver on I-35W, inciting a crowd of peaceful demonstrators. The truck driver was injured & taken to a hospital with non-life threatening injuries. He is under arrest. It doesn’t appear any protesters were hit by the truck.” The 18-wheeler tanker truck drove toward and into the edge of the crowd at what appeared to be swift speed before coming to a halt. The crowd largely appeared to scatter in advance of the truck. The truck did not appear to swerve or veer toward the crowd as it came to a stop. The cab was soon mobbed. Video shows the truck then begin to drive forward again with people on its hood and clinging to both sides of the cab. One of them appeared to break the driver’s front window, and the truck stopped rolling. That person can be seen breaching the cab through the driver’s front window. Immediately following, the crowds fled from the stretch of interstate, which is elevated as it approaches a span over the Mississippi River. Some people could be seen vaulting over guardrails. Police soon swarmed the area. Around 6:20 p.m., a convoy of National Guard trucks, including some with a medical insignia, arrived on the scene. Before the incident, a large crowd of perhaps thousands had been marching and sitting on the bridge in what appeared to be a largely peaceful protest. They arrived there as one of several bands of crowds that had recently left a peaceful protest at U.S. Bank Stadium. Nick Ferraro, Fred Melo and Mara H.

North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum said that in talking with law enforcement officers who spent the night quelling rioting it was clear to the officers that some who took part in Saturday's event were not there to promote progress, but instead came to the area ""for violence and vandalism."" Saturday's rioting resulted in 10 people arrested and booked into jail on suspicion of misdemeanor charges of inciting a riot and felony charges of preventing arrest, according to Fargo police, who worked on verifying those arrested on Sunday. One of the 10 arrested was listed as being from out of town, while another had no permanent address. The out-of-town resident from Fresno, Calif., was also arrested on a drug charge and carrying a concealed weapon. Police Chief Dave Todd echoed Burgum's remarks during the news conference regarding the motivations of some protesters. listen live watch live Todd said information gained by undercover officers who mingled with protesters combined with other intelligence led authorities to conclude that some demonstrators at Saturday's event were there primarily to ""loot and burn."" Todd said four police officers were injured during clashes with protesters, including two officers who suffered concussions from being hit with objects and two officers who suffered from heat exhaustion. Police also reported in a release later Sunday that eight patrol squad cars were damaged, ranging from broken windows, dented hoods and broken mirrors. Todd said police are reviewing footage from city surveillance cameras and additional arrests may be possible. Police also said in the release that 22 agencies assisted them in the situation, including the North Dakota Highway Patrol, Cass County Sheriff's Department, Moorhead police, Clay County Sheriff's Department and officers from as far away as Pembina in far northeast North Dakota and Mandan's police department. Fargo's department started the day off with 65 officers on duty, with an ""all department callback"" sent out at 1 p.m. In another statement released by police, they said that a call came in at 8:25 p.m. on Saturday night regarding four males carrying assault rifles, who told Cass County deputies that they were headed to the protest site to protect businesses. Deputies explained that it was not a good idea and the four men decided to leave. No arrests in that incident were made, police said. According to an online list created by the Cass County Jail, the 10 people were being held in the jail Sunday morning on suspicion of inciting a riot and felony preventing arrest were: Kylee Angelise-Hope Davidson, 21, Fargo Martin Edward Jackson, 34, West Fargo Adam Christopher Maack, 31, Fargo Kimberly Aulakh, 35, Fargo Negasi Gebrehiwot Berhe, 23, Fargo Natascha May Gripentrog, 29, West Fargo Errick Steven Toa, 33, Fargo Gary Zende, 69, Fargo Teddy Anthony Mata, 26, Fresno, Calif., who was also arrested for carrying a concealed weapon and possessing a controlled drug. Godana Hajmadi, 31, no permanent address. He has been bailed out. Much of the demonstrating that occurred Saturday in Fargo was peaceful as crowds marched to show their anger and frustration over the death of George Floyd, who died while being arrested by Minneapolis police on May 25. Rally organizers said the event they planned came to an end about 6 p.m. Saturday, around the time Fargo police began warning demonstrators the event had become unlawful and authorities would take steps to shut it down. Todd said officers attempted several times to disengage from protesters as a way to disarm tensions, but each time demonstrators pressed forward aggressively, eventually starting to throw bottles of water and other objects at officers. Todd said officers became trapped in a vehicle when protesters surrounded it and began pounding on its windows and it was at that point a decision was made to push increasingly hostile protesters out of the downtown area. About 8:10 p.m., officers began pushing the crowd eastward down First Avenue North and protesters reacted by throwing rocks and other objects. Authorities fired rounds from pepperball guns and dispensed tear gas as demonstrators created a makeshift barrier using dumpsters from a nearby business. Around the same time, protesters began smashing windows of businesses, including JL Beers, the Hotel Donaldson and Gate City Bank. Todd said demonstrators were able to get inside JL Beers and the bank, but no money was taken. He said prior to the start of the rioting a number of individuals who were involved in the demonstrations attempted to keep people calm and he said those actions may have prevented some officers from being harmed. Todd said those who tried to keep the event from turning violent have his gratitude. According to Todd, there were reports of protesters getting hurt, including one who suffered a gash to their arm and another who may have been shot in the leg. Todd said Sunday morning that he hadn't been able to confirm whether someone was shot, or what the circumstances may have been. Forum reporter Barry Amundson contributed to this report",0.0

In this July 17, 2019, file photo, Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms speaks during a Senate Democrats' Special Committee on the Climate Crisis on Capitol Hill in Washington. (Source: AP Photo/Andrew Harnik/AP) Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said at a news conference that she and police Chief Erika Shields made the decision after reviewing body-camera footage of a Saturday night incident that first gained attention from video online and on local news. ""Use of excessive force is never acceptable,"" Bottoms told reporters. Shields called the footage ""really shocking to watch."" Police on Sunday night identified the fired officers as Investigator Ivory Streeter, who was hired in December 2003, and Investigator Mark Gardner, who was hired in August 1997. Bottoms said the woman, Taniyah Pilgrim, was released without charges. She said the man, Messiah Young, was released, too, and she's ordering the charges against him dropped. She didn't specify what charges he faced. A police report says Young was charged with attempting to elude police and driving with a suspended license. Dramatic body camera video that police released Sunday night shows police taking another young man into custody in a downtown street alongside a line of stopped cars. The man is pleading with police to let him go, saying he didn't do anything. Young, sitting in the driver's seat of a car stopped in the street holds up his phone, appearing to shoot video as an officer approaches and pulls the driver's side door open. Young pulls the door shut and says repeatedly, ""I'm not dying today."" He urges the officers to release the other man and let him get in the car as the dark sedan advances a bit. The car gets stuck in traffic and officers run up to both sides of the car shouting orders. An officer uses a stun gun on Pilgrim as she's trying to get out of the car and then officers pull her from the vehicle. Another officer yells at Young to put the car in park and open the window. An officer repeatedly hits the driver's side window with a baton, and another officer finally manages to break it. As the glass shatters, an officer uses a stun gun on Young and officers pull him from the car as officers shout, ""Get your hand out of your pockets,"" and, ""He got a gun. He got a gun. He got a gun."" Once he's out of the car and on the ground, officers zip tie Young's hands behind his back and lead him away. Police reports do not list a gun as having been recovered. The mayor said she had delayed the news conference several hours to review all the body-camera footage because she and Shields wanted to be certain about what happened. ""I really wanted to believe that the body-worn camera footage would provide some larger view that could better rationalize why we got to this space,"" Shields said. ""And having spent most of the afternoon with the mayor, reviewing the footage exhaustively, I knew that I had only one option, and that is to terminate the employees."" Bottoms said she had spoken to leaders at Spelman College and Morehouse College, where she said the the young people were students. She said she'd also spoken to representatives for the students but hadn't yet spoken directly to them. Shields offered an apology and said she knows the officers' behavior was unacceptable and caused further fear. ""Sometimes the best thing, the only thing you can do as a police chief is come in and clean up the mess that's before you,"" Shields said. ""When wrong is wrong, we have to, as law enforcement, start dealing with it in the same manner that we would deal with it with non-law enforcement,"" Shields said. ""For some reason, we've fallen into a gray area where there's a separate set of rules for law enforcement, and if we want to get out of this space that we're in now we have to change how we manage internally."" Shields said she experienced a broad range of emotions as just a few hours before she saw the video, another of her officers was seriously injured. A preliminary investigation indicates the officer was in an intersection on foot to block traffic from passing into an area where there were protesters when a person on an ATV approached at a high rate of speed and hit him. Officer Maximilian Brewer suffered significant injuries to his legs and remained in the intensive care unit Sunday evening, Shields said, adding that she hopes he'll be able to walk again. The ATV rider was taken into custody at the scene and to a hospital with non-life-threatening injuries. Police on Sunday night identified the driver of the ATV as 42-year-old Avery Goggans. He has been charged with DUI, serious injury by vehicle, reckless driving, possession of marijuana and several other traffic charges, police Sgt. John Chafee said in an email. Bottoms imposed a 9 p.m. curfew for Saturday and Sunday. Gov. Brian Kemp authorized up to 3,000 National Guard troops to be deployed in cities across the state to respond if needed to protests over the deaths of George Floyd in Minnesota and Ahmaud Arbery in coastal Georgia. Atlanta police said Sunday they had arrested more than 150 people as protesters threw rocks at officers and broke windows in the downtown area. The curfew was initially imposed after demonstrations Friday night turned violent with people setting fires and smashing windows at businesses and restaurants. Copyright 2020 Associated Press.

But apparently, it hit none of them, according to authorities, who were unclear of the driver’s motives as of 8 p.m. “Not to have a tragedy and many deaths is just an amazing thing,” Gov. Tim Walz said at 7 p.m., a little over an hour after the incident happened. The driver was mobbed by the crowd, detained for police, who arrested him. After being treated at a hospital for non life-threatening injuries, he was released into police custody. The horrifying and chaotic incident was still being investigated as nightfall approached, heralding the third straight night of curfew and highway closures as the metro area and thousands of law enforcement and National Guard personnel braced for whatever the night might bring. The area is reeling following a week that witnessed widespread and unchecked violence, looting and fires until Saturday night, when the state’s largest-ever assemblage of law enforcement — a militarized force, really — was aided by widespread curfew compliance and seized control of the streets. In a pattern that has played out in cities across the nation, the demonstrations followed by escalating violence began after Monday’s death of George Floyd, an unarmed black man who died after a Minneapolis police officer knelt on him. Arsonists’ caches There were signs that those intent on doing harm — and it’s unclear exactly who they are — would try again Sunday. Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington said authorities continued to discover caches of incendiary materials in vehicles and other places. Some appeared to be days old and were found in areas where fires previously had been set, while others appeared to have been placed within the previous 24 hours. They were associated with a fleet of vehicles, many if not all stolen, that have been stripped of license plates. Harrington said the pattern speaks to sophisticated planning and coordination. 1,500 protesters march from Capitol About 1,500 people who gathered for a large protest at the Capitol in St. Paul on Sunday began marching later in the afternoon and walked onto Interstate 94. They headed westbound for about an hour before they exited. Police described the group as organized and peaceful. After leaving the Capitol, the group used the St. Anthony Avenue ramp to enter Interstate 94 West shortly after 4 p.m. They exited at Lexington Parkway about 5 p.m. to University Avenue and headed east. The protest began at 1 p.m., with people calling for a special prosecutor to be appointed in the case of George Floyd, who died on Monday after a Minneapolis police officer was seen on video kneeling on his neck. Derek Chauvin, who was fired from the police department, was charged Friday with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter in Floyd’s death. Later Sunday, Gov. Tim Walz announced Attorney General Keith Ellis will lead the case. People at Sunday’s protest were also calling for three other officers who were present, and who have also been terminated from the Minneapolis police department, to be arrested and charged. Arrest total: 155 More than 155 people were arrested on Saturday night and Sunday as law enforcement and the Minnesota National Guard changed tactics after several nights of arson and looting in the Twin Cities. Based on intelligence gathered by law enforcement and with the cooperation of community members, the Minnesota Multi-Agency Command Center “deployed fast-moving teams to targets that were of high value and high probability of attack,” according to a statement from the Department of Public Safety. People were arrested on suspicion of curfew violation, weapons possession, narcotics possession and rioting, according to DPS. The State Patrol confiscated seven firearms and the Minneapolis Police Department recovered five firearms. Truck vs. crowd TV aerial video and state traffic cameras showed a disturbing and chaotic series of events before 6 p.m. after a large crowd of marchers had taken to I-35W, which was officially closed at 5 p.m. Harrington said that preliminary reviews of state traffic cameras suggested the driver was already on the highway when crews began closing it. There were no signs the driver ever drove around any barriers, he said. Here’s the full statement by the Department of Public Safety: “Very disturbing actions by a truck driver on I-35W, inciting a crowd of peaceful demonstrators. The truck driver was injured & taken to a hospital with non-life threatening injuries. He is under arrest. It doesn’t appear any protesters were hit by the truck.” The 18-wheeler tanker truck drove toward and into the edge of the crowd at what appeared to be swift speed before coming to a halt. The crowd largely appeared to scatter in advance of the truck. The truck did not appear to swerve or veer toward the crowd as it came to a stop. The cab was soon mobbed. Video shows the truck then begin to drive forward again with people on its hood and clinging to both sides of the cab. One of them appeared to break the driver’s front window, and the truck stopped rolling. That person can be seen breaching the cab through the driver’s front window. Immediately following, the crowds fled from the stretch of interstate, which is elevated as it approaches a span over the Mississippi River. Some people could be seen vaulting over guardrails. Police soon swarmed the area. Around 6:20 p.m., a convoy of National Guard trucks, including some with a medical insignia, arrived on the scene. Before the incident, a large crowd of perhaps thousands had been marching and sitting on the bridge in what appeared to be a largely peaceful protest. They arrived there as one of several bands of crowds that had recently left a peaceful protest at U.S. Bank Stadium. Nick Ferraro, Fred Melo and Mara H.

Joe Biden quietly visited the site of protests in his hometown of Wilmington, Delaware, and talked to some of the demonstrators. Earlier, he wrote a post on Medium expressing empathy for those despairing about the killing of George Floyd. On Monday, he'll meet with community leaders in Wilmington. That low-key, high-touch approach may be a sign of how the presumptive Democratic nominee presents himself in the five months before the presidential election, emphasizing calm and competence as a contrast to a mercurial president. It is an approach that carries the risk of being drowned out by the much louder, more persistent voice of Trump. On one of the most profound weekends the nation has seen, with violence in dozens of cities, Biden was out of wide public view. “He’s not in office, and he certainly does not have the megaphone like the person currently occupying the White House does, but I do think our people are looking for someone who can make them feel better during these extremely tough times,” said Rep. Val Demings of Florida, whom Biden is considering as a running mate. “America just needs to be reassured that there’s someone who’s understanding, someone who’s willing to say, ‘Yes, we do have some issues,’ and someone who’s willing to address it.” Reassurance requires presence, though, and that has been a hurdle for the former vice president, driven inside by the coronavirus pandemic, still working to adapt to the power of social media as a substitute and without the natural platform of a public office. Demings suggested the campaign will be doing more soon. Biden released a criminal justice reform plan last July, but has not issued an updated or more specific proposal since then. In early May, he released his “Plan for Black America,” an economic- and education-focused agenda that included marijuana decriminalization. The congresswoman said she planned to work with other members of the Congressional Black Caucus and other Democratic lawmakers on Capitol Hill to try to help craft reforms, though she would not confirm or deny any conversations she had with the Biden campaign about the push. “What I have done is offer my service to the campaign and, and anyone else, to look at what we can do working together moving forward. And so we’ll see. We have a lot of work to do,” she said. “We’re going to discuss ideas and make recommendations.” Demings said she would push for a major Justice Department review of law enforcement agencies throughout the country, and said she saw a role for the federal government in implementing standard policies that govern hiring, training, retention and pay and benefits for law enforcement officers. So far, however, Democrats are banking that time and the nation's political mood are on their side. They note that while Biden didn't appear on television all weekend, he spoke about Floyd's death before Trump addressed it and has shown compassion for the protesters. Trump has alternated between expressing alarm over Floyd's death and sympathy for his family and issuing tweets antagonizing protesters and disparaging his political enemies. Some Biden aides who aren't authorized to discuss strategy privately say the campaign thinks the best plan may be to let Trump do himself in. Some Democrats who have criticized Biden in the past for not being more visible during the onset of the coronavirus said he is making the right moves now. “I’m sure they have some reluctance, understandably, right now to politicize it. That’s not who he is,"" said Democratic strategist James Carville. “There might be a time for eloquence, but I think that simplicity is eloquence right now.” Copyright 2020 Associated Press.

That was not at all our message,” says Ritchell Aboah. “You don’t go around burning or breaking stuff,” adds Matuor Alier, another protestor. “These are our shops. This is the local shop.

Gov. Doug Burgum stresses, “If you want to have a dialogue in North Dakota, all you have to do is ask. We stand ready to meet with anyone to hear their concerns, to listen, to be present, to feel whatever hurt they may have, regardless of how many generations they may feel they’ve been wronged.” Burgum goes on to say that in North Dakota, there’s the space, time and capabilities to have these types of discussions.

Among those doing the cleaning were many who organized a massive peaceful protest that proceeded the riots. They feel the pain from Saturday night maybe more so than anyone. “Our message was clear from the very start of our protest. We are seeking a systemic change, but this justice cannot be attainable through this violent act,” said protest organizer, Joseph Lewis. “This defeats the purpose of which we worked so hard to do,” added protest organizer, Ritchell Aboah. “This takes away from the message and that message is that we are united. We are equal.” Aboah has lived in Fargo for 6 years and she says yesterday was the first time she has truly felt that the city was united and that it would stand up to injustice after seeing thousands come out for the peaceful rally. That is why she is hurting. She knows there is good here and it breaks her heart to have to see her community suffer like this. That has never been the intention. “The judicial system that is against our people is our target, not our local business owners who have worked so hard to build what they have,” says Aboah. “We will not destroy that. That will not be the narrative of that protest yesterday.” She says the people who caused this damage are not the same people who marched alongside her. “Those who protest yesterday peacefully from 10a.m. – 6p.m. are out here cleaning. Helping to get our community back because we know that Fargo is a community of unity,” said Aboah. “We will not condone any violence. That will not be our message. Our message is peace and justice.” Downtown is on it’s way back to restoring peace after Saturday’s tragic events. As a united front, the peaceful protesters, the Fargo police, and everyone who live in this community are working to make that happen.",0.0

But apparently, it hit none of them, according to authorities, who were unclear of the driver’s motives as of 8 p.m. “Not to have a tragedy and many deaths is just an amazing thing,” Gov. Tim Walz said at 7 p.m., a little over an hour after the incident happened. The driver was mobbed by the crowd, detained for police, who arrested him. After being treated at a hospital for non life-threatening injuries, he was released into police custody. The horrifying and chaotic incident was still being investigated as nightfall approached, heralding the third straight night of curfew and highway closures as the metro area and thousands of law enforcement and National Guard personnel braced for whatever the night might bring. The area is reeling following a week that witnessed widespread and unchecked violence, looting and fires until Saturday night, when the state’s largest-ever assemblage of law enforcement — a militarized force, really — was aided by widespread curfew compliance and seized control of the streets. In a pattern that has played out in cities across the nation, the demonstrations followed by escalating violence began after Monday’s death of George Floyd, an unarmed black man who died after a Minneapolis police officer knelt on him. Arsonists’ caches There were signs that those intent on doing harm — and it’s unclear exactly who they are — would try again Sunday. Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington said authorities continued to discover caches of incendiary materials in vehicles and other places. Some appeared to be days old and were found in areas where fires previously had been set, while others appeared to have been placed within the previous 24 hours. They were associated with a fleet of vehicles, many if not all stolen, that have been stripped of license plates. Harrington said the pattern speaks to sophisticated planning and coordination. 1,500 protesters march from Capitol About 1,500 people who gathered for a large protest at the Capitol in St. Paul on Sunday began marching later in the afternoon and walked onto Interstate 94. They headed westbound for about an hour before they exited. Police described the group as organized and peaceful. After leaving the Capitol, the group used the St. Anthony Avenue ramp to enter Interstate 94 West shortly after 4 p.m. They exited at Lexington Parkway about 5 p.m. to University Avenue and headed east. The protest began at 1 p.m., with people calling for a special prosecutor to be appointed in the case of George Floyd, who died on Monday after a Minneapolis police officer was seen on video kneeling on his neck. Derek Chauvin, who was fired from the police department, was charged Friday with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter in Floyd’s death. Later Sunday, Gov. Tim Walz announced Attorney General Keith Ellis will lead the case. People at Sunday’s protest were also calling for three other officers who were present, and who have also been terminated from the Minneapolis police department, to be arrested and charged. Arrest total: 155 More than 155 people were arrested on Saturday night and Sunday as law enforcement and the Minnesota National Guard changed tactics after several nights of arson and looting in the Twin Cities. Based on intelligence gathered by law enforcement and with the cooperation of community members, the Minnesota Multi-Agency Command Center “deployed fast-moving teams to targets that were of high value and high probability of attack,” according to a statement from the Department of Public Safety. People were arrested on suspicion of curfew violation, weapons possession, narcotics possession and rioting, according to DPS. The State Patrol confiscated seven firearms and the Minneapolis Police Department recovered five firearms. Truck vs. crowd TV aerial video and state traffic cameras showed a disturbing and chaotic series of events before 6 p.m. after a large crowd of marchers had taken to I-35W, which was officially closed at 5 p.m. Harrington said that preliminary reviews of state traffic cameras suggested the driver was already on the highway when crews began closing it. There were no signs the driver ever drove around any barriers, he said. Here’s the full statement by the Department of Public Safety: “Very disturbing actions by a truck driver on I-35W, inciting a crowd of peaceful demonstrators. The truck driver was injured & taken to a hospital with non-life threatening injuries. He is under arrest. It doesn’t appear any protesters were hit by the truck.” The 18-wheeler tanker truck drove toward and into the edge of the crowd at what appeared to be swift speed before coming to a halt. The crowd largely appeared to scatter in advance of the truck. The truck did not appear to swerve or veer toward the crowd as it came to a stop. The cab was soon mobbed. Video shows the truck then begin to drive forward again with people on its hood and clinging to both sides of the cab. One of them appeared to break the driver’s front window, and the truck stopped rolling. That person can be seen breaching the cab through the driver’s front window. Immediately following, the crowds fled from the stretch of interstate, which is elevated as it approaches a span over the Mississippi River. Some people could be seen vaulting over guardrails. Police soon swarmed the area. Around 6:20 p.m., a convoy of National Guard trucks, including some with a medical insignia, arrived on the scene. Before the incident, a large crowd of perhaps thousands had been marching and sitting on the bridge in what appeared to be a largely peaceful protest. They arrived there as one of several bands of crowds that had recently left a peaceful protest at U.S. Bank Stadium. Nick Ferraro, Fred Melo and Mara H.

A City of Miami Police officer talks with protesters telling them that they will lend them their support during a demonstration, Saturday, May 30, 2020, downtown in Miami. Protests across the country have escalated over the death of George Floyd who died after being restrained by Minneapolis police officers on Memorial Day, May 25. (AP Photo/Wilfredo Lee) Nearly 26,000 nursing home residents in the United States have died from COVID-19, according to the report prepared for the nation’s governors, a number that is partial and likely to go higher. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported 60,000 cases of coronavirus illness among nursing home residents, according to a copy of the letter addressed to the governors and an accompanying chart provided to The Associated Press. The data was based on reports received from about 80% of the nation’s 15,400 nursing homes as of May 24. But some states with high rates of nursing home deaths appeared to have some of the lowest levels of response to the federal data-gathering survey, intended as a first step toward developing policy changes. “This data, and anecdotal reports across the country, clearly show that nursing homes have been devastated by the virus,” wrote CDC Director Robert Redfield and CMS Administrator Seema Verma. The U.S. has seen over 104,000 deaths and nearly 1.8 million infections in the pandemic, both count’s the highest in the world. And although the first wave of the pandemic may be easing in much of the U.S., that doesn’t mean nursing homes are in any less danger: Experts say in a virus rebound they can again become the stage for tragic scenes of death and despair, as well as a risk for the broader community. “What is going on in a nursing home can be a barometer for where the virus is,” said Tamara Konetzka, a research professor at the University of Chicago, who specializes in long-term care issues. As tourist destination worldwide reopened for business, new rules were in place to guard against the virus' spread. The Florida Keys welcomed visitors for the first time in two months, the Colosseum opened its ancient doors in Rome, ferries restarted in Bangladesh and golfers played in Greece. But even as the tourist-dependent Keys took down barriers to allow visitors, Miami-Dade County kept its beaches closed because of protests in South Florida and across the country over the May 25 death of George Floyd, a black man pinned at the neck by a white police officer in Minneapolis. Roadblocks were taken down shortly after midnight near Key Largo, the northernmost island in the Florida chain, where almost half of all workers are employed by hotels, bars and other hospitality industries, and many of the rest are involved in commercial and sport fishing. Richard Stanczyk, owner of Bud N’ Mary’s marina in Islamorada, said the 40 captains who operate fishing boats out of the 76-year-old business have had virtually no customers for weeks and welcomed the reopening. “There has been a real uptick in phone calls. There have been more charter bookings,” Stanczyk said. “We are encouraged. It’s going to come back.” Yet the carefree, party atmosphere that surrounds the Keys and was popularized by singer Jimmy Buffet in songs like “Margaritaville” may not return for some time. The Monroe County Tourist Development Council made clear on its website that visitors must adhere to health guidelines. “Bring facial coverings, gloves, hand sanitizer, reef-safe sunscreen and personal essential medicines. If you’re feeling unwell, please stay home,” it said. Countries around the Mediterranean Sea also tentatively kicked off a summer season where tourists could bask in their famously sunny beaches with distancing measures in place. “We are reopening a symbol. A symbol of Rome, a symbol for Italy,” said Alfonsina Russo, director of the Colosseum’s archaeological park. “(We are) restarting in a positive way, with a different pace, with a more sustainable tourism.” Greece lifted lockdown measures for hotels, campsites, open-air cinemas, golf courses and public swimming pools, while b eaches and museums reopened in Turkey and bars, restaurants, cinemas and museums came back to life in the Netherlands. “Today, we opened two rooms and tomorrow three. It’s like building an anthill,” Athens hotel owner Panos Betis said as employees wearing face masks tidied a rooftop restaurant and cleaned a window facing the ancient Acropolis. “Our aim now is to hang in there until 2021."" A long line of masked visitors snaked outside the Vatican Museums, which include the Sistine Chapel, as they reopened for the first time in three months. The Vatican Museums’ famous keyholder — the “clavigero” who holds the keys to all the galleries on a big ring on his wrist — opened the gate in a sign both symbolic and literal that the Museums were back in business. Still, strict crowd control measures were in place: Visitors needed reservations, their temperatures were taken before entering and masks were mandatory. The Dutch relaxation of coronavirus rules took place on a major holiday with the sun blazing, raising fears of overcrowding in popular beach resorts. The new rules let bars and restaurants serve up to 30 people inside if they keep social distancing, but there was no standing at bars and reservations were necessary. Britain, which has the world's second-worst death toll behind the United States, eased restrictions despite warnings from health officials that the risk of spreading COVID-19 was still too great. Some elementary classes reopened and people could have limited contact with family and friends, but only outdoors and with social distancing. Around 6.19 million infections have been reported worldwide, with over 372,000 people dying, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. The true death toll is believed to be significantly higher, since many died without ever being tested. In the U.S., the often-violent protests over Floyd's death raised fears of new outbreaks in a country where the pandemic has disproportionately affected racial minorities. Protests have shaken cities from New York to Los Angeles, with d emonstrators packed cheek by jowl, many without masks, shouting or singing. The virus is spread by microscopic droplets in the air when people cough, sneeze, talk or sing. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo expressed concern Monday the protests in New York City could imperil the long, hard fight to contain the pandemic in a worldwide hot spot. “You turn on the TV and you see these mass gatherings that could potentially be infecting hundreds and hundreds of people after everything that we have done,” Cuomo said. “We have to take a minute and ask ourselves: ’What are we doing here?” ___ Anderson reported from St. Petersburg, Florida.

As demonstrations spread from Minneapolis to the White House, New York City and overseas, federal law enforcement officials insisted far-left groups were stoking violence. Meanwhile, experts who track extremist groups also reported seeing evidence of the far-right at work. Investigators were also tracking online interference and looking into whether foreign agents were behind the effort. Officials have seen a surge of social media accounts with fewer than 200 followers created in the last month, a textbook sign of a disinformation effort. The accounts have posted graphic images of the protests, material on police brutality and material on the coronavirus pandemic that appeared designed to inflame tensions across the political divide, according to three administration officials. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss investigations. The investigations are an attempt to identify the network of forces behind some of the most widespread outbreak of civil unrest in the U.S. in decades. Protests erupted in dozens of cities in recent days, triggered by the death of George Floyd, who died after he was pinned at the neck by a white Minneapolis police officer. Pandemic-weary Americans were already angry — about COVID-19 deaths, lockdown orders and tens of millions of people out of work. The pandemic has hit African Americans harder than whites in the U.S., and the killings of black people by police have continued over the years even as the topic faded from the national stage. But there are signs of people with other disparate motives, including anarchist graffiti, arrests of some out-of-state protesters, and images circulating in extremist groups that suggest the involvement of outside groups. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said Sunday that state authorities were hit with a cyber attack as law enforcement prepared to diffuse protests in Minneapolis and St. Paul, the epicenter of the unrest. He described it as a “very sophisticated denial of service attack on all computers.” President Donald Trump, Attorney General William Bar and others have said the left-wing extremist group antifa is to blame. Short for anti-fascists, antifa is an umbrella term for far-left-leaning militant groups that resist neo-Nazis and white supremacists at demonstrations. Barr on Sunday said the FBI would use its regional joint terrorism task forces to “identify criminal organizers,” and Trump threatened again to name antifa a terrorist group. The Justice Department is also deploying members of the U.S. Marshals Service and agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration on Sunday to supplement National Guard troops outside the White House, a senior department official said. The official was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. The addition of the federal agents, who will have armored vehicles, came as Barr warned that prosecutors could seek to use terrorism statutes against “violent radical agitators” who attempt to hijack protests to cause destruction. An antifa activist group disseminated a message in a Telegram channel on Saturday that encouraged people to consider Minnesota National Guard troops “easy targets,” two Defense Department officials said. The message encouraged activists to steal “kit,” meaning the weapons and body armor used by the soldiers. The officials were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. As a result, soldiers with the Minnesota National Guard were armed during their mission at protests across the state Sunday, the officials said. The soldiers are sometimes armed but had not been since they moved into parts of the state that had been besieged by riots in the last few days. The troops do not have the authority to make arrests, and are there to act mostly as extra security for police. Others have seen evidence of right-wing extremists. J.J. MacNab, a fellow at George Washington University’s Program on Extremism, has been monitoring chatter about the protests among anti-government extremists on social media platforms. She has access to dozens of private Facebook groups for followers of the loosely organized “Boogaloo” movement, which uses an ’80s movie sequel as a code word for a second civil war. She also has been poring over images from the weekend protests and spotted some “boogaloo bois” in the crowds, carrying high-powered rifles and wearing tactical gear. “They want to co-opt them in order to start their war. They see themselves as being on the side of protesters and that the protesters themselves are useful in causing anarchy,” MacNab said. She also sees signs that the Three Percenters militia movement appears to be taking an interest. Megan Squire, an Elon University computer science professor who tracks online extremism, saw images of at least four members of the far-right Proud Boys group on the periphery of a protest Saturday night in Raleigh, North Carolina. Trump was expected in the coming days to draw distinctions between the legitimate anger of peaceful protesters and the unacceptable actions of violent agitators, said a White House official who was not authorized to discuss the plans ahead of time and spoke on condition of anonymity. The Trump administration has largely remained silent on local reports that far-right protesters were also involved. Meanwhile, Democratic mayors said Trump’s handling of the crisis was reminiscent of one of the darkest moments of his presidency — when he said there were “good people on both sides” of protests in 2017 over white supremacists demonstrating in Charlottesville, Virginia. America’s racial fault lines are a perfect opportunity for foreign adversaries looking to sow discord and portray the U.S. in a negative light, according to James Ludes, director of the Pell Center for International Relations and Public Policy at Salve Regina University in Rhode Island. “This is a real issue and Americans are legitimately upset about it,” said Ludes, who studies foreign disinformation tactics. “That’s one of the hallmarks of these campaigns. You don’t create new issues, you exploit existing issues.” There’s a history of this. In 2016, another black man, Philando Castile, was killed by police in a Minneapolis suburb, his death livestreamed on Facebook. Russians used a fake Black Lives Matter page to confuse and stoke anger among the protesters. There were nearly 700,000 followers, but it’s not clear how many were real. One debunked example from this week: That Atlanta had deployed a “child militia.” Floyd was accused of trying to pass a bad bill at a grocery store after he was laid off in the pandemic. Disturbing video showed him prone on the street, while a white police officer pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck even as he cried he couldn’t breathe. He later died. The officers have been fired; Derek Chauvin, the officer who pinned Floyd in the video, was charged with murder. At first there were peaceful demonstrations, but violence soon erupted. A Minneapolis police station was torched and protests took off around the country, growing increasingly tense. Video showed a police vehicle ramming into demonstrators in New York. Meanwhile, a van with four New York Police Department officers inside was hit with a Molotov cocktail and torched. Hundreds have been arrested nationwide and cities braced for more protests. But booking information from the county jail in Minneapolis, for example, showed that out of 59 protest-related arrests, 47 people had a home address in Minnesota, with the majority coming from the Twin Cities. Before protests began in New York City, organizers of anarchist groups began raising money for bail, recruited medical teams to deploy for violent interactions with police and planned how to target high-end stores, said John Miller, the NYPD’s deputy commissioner of intelligence and counterterrorism. Scouts on bicycles would also move ahead of the groups to report where the police would be and then direct small breakaway groups to areas where they could torch police cars or throw Molotov cocktails, Miller said. The NYPD has arrested 786 people related to protests since May 28 and 1 in 7 of them were not from New York City, he said. In Washington, where protesters raged outside the White House, most of the 17 people arrested were from the area. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser said the groups seemed, at the least, organized to destroy with tools to break windows and distribute materials.",0.0

His announcement came as police under federal command forced back peaceful demonstrators with tear gas so he could walk to a nearby church and pose with a Bible. A young boy holds a ""Justice"" sign as he peers outside the window of a car passing protesters marching through downtown for a third night of unrest Sunday May 31, 2020, in Richmond, Va. Gov. Ralph Northam issued a curfew for this evening. (AP Photo/Steve Helber) Trump's bellicose rhetoric came as the nation convulsed through another round of violence over the death of George Floyd at a time when the country is already buckling under the coronavirus outbreak and the Depression-level unemployment it has caused. The president demanded an end to the heated protests in remarks from the White House Rose Garden and vowed to use more force to achieve that aim. If governors throughout the country do not deploy the National Guard in sufficient numbers to ""dominate the streets,"" Trump said the U.S. military would step in to ""quickly solve the problem for them."" ""We have the greatest country in the world,"" the president declared. ""We're going to keep it safe."" A military deployment by Trump to U.S. states would mark a stunning federal intervention rarely seen in modern American history. Yet the message Trump appeared to be sending with the brazen pushback of protesters outside the White House was that he sees few limits to what he is willing to do. Some around the president likened the moment to 1968, when Richard Nixon ran as the law-and-order candidate in the aftermath of a summer of riots, capturing the White House. But despite his efforts to portray himself as a political outsider, Trump is an incumbent who risks being held responsible for the violence. Minutes before Trump began speaking, police and National Guard soldiers began aggressively forcing back hundreds of peaceful protesters who had gathered in Lafayette Park, across the street from the White House, where they were chanting against police brutality and Floyd's death in Minneapolis. As Trump spoke, tear gas canisters could be heard exploding. Floyd died last week after he was pinned to the pavement by a police officer who put his knee on the handcuffed black man's neck until he stopped breathing. His death set off protests that spread from Minneapolis across America. His brother Terrence pleaded with protesters on Monday to remain peaceful. Five months before Election Day, the president made clear that he would stake his reelection efforts on convincing voters that his strong-arm approach was warranted to quell the most intense civil unrest since the 1960s. He made little effort to address the grievances of black Americans and others outraged by Floyd's death and the scourge of police brutality, undermining what his campaign had hoped would be increased appeal to African American voters. The scene in and around the White House on Monday night appeared to be carefully orchestrated. As the crowd of protesters grew, Attorney General William Barr arrived in Lafayette Park to look over at the demonstrations and the swarm of law enforcement. The sudden shift in tactics against the protesters was initially a mystery. Then, after finishing his Rose Garden remarks, Trump emerged from the White House gates and walked through the park to St. John's Church, where an office had been set on fire the previous night. Trump, who rarely attends church, held up a Bible and gathered a group of advisers — all white — to pose for photos. The moment was quickly decried by Trump's critics, with New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo saying the president ""used the military to push out a peaceful protest so he could have a photo op at a church."" ""It's all just a reality TV show for this president,"" he said on Twitter. ""Shameful."" Federal law permits presidents to dispatch the military into states to suppress an insurrection or if a state is defying federal law, legal experts said. But Trump's statements also set up an immediate conflict with officials in New York and other states who asserted that the president does not have the unilateral right to send in troops against the will of local governments. The country has been beset by angry demonstrations for the past week in some of the most widespread racial unrest in the U.S. since the 1960s. Spurred largely by Floyd's death, protesters have taken to the streets to decry the killings of black people by police. Minneapolis Officer Derek Chauvin has been charged with murder, but protesters are demanding that three of his colleagues be prosecuted, too. All four were fired. While most of the demonstrations have been peaceful, others have descended into violence, leaving neighborhoods in shambles, stores ransacked, windows broken and cars burned, despite curfews around the country and the deployment of thousands of National Guard members in at least 15 states. On Monday, demonstrations erupted from Philadelphia, where hundreds of protesters spilled onto a highway in the heart of the city, to Atlanta, where police fired tear gas at demonstrators, to Nashville, where more than 60 National Guard soldiers put down their riot shields at the request of peaceful protesters who had gathered in front of Tennessee's state Capitol to honor Floyd. Two people were killed during protests in the Chicago suburb of Cicero, authorities said, but provided no details. In Louisville, Kentucky, riot police firing tear gas scattered several hundred protesters from downtown, violently capping a day of mostly peaceful protests. A vehicle plowed through a group of law enforcement officers at a demonstration in Buffalo, New York, injuring at least two. Video from the scene showed the vehicle accelerating through an intersection shortly after officers apparently tackled a protester and handcuffed him. The officers were hospitalized in stable condition, authorities said. In New York City, where nightfall has brought widespread scenes of destruction, large crowds rallied peacefully in Times Square and Brooklyn during the day. Then, in early evening, looters rushed into a Nike store in Manhattan and protesters smashed storefront windows near Rockefeller Center. Video posted on social media showed some protesters arguing with people breaking windows, urging them to stop. The city has already endured immense commercial damage from the unrest. On Monday, rioters got through the doors of the city's flagship Macy's store, famous for its Thanksgiving Day parade, and police later pulled at least two handcuffed men out of the store and put them into a van. By that time, most of the the street was littered with broken glass. In Washington, protesters continued marching peacefully through Washington hours after being forced from Lafayette park and past the 7 p.m. curfew. Eventually, within sight of the Capitol building, the marchers were turned back by law enforcement officers using tear gas, pellets and low-flying helicopters kicking up debris. As they dispersed, some protesters smashed windows at a nearby office building. Earlier Monday, Trump told the nation's governors in a video conference that they ""look like fools"" for not deploying even more National Guard troops. ""Most of you are weak,"" he said. He added: ""You've got to arrest people, you have to track people, you have to put them in jail for 10 years and you'll never see this stuff again."" Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, a Democrat, dismissed Trump's comments as the ""rantings of an insecure man trying to look strong after building his entire political career on racism."" Former Vice President Joe Biden, the Democratic presidential candidate, vowed to address institutional racism in his first 100 days in office. He met in person with black leaders in Delaware and also held a virtual meeting with big-city mayors. Biden said hate emerges ""when you have somebody in power who breathes oxygen into the hate."" In Minneapolis, meanwhile, Floyd's brother Terrence made an emotional plea for peace at the site where Floyd was arrested. ""Let's switch it up, y'all. Let's switch it up. Do this peacefully, please,"" Terrence Floyd said as he urged people to use their power at the ballot box. Also Monday, an autopsy commissioned for Floyd's family found that he died of asphyxiation from neck and back compression, the family's attorneys said. Authorities in many cities have blamed the violence on outside agitators, though have provided little evidence to back that up. But on Monday, federal authorities arrested a 28-year-old Illinois man saying he had posted self-recorded video on his Facebook page last week that showed him in Minneapolis handing out explosive devices and encouraging people to throw them at law enforcement officers. More than 5,600 people nationwide have been arrested over the past week for such offenses as stealing, blocking highways and breaking curfew, according to a count by The Associated Press. ___ Sullivan and Morrison reported from Minneapolis.

(Dakota News Now) - The violence that broke out after protests in Sioux Falls appears to have subsided, but a large law enforcement continues to monitor the situation. Mayor Paul TenHaken issued a State of Emergency Sunday night, and a curfew remains in effect until 7 a.m. Monday A peaceful protest over the death of George Floyd began around 5 p.m. in downtown Sioux Falls. Hundreds of protesters continued marching after the planned march route was concluded, meandering around Sioux Falls until they ended up at the Empire Mall around 9 p.m. At around 9:30 pm, rocks were thrown at businesses and police outside the mall. Shortly after, police in riot gear converged on the area. Glass at businesses was shattered, and Mayor TenHaken confirmed looting in the area. Police deployed tear gas multiple times over the next hour and a half. They also used rubber bullets on several protesters. At a press conference Mayor TenHaken says a group of around 700 ""bad actors"" were responsible for the violence. He characterized the day as two events, saying the peaceful protest in the evening were essentially a separate event than the violence that erupted outside the Empire Mall. He called the incident ""embarrassing."" Gov. Kristi Noem has activated the National Guard to Sioux Falls. Noem’s office says the Guard was staged and ready, deployed within minutes of the order being given, and are already on the ground. She said around 70 Guard members were activated. “South Dakota hoped for the best but prepared for the worst. We activated the National Guard the minute things turned violent in Sioux Falls,” said Governor Noem. “This is a specialized unit that is prepared for situations like this. We take protection of rights very seriously, including the right to peacefully protest, but rioting and looting will not be tolerated in South Dakota. Make no mistake, mob rule and violence do nothing to honor the memory of victims.” Police say an officer saw and heard 15-20 gunshots near T.J. Maxx during the height of the activity in the mall area. They do not know if the shots were directed at anyone. They say they are not aware of any injuries connected to the shooting. Sioux Falls police tweeted around 10:30 p.m. that they are not aware of any serious injuries. The only exception to the curfew in effect is for people going to and from work and seeking emergency services. Reports of vandalism, including damage to cars, have come in from around the mall and along 41st Street. A Dakota News Now vehicle was vandalized while parked at the Empire Mall. Windows were broken on several 41st Street businesses, including Chicos, Verizon, and Riddles Jewelry. Anyone with specific information about crimes connected to the events Sunday night are asked to call Crime Stoppers at 367-7007.",0.0

An hour before an 11 p.m. curfew ordered by Mayor Muriel Bowser, police fired a major barrage of tear gas stun grenades into the crowd of more than 1,000 people, largely clearing Lafayette Park across the street from the White House and scattering protesters into the street. Protesters piled up road signs and plastic barriers and lit a raging fire in the middle of H Street. Some pulled an American flag from a nearby building and threw it into the blaze. Others added branches pulled from trees. A cinder block structure, on the north side of the park, that had bathrooms and a maintenance office, was engulfed in flames. As the curfew hit, police sealed the perimeter of the park. Shortly beforehand, police pushed a crowd of about 300 demonstrators several blocks with a series of charges with batons and riot shields. Enraged protesters screamed, ""Who do you serve? Who do you protect?"" Police shot pepper powders point black at several protesters. CBS News confirmed that President Trump was briefly brought to the White House bunker Friday night after protests erupted near the White House. The Palm Beach Post reports that the demonstrations outside the White House spurred additional security measures outside the president's Mar-a-Lago resot in Palm Beach, Florida. Back in Washington, there was a fire Sunday night in the headquarters of the AFL-CIO. Several miles north, a separate protest broke out in Northwest D.C., near the Maryland border. The Metropolitan Police Department says there were break-ins at a Target and a shopping center that houses Neiman Marcus, Saks Fifth Avenue Men's Store, T.J. Maxx, a movie theater and specialty stores. Police say several individuals have been detained. Among the fires was one in the basement of the historic St. John's Episcopal Church. It was quickly extinguished by firefighters who arrived under police escort, according to The Washington Post. The entire Washington, D.C., National Guard - roughly 1,700 soldiers – was activated to help with the response to protests outside the White House and elsewhere in the nation's capital, according to two Defense Department officials speaking to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity. Bowser said Sunday she requested 500 Guardsman to assist local law enforcement. Later on Sunday, as the protests escalated, Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy ordered the rest of the Guardsman - about 1,200 soldiers - to report, the AP said.",0.0

The turbulence sparked by the death of George Floyd — a black man who died after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed a knee into his neck for several minutes — shook not only the streets of New York and Los Angeles, but dozens of smaller communities such as Fargo, North Dakota, and Lincoln, Nebraska. The damage extended even to buildings near the White House. ""They keep killing our people,"" said Mahira Louis, 15, who marched with her mother and several hundred others through downtown Boston on Sunday. ""I'm so sick and tired of it."" Peaceful protests involving tens of thousands of people on Saturday gave way, in some places, to violence, with police vehicles torched, stores emptied and objects hurled at officers. The police response varied from restrained to aggressive, with officers at times firing tear gas and rubber bullets. Police and peaceful protesters alike pleaded for a stop to violence, saying it weakened calls for justice and reform. ""It only hurts the cause,"" said Danielle Outlaw, head of the police force in Philadelphia, where more than 200 people were arrested as fires and looting engulfed the heart of the city. Disgust over generations of racism in a country founded by slaveholders combined with a string of recent racially charged killings to stoke the anger. Adding to that was angst from months of lockdowns brought on by the coronavirus pandemic, which has disproportionately hurt communities of color, not only in terms of infections but in job losses and economic stress. The droves of people congregating for demonstrations threatened to trigger new outbreaks, a fact overshadowed by the boiling tensions. ""Maybe this country will get the memo that we are sick of police murdering unarmed black men,"" said Lex Scott, founder of Black Lives Matter Utah. ""Maybe the next time a white police officer decides to pull the trigger, he will picture cities burning."" The scale of the protests, sweeping from coast to coast and unfolding on a single night, rivaled the historic demonstrations of the civil rights and Vietnam War eras. Curfews were imposed in major cities around the U.S., including Atlanta, Chicago, Denver, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Seattle. About 5,000 National Guard soldiers and airmen were activated in 15 states and Washington, D.C. In Minneapolis, police, state troopers and National Guard members showed new force Saturday in breaking up demonstrations after three days of police largely avoiding engaging protesters. Dozens of protests were underway or expected Sunday, from Miami to Kansas City to San Francisco. They went forth largely without incident, but sparks of crime continued. In Philadelphia, people robbed stores in broad daylight, and at least one more police vehicle was set ablaze. Streets leading downtown were closed. Chicago likewise restricted downtown access and called in the National Guard. At the Minneapolis intersection where Floyd was killed, people gathered with brooms and flowers, saying it was important to protect what they called a ""sacred space."" The intersection was blocked with the traffic cones while a ring of flowers was laid out. Among those descending on Minneapolis was Michael Brown Sr., the father of Michael Brown, whose killing by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, set off unrest in 2014. ""I understand what this family is feeling. I understand what this community is feeling,"" he said. County Commissioner Angela Conley said the demonstrations and confrontations with police would continue until the other three officers who were at the scene when Floyd was pinned down are arrested and prosecuted. The officer who held his knee on Floyd's neck, Derek Chauvin, was charged last week with murder. All four officers have been fired. ""We'll continue to have this militarized presence in our community until justice is done,"" Conley said. In tweets Sunday, President Donald Trump blamed anarchists and the media for fueling the violence. Attorney General William Barr pointed a finger at ""far left extremist"" groups. Police chiefs and politicians accused outsiders of coming in and causing the problems. Few parts of America were untouched. Protesters set fires inside Reno's city hall, and police launched tear gas at rock-throwing demonstrators in Fargo, North Dakota. In Salt Lake City, demonstrators flipped a police car and lit it on fire. Police said six people were arrested and an officer was injured after being struck in the head with a baseball bat. By Sunday, the fury had spread to Europe, where thousands gathered in London's Trafalgar Square, clapping and waving placards despite government rules barring crowds because of the COVID-19 pandemic. In New York, a video Saturday showed two police cruisers lurching into a crowd of demonstrators who were pushing a barricade against one of them and pelting it with objects. Several people were knocked to the ground. It was unclear if anyone was hurt. ""The mistakes that are happening are not mistakes. They're repeated violent terrorist offenses, and people need to stop killing black people,"" Brooklyn protester Meryl Makielski said. In Indianapolis, two people were reported dead in bursts of downtown violence, adding to deaths reported in Detroit and Minneapolis in recent days. Buildings around the U.S. were defaced with spray-painted messages, from the facade of St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York to the historic Hay-Adams hotel near the White House. Some of Floyd's gasped last words — ""I can't breathe"" — were repeated, alongside anti-police messages. Crews near the White House worked to replace windows that had been shattered with large pieces of wood. Buildings for blocks were marked with graffiti, including curses about Trump. Shattered glass still covered the sidewalks. The damaged buildings included the Department of Veterans Affairs, directly across the street from the White House. Some leaders prepared to put more soldiers in the streets. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp authorized the deployment of up to 3,000 National Guard troops to Athens, Savannah and any other cities where more demonstrations were planned. Kemp had already approved up to 1,500 Guardsmen to help enforce a 9 p.m. Saturday curfew in Atlanta. This week's unrest recalled the riots in Los Angeles nearly 30 years ago after the acquittal of the white police officers who beat Rodney King, a black motorist who had led them on a high-speed chase. The protests of Floyd's killing have gripped many more cities, but the losses have yet to approach the staggering totals LA saw during five days of rioting in 1992, when more than 60 people died, 2,000-plus were injured and thousands arrested, with property damage topping $1 billion.",0.0

""This can be kind of a tinderbox for COVID,"" the 39-year-old venture capitalist said after attending a demonstration in Florida, one of many around the country sparked by the death of George Floyd, a black man who died after he was pinned at the neck by a white Minneapolis police officer. As more beaches, churches, mosques, schools and businesses reopened worldwide, the sudden and mass civil unrest in the United States is raising fears of new virus outbreaks in a country that has more confirmed infections and deaths than any other. And it's not just in the U.S. — London hosted a large anti-racism protest Sunday where demonstrators violated social distancing rules. Rosa Jimenez Cano said she planned to self-quarantine for 14 days, worrying she was perhaps ""irresponsible"" when she attended Saturday night's protest in Miami, where she exposed herself to crowds of people. Protests over Floyd's death — the latest in a series of killings of black men and women at the hands of police in America — have shaken the country from Minneapolis to New York, from Atlanta to Los Angeles. Some turned into riots and clashes with police, leaving stores in flames and torched cars in the streets. Health experts fear that silent carriers of the virus could unwittingly infect others at protests where people are packed cheek to jowl, many without masks, many chanting, singing or shouting. The virus is dispersed by microscopic droplets in the air when people cough, sneeze, sing or talk. ""There's no question that, when you put hundreds or thousands of people together in close proximity, when we have got this virus all over the streets ... it's not healthy,"" Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan said Sunday on CNN's ""State of the Union."" ""Two weeks from now across America, we're going to find out whether or not this gives us a spike and drives the numbers back up again or not."" The U.S. has seen over 1.7 million infections and nearly 104,000 deaths in the pandemic, which has disproportionately affected racial minorities in a nation that does not have universal health care. Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser said Sunday she was very concerned that the protests in the nation's capital and elsewhere could provide fertile ground for a new series of outbreaks. Many of the protesters were wearing masks, but there were no attempts at social distancing. ""We've been working very hard in these last eight to 10 weeks to not have any mass gatherings,"" she said. ""As a nation, we have to be concerned about a rebound."" Even the many protesters wearing masks are not guaranteed protection. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says cloth masks keep infected people from spreading the virus but are not designed to protect wearers from getting it. Mass protests in connection with Floyd's death were also being held in Europe. In London, thousands of people marched Sunday chanting ""No justice! No peace!"" while carrying signs reading ""Justice for George Floyd"" and ""Racism is a global issue."" Many demonstrators were not wearing masks and most in the crowd at Trafalgar Square were packed closely together. Britain has seen nearly 38,500 virus deaths, the second-highest in the world after the United States. In Berlin, hundreds of protesters picketed outside the U.S. Embassy on Saturday night under the motto: ""Justice for George Floyd."" Others marched near the U.S. embassy in Copenhagen, Denmark. Many Americans returned Sunday to in-person church services for the first time in weeks and tens of thousands of mosques reopened across the Middle East, but countries from India to Colombia still saw rising numbers of new infections. Nearly 6.1 million infections have been reported worldwide, with nearly 370,000 people dying, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. The true death toll is believed to be significantly higher, since many victims died of the virus without ever being tested. The situation worsened Sunday in India, where new daily cases topped 8,000 for the first time and 193 more deaths were reported. Despite that, India still is easing restrictions on shops and public transport in more states beginning Monday, although subways and schools will remain closed. In Saudi Arabia, mosques reopened Sunday for the first time in more than two months, but Islam's holiest site in Mecca remained closed. In Jerusalem, throngs of worshippers waited outside the Al-Aqsa Mosque before it reopened. Many wore surgical masks and waited for temperature checks as they entered. In Bogota, the capital of Colombia, authorities were locking down an area of nearly 1.5 million people as cases continued to rise. Mayor Claudia Lopez said no one in the working-class Kennedy area — inaugurated by the late U.S. President John F. Kennedy in 1961 — will be allowed out, except to seek food or medical care or in case of an emergency. Factories must also close. In Spain, Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez said Sunday that he would ask Parliament for a final two-week extension of the nation's state of emergency that is set to expire on June 7. That allows the government to keep ordering lockdown measures to control its coronavirus outbreak, which has claimed at least 27,000 lives, many of them in overwhelmed nursing homes. ""We have almost reached safe harbor,"" Sánchez said. At the Vatican, Pope Francis cautioned people against being pessimistic as they emerge from coronavirus lockdowns.

The protests over George Floyd's death hit the nation's capital Friday night as angry protesters arrived at Pennsylvania Avenue, leading to a lockdown at the White House. Outside the White House on Friday, Secret Service could be seen after 7 p.m. taking at least one person into custody. Videos showed a large group of protesters gathering, with some burning flags and knocking over barricades. There were also some violent encounters. The president remained there about an hour before returning to the residence, according to a Republican close to the White House and an administration official who spoke to the Associated Press on the condition of anonymity. It is currently unknown whether first lady Melania Trump and their son, Barron, were with the president but the family has been shaken by the size and venom of the crowds, AP reported. ""The White House does not comment on security protocols and decisions,” said White House spokesman Judd Deere. The Secret Service said it does not discuss the means and methods of its protective operations. Officials told The New York Times, which first reported the story, they never believed Trump was in danger but took the precaution of moving him to the bunker as tensions escalated. Trump has told advisers he worries about his safety, while both privately and publicly praising the work of the Secret Service, according to the AP. Floyd, an unarmed black man, died in Minneapolis police custody this week after a white officer pinned him to the ground under his knee. His death has sparked demonstrations against police brutality and racial discrimination in cities across the United States. Trump praised the Secret Service and said he “watched every move” from inside the White House during Friday's protest and that he “couldn't have felt more safe.” ""They let the ‘protesters’ scream & rant as much as they wanted, but whenever someone got too frisky or out of line, they would quickly come down on them, hard – didn’t know what hit them,"" he said Saturday. Trump continued, ""The front line was replaced with fresh agents, like magic. Big crowd, professionally organized, but nobody came close to breaching the fence. If they had, they would have been greeted with the most vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons, I have ever seen. That’s when people would have been really badly hurt, at least."" He also claimed DC Mayor Muriel Bowser didn't allow DC police to ""get involved"" and assist Secret Service, though Secret Service later said they were on the scene. Bowser, a Democrat, said on Twitter the city's police department would protect everyone regardless of whether the mayor agreed with them. ""While he hides behind his fence afraid/alone, I stand w/ people peacefully exercising their First Amendment Right after the murder of #GeorgeFloyd & hundreds of years of institutional racism There are no vicious dogs & ominous weapons. There is just a scared man,"" she wrote. This is the same bunker Vice President Dick Cheney was brought after the September 11 attacks when authorities feared a hijacked plane hijacked was heading toward the White House. President George W. Bush, when he returned to D.C. later that evening, was later taken there after a false alarm of another plane. The recent protests have led to one of the highest alerts at the White House complex since those attacks.",0.0

Stern said he's been personally invested in downtown Fargo for years, and needed to come help clean up. ""It is my town,"" Stern said. ""I grew up here."" Owners of buildings where windows were damaged started to clear all broken glass in preparation for the repairs for weeks to come. Besides the glass, rocks and debris, volunteers said the air had other reminders of last night. ""When you are working in a tighter space, it is burning in your throat,"" said Jennifer Chalupnik as she described the tear gas lingering in the air from last night. It was first deployed at 8 p.m. by Fargo police officers. City officials worked alongside community members to clear the debris. ""The city of Fargo came in with front end loaders, trucks and street sweepers (to clear the debris),"" Chalupnik said. In fact, both city officials and community volunteers felt motivated to preserve the beauty of downtown Fargo. ""We are down to clean up, to help restore this place, because this is the place we love,"" said Erik Kiesz. Only a short two hours after the cleanup started, volunteers completed the process.

More than 4,400 arrests have been made at protests nationwide since viral video emerged showing former Minneapolis Officer Derek Chauvin holding his knee to Floyd's neck for more than eight minutes on Memorial Day, resulting in Floyd's death. Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo apologized to Floyd's family Sunday, saying that firing Chauvin and the other three officers involved in the incident was the right thing to do. Peaceful protests continued to be marred by violence. The Minneapolis Department of Public safety confirmed a semi-truck drove into a group of peaceful protesters on Interstate 35. The driver of the truck was taken into custody, but not before protesters pulled him from the truck's cab. The driver was taken to the hospital with minor injuries. Elsewhere, vandalism and looting continued across the country, as did the use of tear gas and rubber bullets by police in confrontations with protesters. Reports: President Trump hustled to bunker amid Washington protests President Donald Trump was briefly moved to the White House's underground bunker Friday night to shelter in place as the protest grew outside the Executive Mansion, according to multiple outlets. The protests over George Floyd's death hit the nation's capital Friday night as angry protesters arrived at Pennsylvania Avenue, leading to a lockdown at the White House. Dozens of Secret Service agents were injured in clashes with protesters over the weekend, and videos showed a large group of protesters – some burning flags and knocking over barricades.

Bottoms and police Chief Erika Shields made the announcement at a press conference after reviewing body-camera footage. ""We understand that our officers are working very long hours under an enormous amount of stress,"" Bottoms said. ""But we also understand that the use of excessive force is never acceptable."" – Jessica Flores At least 4,400 arrests since George Floyd's death: AP data At least 4,400 people nationwide have been arrested over days of protests since George Floyd’s death on Memorial Day, according to a tally compiled by The Associated Press. About 150 people were arrested in Minnesota after violating curfew amid protests Sunday night, the Minnesota Department of Public Safety tweeted. DPS continued to tweet about arrests late into the night and added, ""Even peaceful protesters who are breaking curfew are subject to arrest. Please go home and stay there."" DPS announced the arrests of more than 155 people Saturday night across multiple agencies. A dozen firearms were confiscated between the State Patrol and the Minneapolis Police Department. Historic St. John's Church near White House set ablaze amid DC protests As protesters gathered near the White House, flames were seen at Washington, D.C., landmark that bills itself as ""the church of the presidents."" The fire, apparently an act of arson, was in the basement of St. John's Church, across from the White House, The Washington Post reported, and was extinguished. It occurred as a demonstration was taking place outside. The gathering had attracted as many as 1,000 Sunday, who faced off against officers in riot gear. The Episcopalian church in Lafayette Square boasts on its website that every U.S. president since James Madison has attended services. Consecrated in 1816, the church also says the bell in its steeple, weighing almost 1,000 pounds, was cast in 1822 by Paul Revere's son Joseph.

The communities of Tinley Park, Crestwood and Oak Lawn alerted residents to stay home due to civil unrest. Many businesses boarded up. Gov. J.B. Pritzker said he activated 375 Illinois National Guard soldiers to assist local law enforcement with street closures. ""This has been a scary and unsettling time, but I know we will get through this and begin the process of healing together,"" Lightfoot said in a midnight Twitter post. ""Please stay safe, and stay home."" Minneapolis police chief: George Floyd's death 'a violation of humanity' Minneapolis Police Department Chief Medaria Arradondo told CNN that George Floyd's death was ""a violation of humanity."" Speaking at the site where Floyd died after fired police officer Derek Chauvin held his knee to Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes, Arradondo apologized to Floyd's family and said he had a ""visceral"" and ""emotional"" reaction to the video that has sparked outrage across the nation. “There are absolute truths in life,"" Arradondo told CNN. ""We need air to breathe. ... I did not need days or weeks or months or processes or bureaucracies to tell me what occurred out here last Monday, it was wrong.” When asked why he fired the four officers involved in the incident that led to Floyd's death, Arradondo said: ""In my mind, this was a violation of humanity. This was a violation of the oath the majority of the men and women that put this uniform on — this goes absolutely against it. This goes contrary to what we believe in.""

In the video, the people vandalize three police vehicles, smashing windows and hitting and kicking the vehicles. One of the people opens a door to the SUV and those at the scene start lighting things inside of it on fire. Police eventually got to the scene and began pushing back protesters as the vehicles burned behind them. Minnesota AG Keith Ellison to lead prosecution of Derek Chauvin Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz announced Sunday that state Attorney General Keith Ellison will lead the prosecution in the Floyd case. Ellison called the case “unusual because of the way that Mr. Floyd was killed and who did it — at the hands of the defendant who was a Minneapolis police officer.” He said he expects to work together with Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman on the case. Ellison didn’t announce additional charges for Chauvin or charges for the three other officers involved in the incident. He added “prosecuting police officers for misconduct, including homicide and murder, is very difficult.” “Every single link in the prosecutorial chain will come under attack as we present this case to a jury or a fact finder and we need to make sure that we be absolutely prepared.

1622408108,2020-06-01 11:08:35,What is antifa and what does the movement want?,https://www.devilslakejournal.com/zz/news/20200601/what-is-antifa-and-what-does-movement-want?rssfeed=true,en,False,,344728,devilslakejournal.com,http://devilslakejournal.com/,"Antifa — short for ""anti-fascist"" — is the name for loosely affiliated, left-leaning anti-racist groups that monitor and track the activities of local neo-Nazis. The movement has no unified structure or national leadership but has emerged in the form of local bodies nationwide, particularly on the West Coast. Some of the groups, such as the 10-year-old Rose City Antifa in Portland, the oldest antifa group in the U.S., are particularly well-organized and active online and on Facebook, while its members are individually anonymous. President Trump has singled out antifa as part of what he calls the alt-left in his initial claim that ""many sides"" were to blame for violence in Charlottesville the weekend of Aug. 12, not just the neo-Nazis, KKK and white nationalists. How is it pronounced? ""AN-tifa"" with the emphasis on the first syllable, which sounds more like ""on"" in English than ""an."" When did it start? Anti-fascist groups, particularly in Europe, have been around for many decades, notably in Italy, against Mussolini, and in Germany, against Hitler. In the postwar period, antifa groups resurged to fight neo-Nazi groups, particularly in Germany. In the U.S., the anti-fascist movements grew out of leftist politics of the late '80s, primarily under the umbrella of Anti-Racist Action. What does the movement want? The primary goal is to stop neo-Nazis and white supremacists from gaining a platform rather than to promote a specific antifa agenda. The antifa groups are decidedly anti-racist, anti-sexist and anti-homophobia, but also by and large socially leftist and anti-capitalist. How do the groups operate? Mark Bray, a lecturer and Dartmouth and author of the new book Antifa: The Antifascist Handbook, says the groups ""organize educational campaigns, build community coalitions, monitor fascists, pressure venues to cancel their events, organize self-defense trainings and physically confront the far right when necessary."" A main goal is to try to deny fascists a public forum, which is why they turn out in numbers to physically confront neo-Nazis, the KKK and white supremacists at public demonstrations. They also step in to protect counter-protesters at such events. In addition, antifa is particularly active in ""doxxing,"" or identifying neo-Nazis and like-minded individuals and disseminating that private information to the public and employers to discourage people from joining their ranks. Is antifa violent? Members pointedly do not eschew violence but rather see themselves as engaging in ""self-defense,"" protecting other protesters and primarily confronting neo-Nazis and white supremacists to deny them a platform to publicly spread their views. ""We are unapologetic about the reality that fighting fascism at points requires physical militancy,” Rose City Antifa’s Facebook page reads. “Anti-fascism is, by nature, a form of self-defense: the goal of fascism is to exterminate the vast majority of human beings.” Political activist and author Cornel West, speaking to Amy Goodman on the program Democracy Now about the clashes in Charlottesville, said antifa intervened when the ""neofascists"" move against his group of protesters. ""We would have been crushed like cockroaches if it were not for the anarchists and the anti-fascists,"" he said. Bray says the rise of fascism in the 1930s demonstrates that it was a mistake to allow such groups to air their views in hopes that public opinion would blunt their growth. ""We should be wary of those who are more distressed about alleged violations of the speech of fascists than the actual violence they perpetrate,"" he says. Where has the movement demonstrated? In addition to Charlottesville, antifa forces, who often dress in black and wear masks, have confronted or clashed with far-right groups in such places as the University of California at Berkeley, where protests by West Coast antifa forces, some of whom smashed windows and set fires, forced the cancellation of a speech by alt-right activist Milo Yiannopoulos in February and another by conservative commentator Ann Coulter in April. In June, antifa forces turned out to protest a pro-Trump free-speech in Portland. Some antifa counterprotesters began throwing objects at police, who responded with flash grenades and pepper balls, according to the The Oregonian. Antifa was also out in force in June to confront Patriot Prayer, a free speech group protesting “political correctness and hatred” at Evergreen State College in Olympia, Wash.",0.0

(AP) — Joe Biden vowed to address institutional racism in his first 100 days in office as he sought to elevate his voice Monday in the exploding national debate over racism and police brutality. Former Vice President Joe Biden bows his head in prayer as he visits Bethel AME Church in Wilmington, Del., Monday, June 1, 2020. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik) The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee offered emotional support and promised bold action during an in-person discussion with black leaders in Delaware and a subsequent virtual meeting with big-city mayors who are grappling with racial tensions and frustrated by a lack of federal support. ""Hate just hides. It doesn't go away, and when you have somebody in power who breathes oxygen into the hate under the rocks, it comes out from under the rocks,"" Biden told more than a dozen African American leaders gathered at a church in downtown Wilmington, his face mask lowered around his chin as he spoke. Without offering specifics, he promised to ""deal with institutional racism"" and set up a police oversight body in his first 100 days in office, if elected. The former vice president also said he'd be releasing an economic plan focused on education, housing and ""access to capital"" and investments, especially for minority Americans, later this month. ""I really do believe that the blinders have been taken off. I think this tidal wave is moving,"" Biden told the mayors of Atlanta, Chicago, Los Angeles and St. Paul, Minnesota. ""I realize we've got to do something big, we can do it, and everyone will benefit from it."" Largely sheltering in place amid the coronavirus, Biden has struggled in recent weeks to be heard from his makeshift home TV studio over the noise of dueling national crises. But after another night of violent protests, he ventured out into public for the second time in two days and just the third time since the pandemic arrived in mid-March. His hopeful and collaborative approach marked a sharp contrast to that of President Donald Trump, who has made little effort to unify the country. The Republican president slammed governors as ""weak"" during a video teleconference on Monday and demanded tougher crackdowns on protesters. Trump also lashed out at Biden on Twitter, writing that ""Sleepy Joe Biden's people are so Radical Left that they are working to get the Anarchists out of jail, and probably more."" Biden's softer style may foreshadow how he presents himself in the five months before the presidential election, emphasizing calm and competence as a contrast to a mercurial president. It is an approach that carries the risk of being drowned out by Trump's much louder voice. On Monday evening, Trump declared himself ""the president of law and order"" from the White House as military police and law enforcement fired tear gas and cleared protesters from nearby Lafayette Park. Biden made no mention of the unfolding events during an online fundraiser that took place at the same time, though he talked at length about persistent racism in the U.S. He plans to deliver remarks on the unrest gripping the U.S. on Tuesday in Philadelphia. In the early moments of Monday's gathering at the Bethel AME church in Wilmington, Biden listened quietly and took notes. All the attendees, including Biden, wore face masks but lowered them as they spoke. ""The vice president came to hear from us. This is a homeboy,"" pastor Sylvester Beaman said before everyone bowed their heads in prayer. Biden's standing with the black community weighs heavily as he works to deny Trump a second term. African Americans rescued Biden's flailing primary campaign, but it's unclear if they will turn out for him in large numbers in November. ""I want to make something clear. I don't expect anything from the black community,"" Biden said Monday, insisting he has never taken its support for granted. The former vice president has been doing cleanup since telling a prominent black radio host a week and a half ago that African Americans who back Trump ""ain't black."" Yet the mayors who spoke with Biden, three of whom are black, were clearly frustrated and angry with Trump, who has offered military support to address violent protests while denying them federal support to address the coronavirus fallout and repeatedly attacking them on social media. ""To see the president of the United States say that he's going to send the military into our communities but hadn't mentioned sending a single dime of support into our communities, speaks to where we are in America,"" said Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms. Much of Biden's campaign strategy centers on trying to draw a contrast with Trump on temperament and values. He has called the White House contest a battle for the soul of the nation and has been particularly forceful in condemning Trump's handling of moments of racial tension. In an election that is likely to be a referendum on the sitting president, some Biden aides say privately that the best plan may be to let Trump do himself in. Yet there is also a recognition that Biden needs to do more than simply wait for voters who may be turned off by Trump to turn toward him. Some Democrats who have criticized Biden for not being more visible during the onset of the coronavirus said he is making the right moves now. ""I'm sure they have some reluctance, understandably, right now to politicize it. That's not who he is,"" said Democratic strategist James Carville. ""There might be a time for eloquence, but I think that simplicity is eloquence right now."" ___ Jaffe reported from Washington; Peoples reported from Montclair, New Jersey.

A few people at the front of the protest act badly, throwing rocks or water bottles, and then the entire crowd is gassed. When that happens, chaos ensues because people flee blindly. A small minority act out destructively, and things go downhill from there. People standing on the sidewalk Saturday were gassed when they failed to disperse. They could not understand the garbled announcements given by the police, and only understood that they were to be chemically assaulted when the officers started to put on their gas masks. Then people who were peacefully exercising their Constitutional rights started to panic and run away. Some young idiots did what young idiots do, and acted destructively. This was inevitable. Chemically assault a large enough group of people indiscriminately, and some of them will act badly. The use of tear gas to disperse protesters, the majority of them peaceful, has to stop. We've seen it to turn to violence time and time again. We saw it in Ferguson years ago, and we're seeing it all over the country now. The police have to find a new tactic.

Smoke continued to waft in the air 24 hours after people protesting the death of George Floyd lit fire to Moore's storefront, and several others along Lake Street. ""My business burned down two days ago, you see the flames? It's still going,"" Moore, 41, said Sunday. ""That flame down in people's soul? It's still going. They want justice."" She is among dozens of Minneapolis and St. Paul business owners, small and large, trying to rebuild after fiery riots and demonstrations in the Twin Cities on Thursday and Friday. Her company, ""Levels,"" which also has a St. Paul location that remains undamaged, was Moore's ""baby."" Moore, a black woman, said she started the business from the trunk of her car once she left a job with Minneapolis Public Schools in 2011 to pursue her passion for fashion and music. It had been opened for five years before people broke in Friday and started a fire that destroyed her business and several adjacent stores. When she was alerted to the break-in, Moore went to Lake Street and watched nearly a decade of work collapse into the concrete. ""I'm hurt that I lost this. But ... I can't cry right now,"" she said. ""I can't go home and cry and be hurt because I lost businesses. George Floyd lost his life. He'll never be here again."" She's confident she can recover but isn't sure if she can rebuild at the same location — in the heart of a diverse southside neighborhood. A GoFundMe has been started to help with those expenses. Other small businesses face similar uncertainty, but several fundraisers have been started to help support Minneapolis' littlest companies. As looters ransacked his St. Paul store, this business owner hid in the bathroom and whispered to 911 In St. Paul's Midway neighborhood, just blocks from where Moore's second Levels location was protected by armed men standing on its porch, one business owner said he hid in his office as people ransacked, urinated in and damaged the building. Jim Segal closed Ax-Man Surplus earlier than normal Thursday afternoon because daylight looting took hold at the nearby intersection of University and Snelling avenues. After sending customers and employees home and locking the front door, Segal said he continued to work in the office of the six-decade-old company. Then he heard multiple glass windows break. ""Luckily, I have a steel door because they were trying to enter the office,"" said Segal, who bought the surplus store about 20 years ago. ""I don't think they knew anybody was in there, but I basically barricaded myself within a bathroom inside the office."" He felt as if he were in a movie, the St. Paul native said. As display cases were shattered and electronics taken from inside his store, he whispered to 911 dispatch asking for help. ""Police said, 'Don't even bother boarding up your store,'"" Segal said Saturday. ""'There's a 50/50 chance it won't be here tomorrow."" About 6:30 p.m. Thursday, he returned to the St. Paul Ax-Man location, one of three in the metro, in an unsuccessful effort to shoo away people running in and out of his store. A company agreed to board up his windows, Segal said, but left quickly after arriving, not wanting to work amongst the crowd. He tried to get a license plate of someone stealing, but others tried to take his phone so he retreated to his car. Segal sat in his vehicle for hours as rioters peed in his store and took items ranging from knick-knacks and DVDs to a snow-blower. He said coronavirus concerns forced him to close his business for the better part of two months. They'd been reopened a little more than a week when the building was ransacked. ""I don't recall ever being in a situation where I was that panicked. I was petrified, actually,"" he said. Ax-Man won't reopen for at least a week or two, and Segal fears it may close permanently because of the lack of sales during the spring. That would mean a loss of livelihood for him and about 10 employees. He sympathizes with those upset about Floyd's death in police custody on Memorial Day, describing the video of Minneapolis police officers' actions ""horrific."" ""This is just stuff, no comparison (to a person dying),"" said Segal, a white man. ""But what I'm disappointed about is the lack of leadership in the government — Mayor (Melvin) Carter, Mayor (Jacob) Frey, Gov. (Tim) Walz — to just allow lawlessness. ""Indefensible what happened to Mr. Floyd, but this doesn't make it better. And I don't know what does."" Insurance helps small business owners, but a full recovery is 'a lot more complicated' While Moore and Segal both said they are insured, they don't believe insurance alone will enough to replace everything they've lost. People typically see business owner and think ""wealth,"" Segal said. ""That's not true for me,"" he said. ""I'm the last one to get paid."" Understanding insurance policies can be difficult for many small business owners, said Allison Sharkey, executive director of the Lake Street Council, which supports local companies. Lake Street has always been an area for Minneapolis's immigrant entrepreneurs to start businesses, she said, and many of those folks may not be familiar with aid systems or insurance proceedings. ""There's a lot of detail to go through in your contract that most people don't really understand until a situation like this happens,"" Sharkey said. ""It's a lot more complicated than just paying a $500 deductible and thinking the rest is going to be covered."" Minority business owners may not have the credit or assets to withstand closures as long as white business owners with more resources, she said. The council, and other metro business associations like it, try to fill that gap and provide guidance, but insurance claims won't stop some businesses from completely fading away. For Moore, she's frustrated when people bring up the fact she's insured because it ignores the work she put into the building and the items she won't get back. ""When you get it out the mud — meaning when you get it on your own, no handouts ... someone just handing you money doesn't equate,"" she said. ""It's deeper than that."" Financial support is coming for Twin Cities small businesses left in rubble amid George Floyd protests When Segal returned to his business Friday, he found a person who lived nearby sweeping glass from the sidewalk, which raised his spirits. Monetary support has begun, too. It's especially vital, small business advocates say, because many companies were already running out of money because of closures due to COVID-19. The Lake Street Council has received over $1.5 million to help support the hundreds of businesses that line the heavily damaged area. Sharkey said companies owned by people of color and immigrants have been especially affected by the days of unrest. Several ""big, beautiful"" buildings on the southside have been replaced by rubble, which will be eventually replaced by vacant lots. ""($1.5 million) sounds like a big number, but we're gonna need a lot more government and nonprofit support,"" Sharkey said. ""We have a long road ahead of us."" She said her organization had already begun to save money to distribute to companies dealing with financial contractions from the coronavirus, but it's not been shifted to riot recovery. The council will request an aid package from the state, but Sharkey thinks they'll need federal dollars as well. ""We're headed toward a recession,"" she said. ""We're really going to have to create a long-term strategy along with stakeholders, business owners, property owners business groups, elected officials."" Donations to that fund can be made here. Fundraising has begun in Segal's area, as well. The Hamline Midway Coalition has received more than $75,000 to help aid small businesses in their recovery from property damage and lost sales. Kate Mudge, the coalition's director, said the organization has been raising funds to help small and minority business owners worried about gentrification and corporatization coming with the new U.S. soccer stadium built nearby. ""We already have been dealing with a pandemic, we've been dealing with some long-term issues in our community, and this is the icing on the cake. We hope that this is gonna bring new people to Midway, new businesses,"" she said. ""We've dealt with worse."" Donations to the Midway fund can be made at here. Despite the uncertainty, the organizations are confident many businesses will survive if community support keeps up. ""I'm not blaming people, you can't judge anybody's pain or anger. Everyone acts and reacts to things in different ways,"" Moore said. ""I have a black-owned business, it was burned down and we were protesting, for a black man's life that was taken. So, I was just a little confused on where we're going with this. But, at the end of the day, everything is about sacrifices.""",0.0

Most demonstrations, some attracting hundreds of people, were peaceful though violence, including the burning of police vehicles and looting, prompted police in some cities to deploy tear gas to gain control of the crowd. Early in the day, volunteers turned out in many cities to sweep up debris from businesses that had been burned, had their windows broken or were otherwise damaged Saturday. Here's a look at how protests are unfolding around the country on Sunday: Washington, D.C.: Historic St. John's Church near White House set ablaze As protesters gathered near the White House, flames were seen at the Washington, D.C., landmark that bills itself as ""the church of the presidents."" The fire, apparently an act of arson, was in the basement of St. John's Church, across from the White House, The Washington Post reported, and was extinguished. It occurred as a demonstration was taking place outside. The gathering had attracted as many as 1,000 Sunday, who faced off against officers in riot gear. The Episcopalian church in Lafayette Square boasts on its website that every U.S. president since James Madison has attended services there. Consecrated in 1816, the church also says the bell in its steeple, weighing almost 1,000 pounds, was cast in 1822 by Paul Revere's son Joseph. New York City: Protesters force closure of Manhattan Bridge; street fires, looting A crucial bridge into Manhattan was closed Sunday to make way for protesters, a day after hundreds of arrests including the mayor's daughter, it was reported. Street fires were being set and sporadic looting was reported Sunday evening after a day that saw large groups of protesters walk from Brooklyn to Manhattan over the Manhattan Bridge, which had to be closed, ABC7 in New York reported. Mayor Bill de Blasio's daughter Chiara, 25, was among 345 arrested, the station reported based on unnamed NYPD sources. The Daily Mail said it was able to confirm the arrest from a police report. She was reportedly arrested as part of a group of 100 demonstrators who refused to leave a roadway when ordered by police. Seattle: National Guard called to Bellevue; protesters block Interstate 5 National Guard troops were ordered to the Seattle suburb of Bellevue after reports of widespread looting. Washington Gov. Jay Inslee ordered 200 National Guard members to Bellevue after the mayor declared an emergency due to violence. Rioters broke into the Bellevue Mall and were stealing goods from stores. The thefts were part of a day of protests in the Seattle area that included shutting down Interstate 5, the same freeway that San Diego demonstrators blocked more than 1,000 miles away in southern California. Chicago: Gov. JB Pritzker activates National Guardsmen to assist police Vandalism reports continued to crop up in several city neighborhoods and some suburbs. The communities of Tinley Park, Crestwood and Oak Lawn alerted residents to stay home due to civil unrest. Many businesses boarded up. Gov. J.B. Pritzker said he activated 375 Illinois National Guard soldiers to assist local law enforcement with street closures. The downtown Chicago demonstrations that drew thousands started peacefully Saturday afternoon in a plaza, with protesters reading the names of black people who have died at the hands of police. But that gave way to violence and destruction that continued overnight Sunday in Chicago and elsewhere. Police used batons to beat back demonstrators as police cars were set ablaze and windows were smashed at businesses ranging from neighborhood convenience stores to high-end Michigan Avenue shops. Santa Monica, California: Unchecked looting as marchers confront police Looters took advantage of a large demonstration several blocks away to hit stores in the city's business district. In late afternoon, police were met with resistance when they tried to end a demonstration that had been peaceful. Demonstrators constructed a makeshift barricade in the middle of a street to protect themselves from non-lethal rounds fired by officers. The march had attracted hundreds along the city's main oceanfront boulevard. Though there were many police officers present for the march, looters were able to plunder stores with few to stop them. Cars were seen pulling up in front of stores, with looters running in to collect bundles of clothes and other merchandise, then running out. Boxes littered the sidewalk as thieves were seen transferring goods into plastic trash bags. A 5:30 p.m. PST curfew was announced due to the protests. The looting came despite the arrival of the National Guard troops in neighboring Los Angeles, which had seen extensive looting, vandalism and arson on Saturday. Murfreesboro, Tennessee: Brick thrown into business, police use tear gas A small but tense demonstration in Murfreesboro, Tennessee, appeared to have dispersed after demonstrators blocked traffic and threw a brick through the window of a local business, prompting police to respond with canisters of tear gas. About 50 protesters, many of whom appeared to be Middle Tennessee State University students, marched from Main Street toward Forrest Hall, a campus building named for Confederate general and Ku Klux Klan founder Nathan Bedford Forrest. Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee said protests in Murfreesboro are now “overt threats to public safety and property.” Police said an armored vehicle was vandalized and protesters have blocked traffic by lying in the street in an intersection. Officers responded by throwing canisters of tear gas to drive protesters out of the street. However, before the protest escalated, negotiations between police and protest leaders led to calm, then students and officers were seen walking together and posing for photos. – Nancy DeGennaro, Joseph Spears, Mealand Ragland-Hudgins and Brinley Hineman, Murfreesboro Daily News Journal Savannah, Georgia: Protesters chant 'Arrest the other three' during rally Thousands demonstrated against racism and the killings of black people at the hands of police Sunday in Savannah, Georgia. City leaders joined protesters who peacefully marched from Johnson Square to City Hall. “We need to make sure that we stop apologizing and we move from apology to action,” Savannah Police Chief Roy Minter said. At one point during Mayor Van Johnson’s speech, the crowd broke into a chant of “arrest the other three,” referring to other Minneapolis police officers who stood by while an officer knelt on Floyd’s neck. “Yeah, they should arrest the other three,” Johnson said. “We are tired of the mess and we want it to stop now. We stand here as a united community to say that we are standing with George Floyd and his family, because no man should ever have to die like that,” Johnson said. “We stand here united as a community to say that crooked police officers are called criminals. And in jail, they should be.” – Will Peebles, Dennis Knight, Mary Landers, Nathan Dominitz and Zach Dennis, Savannah Morning News San Diego: Police fire tear gas after being assaulted by rocks and bottles San Diego Police said they fired tear gas canisters Sunday after rocks and bottles were thrown at them. The department said in a series of tweets that the confrontation was taking place at Second Avenue and Broadway in the seaside city's downtown. ""Certain protestors continue to throw objects and vandalize our city,"" the department said in one post. ""The criminal behavior of these few is unacceptable. We are continuing to order the crowd to disperse."" Earlier, however, the department praised the peacefulness of most demonstrators. But it said it had to issue the order to disperse because of the dangerous actions of a few. At one point, demonstrators occupied Interstate 5, stopping traffic in both directions, the San Diego Union-Tribune reported. Philadelphia: Mayor Jim Kenney 'saddened and disappointed' beyond words Another day of street protests gave way to looting, with at least one police vehicle set on fire. Looters were running out of stores in the northeastern section of the city with armloads of merchandise. In the downtown, workers and volunteers swept up broken glass from windows shattered during riots the previous day. Graffiti was being removed. Mayor Jim Kenney said the mayhem “saddened and disappointed me beyond words, and I’m sure it saddened every Philadelphian who takes pride in their city.” He said those responsible “not only desecrated private businesses, they also desecrated the important message that was heard in the earlier peaceful protests.” Spartanburg, South Carolina: Passing motorists show support for protesters Chanting “No justice, no peace,” about 100 peaceful Spartanburg, South Carolina, protesters gathered at Barnet Park, drawing support from motorists who honked their car horns. “We want to take a peaceful stand to show support,” said organizer Kelvin Brown. “If we can all come together as a people, black and white, we can make a difference.” Many protesters said it wasn’t just Floyd’s death at the hand of a white police officer, or that it took days before the officer was arrested, that triggered anger. “We need to end the racist system,” said Curtis Pickens. “If you want all this to stop, real justice is what is needed. Stop the racial and social profiling. Stop hiring white supremacist officers.” “It’s time to stand up for what we believe in,” Isaiah Jordan said. “What happened to George Floyd terrorizes the whole nation. We’ve got to do something about it. I’m just sick and tired of young, black men dying."" --Bob Montgomery, GoUpstate.com Lafayette, Louisiana: Protesters want police to know 'we're human' Hundreds of protesters, some wearing protective face coverings, lined Lafayette streets to join a peaceful demonstration against police brutality. The protest, peaceful like others in Baton Rouge and New Orleans this weekend, began in the morning with protesters lining the streets to chant. “I am sick and tired of being sick and tired,” Lafayette NAACP President Marja Broussard said to protesters. “I have a message for law enforcement. The message is: we want you to know that we’re human just like you...We want you to know we have families. We’re human.” – William Taylor Potter, Lafayette Daily Advertiser Augusta, Georgia: Demonstrators chant 'No justice, no peace' Demonstrators chanted “no justice, no peace” as they walked along Washington Road in Augusta, Georgia. While “No justice, no peace,” was a popular chant among protesters, Sunday’s peaceful march was about showing strength through peace rather than through violence, organizers said. Latoya Lovett said she asked the Street Justice Council to help her organize the marches after hearing many Augusta residents talk about going to Atlanta to join protests there, which have turned violent after peaceful starts. “You can march in your own city, you can have a voice in your own city,” Lovett said. “You don’t have to go smash windows, you don’t have to go beat people, you don’t have to drop on the police.” Demonstrators were escorted by Richmond County Sheriff’s Office deputies who blocked off roads and intersections as needed. Sheriff Richard Roundtree was among those who helped guide the marchers and ensure safety for both them and the motorists. “We believe in free speech and protesting and voicing your opinion, as long as you do it in a safe manner,” Roundtree said. “As long as you’re doing that, we’re all for it.” – Will Cheney and Miguel Legoas, The Augusta Chronicle Jacksonville, Florida: Peaceful rally follows violent Saturday night of protests A peaceful demonstration was held Sunday outside the Duval County Courthouse. Then protesters started moving downtown and Jacksonville, Florida, police worked to keep them in certain areas. The cleanup of smashed store windows began Sunday around Florida after a night of unrest throughout the state’s cities. Jacksonville Sheriff Mike Williams said an unnamed deputy was either stabbed or slashed in the neck and was taken to a hospital for treatment Saturday night. A sheriff’s office spokeswoman would not comment on the deputy’s condition Sunday morning. A protest Saturday resulted in many arrests, “but we still don’t know how many or anything related to those arrests,” the sheriff said. – Sarasota News-Tribune Cincinnati: Police make 100 arrests after urging protesters to go home Police arrested as many as 100 people after using tear gas and imploring the crowd to go home ahead of a curfew. It ended a day that earlier featured a large crowd gathered at Inwood Park in Cincinnati to hear speakers as a rally, followed by a march. Organizers gave instructions about what to do if they are tear-gassed. The rally started with a fist-up salute and a song about the death Sam DuBose, shot by a police officer not far from the scene of this protest in 2015. Some Cincinnati City Council members tweeted from the rally. – Sarah Brookbank, Cincinnati Enquirer Contributing: The Associated Press",0.0

1622481144,2020-06-01 12:26:50,George Floyd. Ahmaud Arbery. Breonna Taylor. What do we tell our children?,https://www.devilslakejournal.com/zz/news/20200601/george-floyd-ahmaud-arbery-breonna-taylor-what-do-we-tell-our-children?rssfeed=true,en,False,,344728,devilslakejournal.com,http://devilslakejournal.com/,"Should we tell the children? How? Those are among the many questions parents are asking after the recent deaths of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor. Many white parents wonder whether to talk with their kids at all, while parents of color swallow their grief and fear to have ""the talk"" once again. These deaths are part of a more complex story, one some parents have been telling for generations, and others have long felt they've had the luxury to ignore. But experts in child psychology and race-based stress say these conversations are essential for all parents to have, and they underscore that there are developmentally appropriate ways to talk to children of all ages about racism and police brutality. ""Silence will not protect you or them,"" said Beverly Daniel Tatum, a psychologist and author of, Why Are All The Black Kids Sitting Together in the Cafeteria? And Other Conversations About Race. ""Avoiding the topic is not a solution."" Racism persists, experts say, because many parents avoid difficult conversations. ""One of the most important things to remember is that you may not have all the answers and that is OK,"" said Erlanger Turner, a clinical psychologist and assistant professor of psychology at Pepperdine University who studies mental health among racial communities. USA TODAY spoke with Tatum and Turner about how to talk with children about racial violence: Why is it important to talk with children about what happened to George Floyd and other incidents of police brutality or racism in the news? Beverly Daniel Tatum: Even young children may see or hear about highly publicized incidents like the George Floyd case – perhaps overhearing the TV or the radio – and may ask questions. Or if parents are upset by the news, the child may perceive the parent’s distress and ask why mom or dad is upset. In either case, an age-appropriate explanation is better than silence. Older children with Internet access may see online images on their own. Initiating an age-appropriate conversation can give children a helpful frame for understanding difficult realities. If parents are silent, children will draw their own often faulty conclusions about what is happening and why. Erlanger Turner: Many adults are hurt and angered by these events and their children may notice changes in their mood. It is helpful to have a healthy conversation around what happened and also talk about ways to cope when you witness social injustice. Does COVID-19 warrant avoiding these conversations, given many children are already struggling with fear, anxiety and uncertainty? BDT: No. Not talking about upsetting events only fuels fear, anxiety and uncertainty. Being able to talk about something with a supportive adult can reduce fear, anxiety and uncertainty. Parents may avoid the conversation because they don’t know what to say, but it is a mistake to think that their silence is helpful. ET: I don't think that anxiety and fear about COVID-19 should stop a parent from talking about police brutality. This issue has been increasing in concern over the last few years as the number of black and brown people killed by police continue to rise. I think if you do talk with your child don't leave them in a high state of worry. Make sure to end the conversation by engaging in a pleasant activity after the difficult discussion so they won't stay worried or afraid. How do parents start these conversations and how does that change depending on the age of their children? ET: I think the first place to start a conversation around racism and police brutality is with honesty. Take ownership of your feelings and be comfortable sharing those feelings with your child. Then you can begin to allow them to share what they may already know about racial differences. I think that it is always good to allow children to share their opinion and understanding before you offer information. For younger children conversations about racism should be limited to basic facts about how people are treated differently due to the color of their skin but also acknowledge that not everyone treats people differently based on race. For older teens, parents can consider exposure to news or social media posts as discussion points about this issue. BDT: Regardless of the age of the child, it is important to balance acknowledging the reality of racism, or unfairness, with messages about the possibility of change, and the community of allies who are working together to make things better. If a child of color asks if a police officer is going to kill them, what do you say? BDT: The answer will depend on the age of the child. If it is a young child, a parent can be reassuring. “No, honey, you don’t have to worry about that. Police officers don’t want to hurt you.” In response to an older child, it can be reassuring to say something like: ""I know that it is scary to think that something like that might happen, and I really don’t want you to worry about anything like that. I know that most police officers want to help people, and most police officers never fire their guns. But sometimes they do get nervous and make mistakes. So it is important for you to know what to do if a police officer ever stops you…” Black parents often refer to this as “the talk” they have to have with their adolescent sons to increase the odds they will survive an encounter with a police officer if and when they are stopped. ET: That is a tough question. Depending on the age of the child, they may have some awareness of youth that have been killed by police. Obviously you don't want to respond in a way that is going to make children be more fearful for their safety. In my opinion, I think that you should let children know that most police officers work to protect them and their community. If a child says they are afraid or angry, what do you say? BDT: Acknowledge the child’s feelings. The parent may have similar feelings. “I know it’s upsetting to hear about and see these things happening. It upsets me too when bad things like this happen. Racism is very unfair. But it makes me feel better to know there are lots of people who want to change things."" Being able to offer specific examples of community change agents would be useful. Being able to talk about what family members are doing to speak up against unfairness is especially useful. Actions always speak louder than words. ET: If a child tells you that they are angry, that is appropriate. Don't force them to hide their emotional expression. However, be sure to help them identify ways to express their anger in a healthy manner which may include journaling or exercising to release the energy from their body. If a child is afraid for one of their friends, what do you say? BDT: “I can see that you are worried about your friend. What do you think we could do that might help him or her?” Depending on the situation, this could be an opportunity to talk about what it means to be an ally, and how to stand in solidarity with another person. ET: If a child is afraid for one of their friends, talk with them about those emotions. Allow the child to express why they may be afraid and help them identify how they can check on their friend's safety to ease their anxiety or fear. Part of what increases anxiety is the fear of the unknown. If you have a plan of action it will reduce some of those fears. How can parents talk about law enforcement in a way that is honest but also doesn’t discourage children from seeking help from law enforcement when appropriate? BDT: Most police officers become police officers because they want to help people. And there are times when we would really want a police officer to help us – give some examples – if there’s been a car accident, or if someone took something that belonged to us, etc. But sometimes a police officer does something bad, like today. When that happens, we might start to think that all police officers are like that. But it’s important to remember that that is not true. ET: I think that it is very important to talk with the children about law enforcement. For example, you can talk with them about how they protect rules in society such as making sure that people don't drive too fast so they won't harm themselves or others. Providing clear examples about the ways that law enforcement helps society will allow the child to better understand. You can also be honest about situations such as police brutality and let children know that some police officers break laws. If you have a trusted officer in your community it may be good to also allow the child to talk with them in person to reduce their fear. Should these conversations be different depending on the race of the child? BDT: Children of color are likely to experience racist encounters as they get older. They need to be helped to understand their own worth and feel affirmed in their identity as young people of color despite the negative messages they may get from others. Parents of color want to raise self-confident and empowered children who are not demoralized by other people’s racism. This requires lots of conversation about racism and how to resist it in an ongoing way throughout their children’s lives. White children are often racially isolated as a consequence of segregated schools and neighborhoods, and consequently limited in their understanding of people different from themselves. White parents who want to interrupt the cycle of racism must learn to talk to their children about it and model their own anti-racist activity. ET: According to research, white parents often don't talk with their children about race or may emphasize ""not seeing color."" The concept of colorblindness or ""not seeing color"" is more harmful than helpful and does not honor an individual's identity. ... For white families, research suggests ... conversations should focus on raising anti-racist children and encouraging more friendships with children from others races. Many of these deaths garner attention because footage of it goes viral. What should we say if our child asks to see it? BDT: There are many adults who don’t want to see such footage. I would not show it to a child at all. Once an image is in your head, it is very difficult to get it out. That said, it is reasonable to describe what happened and talk about why it was wrong. It is also likely that children with Internet access can view the footage without an adult’s permission or assistance. Talking about it after the fact will help children process their feelings. ET: You should not show your children these videos as it may increase the likelihood of them experiencing symptoms of trauma or having nightmares. What we know from research on witnessing disasters is that individuals may be at a higher risk of developing post-traumatic stress disorder even through indirect exposure to these events. What do we say if, in the course of this conversation, a child says something racist? BDT: Inquire about it with curiosity, not judgment. ""I’m wondering why you said that…"" After hearing more about what the child is thinking, you can offer correction by providing new information. “You know, a lot of people might think that is true, but I don’t because….” ET: I think the first thing to do is to not get defensive. You want to foster open communication with your child. However, I think you should explore why they have that opinion, where did they learn it from, and tell them why what they said was wrong. It might be helpful for you as a parent to think about ways that you may have unconsciously expressed racist attitudes. How can parents explain the uprisings in a way that doesn’t condone violence but also doesn't minimize the sense of injustice fueling them? BDT: Children understand the concept of unfairness as well as the experience of frustration. Years and years of unfairness – racism – results in intense anger and frustration. The conversation can then be about what we must do to fix the continuing unfairness. ET: I think it is important for parents to be honest. Share your hurt, anger, or disappointment with your child. You should also talk about different ways to protest social injustice such as calling your local politicians office or even visit their office to talk with them about policy change to reduce injustice.

What a galling thing. I have some familiarity with the feeling. Circa 2009 I was a young blogger and participated in organizing ""tea party"" rallies around the state. When that movement started it was something very pure and beautiful. Citizens coming together to express deep-seated concerns over the way our country was being governed. But then some extreme elements turned up at our events. People holding obnoxious signs, or doing and saying obnoxious things. Eventually, our movement was co-opted by grifters and political operatives who turned it into something very cynical. Those were not people I wanted to be associated with, but how do you stop them from showing up to an open rally? How do you stop the news media -- made up of left-leaning journalists who are deeply skeptical of conservative initiatives anyway -- from lumping you in with them? It was deeply frustrating. I suspect that's how many of the Floyd protest organizers are feeling today. They wanted to express a necessary and appropriate rage over very real law enforcement abuses and it got overshadowed by idiots setting fires. Now they're stuck standing in front of news cameras apologizing for things they didn't do and didn't want to happen. Worse, there are some who believe the violence is appropriate. That somehow burning down businesses and residences owned by people who have nothing to do with police violence is just appropriate collateral damage in some new war.

It's a dangerous way of thinking. To illustrate the danger, let's talk about another activist from another era of American history who was upset about law enforcement abuse. He watched the ATF essentially murder two people during a standoff in Idaho (the federal government has never admitted to wrongdoing, but they did make a monetary settlement in a wrongful death lawsuit). He watched the ATF turn a small investigation into some minor weapons violations in Texas into a 51-day siege that resulted in the deaths of 82 U.S. citizens, including 76 who were burned alive. Timothy McVeigh took what happened in Ruby Ridge, Idaho, and Waco, Texas, and used it as justification for a fertilizer bomb detonated outside a federal building in Oklahoma City, which killed 168 people and wounded some 680 more. Like many of the folks who justify the violence of the George Floyd protests, McVeigh thought he was acting righteously, too. He wasn't. He was a monster who murdered innocents.

""People were trying their best, given the circumstances, and this is something we will just need to follow."" Health officials also addressed the effects on contact tracing of a potential post-protest wave of new cases.

The health department on Monday reported a sharp drop off in new cases of COVID-19 with just 361 cases, a welcome reduction after days of new daily case totals nearly twice that amount. But the state also reported high testing over the last three days. On Monday, the state reported that 6,073 tests were conducted Sunday, all by private labs. State offices near the Capitol building were closed over the weekend and the health department lab did not conduct testing Saturday or Sunday.

Jack Manderscheid, a University of Minnesota senior, exemplified the spirit of the day by meticulously walking through the Uptown neighborhood filling up four trash bags that he carried on his bicycle. “I’ve never really seen a community come together,” said Manderscheid, a native of suburban Edina who woke up Sunday intent on finding one gesture to help put the city. There have been five nights of anguished protests following the Monday death of George Floyd, a black man whose neck was knelt on for nearly nine minutes by Derek Chauvin, a white police officer. Manderscheid had attended a demonstration earlier in the week, but the fumes from tear gas used by police officers bothered him. So had the large crowds during a time when he is trying to keep his distance from people over fears of spreading the new coronavirus. He instead decided to clean the streets and sidewalks, only to find that hundreds of others had the same idea. “The longer this goes on, the more I realize I’m going to remember this the rest of my life,” Manderscheid said. Meanwhile, Dan Halvorsen picked up trash and swept away debris along with seven other members of his church in suburban Bloomington. “We wanted to perform a good deed. Our hearts are just breaking about this whole situation,” he said. “By the time we got here, the response has been so amazing, that there wasn’t a big need for us.” Other residents found a way to help by providing food, diapers and other essentials in a city where most stores and restaurants are closed. That’s how Tracy Gray Knutson found herself an unwitting, but perfectly willing, Santa Claus of sorts. Knutson, 40, sat down on a chair on the sidewalk outside a boarded-up Franklin Avenue café, planning to rest her sunburned feet. Above her, a large sign read: “Free Food and Stuff.” Residents of the south Minneapolis neighborhood surveyed the scene and decided that Knutson was in charge of a popup pantry. Soon, they descended on her with sacks of bread, beans and other groceries, plus diapers, bottled water and even more garbage bags ready to be filled. Knutson, who said she is recently homeless, enjoyed giving the goods away to a line of people who politely approached her, asking if it was really free. “Anything you want, brother. Take anything,” she implored one hesitant man. “I love you.” A few blocks away on Franklin Avenue, an east-west thoroughfare lined with stores that now sit empty, Alan Gross oversaw an impromptu food shelf that quickly resembled a warehouse. Gross, 52, jokingly called himself a barista/counselor/bouncer at two businesses that share a building: Powwow Grounds Coffee and All My Relations Gallery. The latter is a large space that typically displays American Indian art. It was shuttered in March after the COVID-19 threat forced the closure of museums and galleries in Minnesota. The art has been relocated, although Gross hopes to reopen soon. On Sunday, the floor was rapidly filling with food brought in by the carload from people eager to help. It all happened over the course of 72 hours, after word went out on Facebook that the gallery would serve as a distribution point for groceries in the neighborhood. Gross was surprised by the amount of donated food but philosophical about the motivation of his fellow Minnesotans. “Pitching in, believing that there’s a better way to do things, I think that’s the draw,” he said. “Everyone’s got to have a cause.”",0.0

Protestors line the intersection of 72nd and Dodge on Friday, May 29, 2020, in Omaha to protest the death of George Floyd on Monday night after a Minneapolis Police officer knelt on his neck. (Emily Dwire / WOWT) “Decedent experienced a cardiopulmonary arrest while being restrained by law enforcement officer(s),” the Hennepin County Medical Examiner's Office said in a news release. Cause of death was listed as “cardiopulmonary arrest complicating law enforcement subdual, restraint and neck compression.” Under ""other significant conditions” it said Floyd suffered from heart disease and hypertension, and listed fentanyl intoxication and recent methamphetamine use. Those factors were not listed under cause of death. A Minneapolis police officer was charged last week with third-degree murder in Floyd’s death, and three other officers were fired. Bystander video showed the officer, Derek Chauvin, holding his knee on Floyd’s neck despite the man's cries that he can't breathe until he eventually stopped moving. A separate autopsy commissioned for Floyd’s family also called his death a homicide. It concluded that that he died of asphyxiation due to neck and back compression, said the family’s attorney, Ben Crump, who called for the charge against Chauvin to be upgraded to first-degree murder and for three other officers to be charged. He didn't say what the charges against the other officers should be. That autopsy, by a forensic pathologist who also examined Eric Garner’s body, found the compression cut off blood to Floyd’s brain, and that the pressure of other officers' knees on his back made it impossible for him to breathe, Crump said. Both the medical examiner and the family’s experts differed from the description in last week’s criminal complaint against the officer of how Floyd died. The complaint, citing preliminary findings from the medical examiner, listed the effects of being restrained, along with underlying health issues and potential intoxicants in Floyd’s system. But it also said nothing was found “to support a diagnosis of traumatic asphyxia or strangulation.” Neither side has released its full autopsy report so far. The family's autopsy found no evidence of heart disease and concluded he had been healthy. Floyd, a black man who was in handcuffs at the time, died after Chauvin, who is white, ignored bystander shouts to get off Floyd and Floyd's cries that he couldn't breathe. His death sparked days of protests in Minneapolis and around America. The complaint provided no details about intoxicants. In the 911 call that drew police, the caller described the man suspected of paying with counterfeit money as “awfully drunk and he’s not in control of himself.” Floyd’s family and attorneys, like the families of other black men killed by police, commissioned their own autopsy because they didn’t trust local authorities to produce an unbiased report. The family's autopsy was done by Michael Baden and Allecia Wilson. Baden is the former chief medical examiner of New York City, and was hired to do an autopsy of Garner, a black man who died in 2014 after New York police placed him in a chokehold and he pleaded that he could not breathe. Baden also did an autopsy at the family's request for Michael Brown, an 18-year-old shot by police in Ferguson, Missouri. He said Brown didn’t reveal signs of a struggle, casting doubt on a claim by police that a struggle between Brown and the officer led to the shooting. Dr. Judy Melinek, a forensic pathologist from the San Francisco Bay area who blogs about the subject and is not connected with the case, said the key difference between the medical examiner's conclusions and those of Baden and Walker are the official finding of “significant” conditions for Floyd, including heart disease and drugs in his system. Baden and Wilson acknowledged on a conference call with reporters that they didn't have access to the tissue samples that the medical examiner kept that might have given more information on his health. Nor did they have their own toxicology results yet. Melinek said it's not unusual for different pathologists to reach different determinations, given that they may be looking at different information and that they've had different experiences and training. Under the law, a medical examiner determines the cause and manner of death, but it's up to prosecutors to decide whether criminal charges are warranted. The term homicide means only that a person's death was caused by another person. Chauvin, who was also charged with manslaughter, is being held in a state prison. The other three officers on scene, like Chauvin, were fired the day after the incident but have not been charged. The head of the Minneapolis police union said in a letter to members that the officers were fired without due process and labor attorneys are fighting for their jobs. Lt. Bob Kroll, the union president, also criticized city leadership, saying a lack of support is to blame for the days of sometimes violent protests. When asked to respond, Mayor Jacob Frey said Kroll's opposition to reform and lack of empathy for the community has undermined trust in the police. Gov. Tim Walz announced Sunday that Attorney General Keith Ellison would take the lead in any prosecutions in Floyd's death. Local civil rights activists have said Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman doesn't have the trust of the black community. They have protested outside his house, and pressed him to charge the other three officers. Freeman remains on the case. ___ Associated Press writer Doug Glass contributed.

But a few turned out to be rioters. People gathered early on Sunday, May 31, to sweep away the destruction from a protest the night before that turned violent in the heart of a downtown littered in the aftermath with broken glass and debris. The more difficult job, leaders acknowledged in a somber press conference, will be to address the simmering distrust and alienation that boiled over into violence as remnants of a peaceful throng turned into an angry mob. The first signs of unrest became evident the afternoon of Saturday, May 30. Demonstrators marched from Island Park near downtown to demand justice in the case of George Floyd, a Minneapolis man who died after an arresting police officer knelt on his neck for eight minutes as he pleaded for mercy. Most of the demonstrators carried signs. A few hurled rocks and water bottles at the police who lined the streets along the route, which took marchers to police headquarters in Fargo and West Fargo. listen live watch live It was an early sign of what was to come. A crowd gathered outside Fargo police headquarters and, when it became clear that unrest was possible, Moorhead (Minn.) Mayor Johnathan Judd turned to Fargo Mayor Tim Mahoney and said they had to intervene. A peaceful dialogue, joined by Fargo Police Chief David Todd and some of his officers, some holding signs in solidarity with the protesters, seemed to defuse the tension. Todd even posed for photographs. The trouble came Saturday evening, when demonstrators gathered downtown. A turning point came at 5:53 p.m., when a mob surrounded two Fargo police officers in a squad car at First Avenue North and Broadway, throwing rocks and bottles, badly damaging the cruiser and menacing the officers, who were rescued by fellow officers. Todd decided that there was a limit to patience, that police should try to clear lingering protesters out of downtown before darkness fell and the situation could spiral out of control. The police had stood by with restraint “for as long as we thought we could,” Todd said Sunday. But given the reports that elements within the protesters planned to “loot and burn,” the chief decided the time had come to act. “So we thought, while we’ve got daylight and we can see everybody, let’s try and start pushing everybody out of the downtown area.” Similarly, the mayors who had acted as peacemakers earlier in the day concluded that the situation was too combustible to try another round of dialogue with the now-angry crowd. “I have to be safe,” Judd said. “So my compromise was to stand on the bridge with the law enforcement officers from the state of Minnesota and their jurisdictions should anything come into Moorhead.” Around 8 p.m., police fired the first tear gas canisters to scatter the crowd, numbering perhaps 400 or 500, which Todd said was seeded with “instigators” whose mission was to egg on others to become violent — intelligence gleaned from plainclothes officers who mingled undercover with the demonstrators. “They were traveling from city to city to do specifically this, to cause mayhem and confusion,” he said, adding that some other protesters might have been drawn into joining the violence. A line of police officers formed on First Avenue North, slowly edging east toward Fifth Street, in a prolonged standoff with demonstrators that was punctuated by looting of several businesses, escalating into a riot. “That was heartbreaking last night,” Todd said at the press conference Sunday. “It was hard to watch that happen.” He added: “You could see some hostility in that march, but you could see good people, too. There were a lot of good people.” Looters stole furniture and other items from JL Beers and broke into Gate City Bank, but did not succeed in stealing any money, Todd said. Gov. Doug Burgum activated the North Dakota National Guard, many of whom were training over the weekend to assist law enforcement. The Guard was deployed at 9 p.m., Burgum said, and stood ready to protect firefighters if any fires were started. “We came through it without a fire; we came through it without any serious injuries,” the governor said. “That’s something to be said.” Police arrested 10 demonstrators accusing them of inciting a riot and preventing arrest. Four officers needed medical attention, including two for concussions from objects thrown and two for heat exhaustion and dehydration, Todd said. Two demonstrators received medical attention, including one for a gash on an arm, he said. There was no severe property damage, officials said, although eight police cars were damaged. Police will be reviewing video of the march and downtown confrontation and more arrests are possible, Todd said. Mahoney and Judd said the protesters’ voices were heard. They promised to work to address their concerns, but pleaded for a peaceful dialogue to address what Judd called “institutional racism” that lies at the heart of the grievances that transformed downtown Fargo into a riot scene. On Sunday morning, Mahoney lifted a curfew he had imposed Saturday night and said he hopes there will be no further demonstrations as the city works to rebuild and heal. “The heart and soul of our community … that’s our focus now,” he said. “Last night’s actions do not define this community and its people,” he said, pointing to the swift way people came together to clean up. The mayor urged people to come together to peacefully resolve grievances. “We need to hear each other, we need to be tolerant, we need to care about each other,” Mahoney said. Cass County Sheriff Jesse Jahner said that while the majority of the protesters were peaceful, many wanted confrontation, and struck a firmer note when he vowed: “Law enforcement will succeed in regaining control.” North Dakota respects and honors people's right to free speech and assembly, Burgum said. He said officials want to send a message valuing “justice and humanity” and pledged to join together to resolve issues. “It’s lost when it moves from a peaceful protest to what I think can only be described as an organized riot,” Burgum said. “If you want to have a dialogue in North Dakota, all you have to do is ask.” Local members of Black Lives Matter, which organized the march, were on hand Sunday as workers continued to clean up downtown. “The crowds down here last night does not represent us,” John Lewis said. “It was not us,” fellow organizer Ritchell Eve Aboah said. A few troublemakers turned a peaceful protest into a riot, Lewis said. “But we can’t claim responsibility for that. I’m a student. I want to make the world a better place. We are very sad that this went down yesterday. This is our home. We’re going to clean this place up, but this is not Black Lives Matter.” Judd, who said he had little sleep over the past four days, delivered an eloquent appeal to deal with the root causes underlying the frustrations that reached a flashpoint Saturday. “We honestly need to have a very serious conversation about race in this country,” he said, including a “candid conversation about institutional racism.” He added, for emphasis, “It’s true, folks.” Judd praised the Fargo Police Department, which he said acted in an “extremely professional capacity,” for displaying patience before they took firm action. “They acted with integrity,” he said. For those who turned out to protest, Judd added: “We heard you. We need in this community to listen with humility. We don’t have all the answers individually, but collectively we can make a difference in this community, and we will.” Archie Ingersoll and Chris Flynn contributed to this report.",0.0

Health experts fear carriers of coronavirus, which causes the disease, with no symptoms could unwittingly infect others at protests where social distancing is simply not taking place. The merits of the protesters' cause ""doesn’t prevent them from getting the virus,” said Bradley Pollock, chairman of the Department of Public Health Sciences at the University of California, Davis. At least one protester in Tampa, Florida, is known to have COVID-19. Tampa Police Chief Brian Dugan, who expressed dismay last week about Floyd's death, tweeted Monday that five of his officers were exposed to the protester, whom he did not identify. Protesting – especially without a mask – can put people at higher risk for infection, said Dr. Michael Mina, an assistant professor of epidemiology at Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health. ""There's no doubt in my mind that these can become breeding grounds for this virus,"" he said during a Monday media availability. ""I would not be surprised to see in the next couple of weeks that we see increases that may be linked to protests."" Viral photos: A photo page of striking moments from the week’s protests. As businesses re-open, it will be difficult to figure out whether someone caught the virus at a protest or in some other encounter, Mina said. Hopefully, the fact that protests are taking place out of doors, will dilute the virus and reduce disease transmission, he said. Wearing a mask will help reduce infections, though it won't completely eliminate risk. ""If there's a floridly positive person who is coughing and spending a whole day around a lot of other people, that person might very well get other people sick despite having a mask on,"" Mina added, but ""there's a good chance that even homemade masks will actually do quite a bit to help people not get infected and not transmit."" There is historical precedent to suggest that viruses can be spread by large public gatherings. In September 1918, people in Philadelphia held a parade to celebrate the return of soldiers from World War I. The gathering of 200,000 people, crammed shoulder to shoulder, reignited a deadly flu epidemic, leading to massive closures and thousands of deaths, records show. Yet, there's a public health cost to not protesting the status quo, said Dr. Hillary Babcock, an infectious disease specialist at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, and immediate past president of the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America. ""Systemic racism also causes large public health impacts and public health risks for large portions of our population,"" Babcock said. She disagreed with calls for protesters to stay home to avoid fueling the outbreak. ""I don't think using public health as a reason to discourage protests after these events is really appropriate,"" Babcock said. ""It's a little disingenuous to say that the health risk from protesting is somehow bigger than the health risk at Lake of Ozarks (where people gathered for fun over Memorial Day weekend) or the practices that brought us to this point in the first place."" At least one reveler at the lake party tested positive for COVID-19, according to the Camden County Health Department. Others were advised to monitor for symptoms. Babcock said it is possible to minimize the risks of protesting, with masks, social distancing and asking sick people to stay home. Arresting people and putting them into close contact with others increases risk, Babcock said, as does spraying protesters with pepper spray, which causes violent coughing and can potentially spread the virus. Timeline: George Floyd protests: How did we get here? Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency room physician and former Baltimore health commissioner, said there is risk of longer-term effects in communities disproportionately affected by COVID-19. Wen was Baltimore's health commissioner when protests erupted following the 2015 death of Freddie Gray. The death triggered civil unrest in communities already burdened with deep-seated inequities, she said. ""When over a dozen pharmacies burned down and closed and stores were looted, it was community members themselves who were affected the most,"" Wen said. While protests over the past week following Floyd's death have highlighted police-community relations, demonstrators are also calling attention to social justice issues, including health disparities. ""The same communities that are already the most affected are potentially going to have an increase in the number of cases as a result of people gathering,"" Wen said. Melanie Campbell, president of the National Coalition on Black Civic Participation, said anger in the black community has been building for years. Floyd's death spurred them to take to the streets, even as the coronavirus has taken a disproportionate toll on African Americans. ""Black people are risking their lives protesting in the middle of a pandemic that’s killing black folks. That’s real,"" she said. ""There is no convenient time to fight back."" Meanwhile, state and local public health agencies plan to monitor for new COVID-19 cases. Any large gathering during a pandemic is a concern, said John C. Welch, director of partnerships and operations for the Massachusetts Covid Response project. Partners in Health, a Boston-based nonprofit, handles Massachusetts’ contact tracing of individuals infected with or exposed to the virus. Following such a large gathering, potential cases need to be monitored over two weeks, the virus’s incubation period. “The epidemic curve should guide the response and the phased reopening of society,"" Welch said. ""Until the epidemic is declared over, social distancing and wearing masks should remain the new normal."" Peter Pitts, president and co-founder of the Center for Medicine in the Public Interest, a nonpartisan research and educational organization, said he worries COVID-19 will take advantage of people gathering to protest police violence. ""Social distancing and social conflict are a very potent negative combination when it comes to spreading a virus,"" he said. ""The timing is highly unfortunate."" Public health concerns, which are usually complicated, can easily be drowned out by other ""sexier"" stories, he said, citing the recent SpaceX launch. But the virus ""doesn't cease to be a real threat because of other threats happening simultaneously,"" he said. ""That means we have to twice as smart and twice as dedicated and twice as focused.""

But the emotions might have been even more heightened for Hanson, who is the president and CEO of Gate City Bank — a bank with a downtown branch, at 500 2nd Ave. N. — right in the heart of the riot. “I kept seeing our sign on the news,” he said. “It was pretty nerve-wracking.” Sunday morning he got up bright and early to see what kind of damage the bank had suffered. Hanson says the most important thing was that everyone was safe and nobody got hurt, but he was curious to see how the bank fared after the night of violence. “It was about 7:20, and there were already people all over the place cleaning and sweeping. It was very heartwarming,” Hanson said. When he arrived, he found glass doors on the east side of the building shattered and a sign and a parking structure full of graffiti. listen live watch live About a dozen volunteers scrubbed the Gate City sign and the concrete structure Sunday morning. “We’re appreciative to everyone who came out to help,” Hanson said. “We have such a feeling of gratitude for our community coming together.” But volunteers were unable to get the job completed Sunday because Fargo police suggested too many people were starting to gather downtown. For safety reasons, both for concerns over the spread of COVID-19 and a fear of accidents, police suggested volunteers do what they could but then head home. That left the sign and the parking structure not quite clean, but Hanson says they immediately hired a painter to come out Monday morning and finish what the volunteers started. “If you were to walk past the building now, you can’t even tell,” he said. “We opened for business as usual.” Hanson says they’ve ordered new glass for the doors and placed plywood there in the meantime. Right across the street from Gate City, the Exchange Building was among the hardest hit by graffiti. On Monday, a professional cleaner was spray blasting off the remainder of the paint. The Red River Women’s Clinic is mostly clean, as is the Hotel Donaldson. Graffiti at Royal Jewelers is still slightly visible. Chris Schlepp of Fargo’s Business Improvement District, an organization whose goal it is to improve and enhance the overall attractiveness and appeal of downtown Fargo, says he’s putting together a “best practices document” to assist businesses with cleanup. He’s speaking to colleagues in other cities who might have recommendations for cleaning supplies or equipment to tackle the worst of the graffiti. And, he says, the phone has been ringing all morning from those wanting to help. “We’ve been hearing from a lot from people, businesses and organizations wanting to donate supplies or even money to buy supplies,” he said. Schlepp says once they get the supplies, they’ll donate them to the businesses. It’s unclear how long it will be before downtown no longer has visible scars from Saturday’s riot, but it won’t be for lack of effort from citizens. “The amount of community support we’ve seen is humbling,” says Schlepp. “It shows what a great community Fargo is.”  ",0.0

Over 300 people showed up to Minot’s Oak Park Sunday afternoon to reflect and mourn over the life of George Floyd. “I was complaining about how I wanted to go to the cities and wasn’t able to make it. So my friend was like why don’t you do one here,” said Bre Nickelson. Bre Nickelson, who organized the Black Lives Matter protest, says the turnout for the event was far more than she expected. She says it shows that the people in the Minot community are able to come together as one. “As I’ve been saying today, we live in this very secluded community where we don’t have the experience to the rest of the country. And if people don’t pay attention they aren’t going to see what’s happening going on everywhere else,” added Nickelson. Many people at the protest had signs, displaying their thoughts, about the current issues in the world. Along with parents and their children at the event, there were also local organizations, showing that they stand behind each other and the community, in such dark times. “Being bikers, we are diverse all across the world. We come from all different areas and we come from different beliefs and different views. But what we can do is care about one another,” said Evan Hunt. The vice president of the Ice Cold Ryders Motorcycle Club says it is important for him to use his voice in the community to help encourage others as well as inform them about issues such as race. Hunt added, “Being silently complicit on things like this isn’t going to work for us. So when people speak out for people who can’t speak it gives people the strength to stand back up.” Other speakers at the event shared the same ideas. Being the voice for the voiceless, and encouraging others to take a stand for such an import issue. I believe in preventing something before it happens. I don’t like to react to situations, I like to already prevent them from happening. So it’s important that we need to stand together now if we have not. Because if we stand together now because when those outside influences try to come in and divide us, they can’t,” said one speaker, Ernest Usher. Nickelson says the knows it will take more than one protest to change things in America, but Sunday’s event was a start. A start to what she hopes is a shift in the way we love and care for one another.",0.0

There were also rumors of similar buses, these carrying paid protesters, rolling toward Minot, N.D. There were later rumors that these buses were headed down I-29 from Fargo to Sioux Falls, S.D., to start trouble down there. Who knows where the buses are now. Ottumwa, Iowa? Kearney, Neb.? Gillette, Wyo.? listen live watch live Certainly they are somewhere. Certainly they aren't a figment of the imagination. Hope not. If so, there are going to be a lot of conservatives miffed the mysterious buses that always show up at protests, always filled with paid out-of-state protesters, always looking for trouble, don't actually exist. They're like Bigfoot. A segment of the populace talks about them as if they're real, they have their true believers, but nobody ever provides substantive proof they exist. Maybe a grainy, out-of-focus photo of one of these buses would help. I asked a Fargo Police Department spokeswoman if there is any evidence the mystery buses were in Fargo on Saturday. They were supposedly in a Kmart parking lot, where members of the local media searched to no avail. ""We’re still looking into all that information. We know there were several vehicles downtown without plates during the riot and march,"" she replied in an email. Police chief Dave Todd said in his Sunday morning remarks assessing his department's response to the downtown looting that he believed 40-50 people came from out of town ""not to participate in the event, but to hijack it and turn it into something else."" He didn't provide further details, nor did the department spokeswoman when asked where these out-of-towners came from. Todd did say the department got its information from intelligence provided by undercover officers embedded in the peaceful march and by monitoring social media. We do know that eight of the 10 people being held in the Cass County jail on riot-related charges were locals. Seven from Fargo, one from West Fargo. One person didn't have a permanent address and the other was from California. So at least 80% of those arrested didn't ride a bus to the protest. Unless it was a MAT bus. Baffling, is what it is. I'm not doubting Todd's information. If he says 40-50 people came from out of town to stir up trouble amongst the thousands of peaceful protesters, I'll take him at his word and keep asking if the department can provide more information. Maybe the department will make more arrests based on video that captured the rioters' faces. I don't doubt that people drove from elsewhere looking to agitate. But the buses? I want to know more about the buses I keep hearing about on Facebook and Twitter. Are they comfortable coach buses with air conditioning and TVs? Or are they old rattletrap school buses from 30 years ago? Maybe they're super-fancy like the tour buses second-level country music stars roll around in. I don't know how much a professional protester makes, so I don't know what they can afford. Nobody wants to believe locals are ever the bad guys in these cases. It's always paid protesters being bused in to wreak havoc. Even if the locals are the ones being arrested. Doesn't really seem fair. You'd think law enforcement would be able to spot the buses, if they exist, and turn them around at the city limits like a sheriff in an old western movie. I know this: Starting rumors about bused-in protesters allows conservatives to miss the point of the marches and protests completely, which is convenient. Instead of focusing on the substance behind the protest, in this case police brutality and people of color feeling like their concerns are continually brushed aside by the white establishment, carping about paid protesters coming in by the busload gives aggrieved conservatives more about which to be aggrieved. They imagine a roving band of protesters cruising from city to city, town to town to cause trouble. Like a carnival of chaos. Organized lefty groups riding around in buses, probably smoking weed and listening to rap, going from virginal burg to virginal burg causing trouble is the right's nightmare. It's an amazing, mysterious story. Like Bigfoot. And a helluva lot easier to get worked up about than, you know, actually addressing the problems that led to the peaceful protests in the first place.",0.0

Twitter flagged and demoted Trump's tweet about the protests when he used the phrase “when the looting starts the shooting starts.” Facebook has let it stand, and Zuckerberg explained his reasoning in a Facebook post Friday. “I know many people are upset that we’ve left the President’s posts up, but our position is that we should enable as much expression as possible unless it will cause imminent risk of specific harms or dangers spelled out in clear policies,” Zuckerberg wrote. Angry demonstrations have spread across the U.S. over the past week, creating some of the most widespread racial unrest since the 1960s. The protests, which have been met by violent police action in many cities, were spurred by the death of George Floyd, a black man who died after he was pinned to the pavement by an officer who put his knee on the handcuffed man's neck until he stopped breathing. Trump's comment evoked the civil-rights era by borrowing a phrase used in 1967 by Miami’s police chief to warn of an aggressive police response to unrest in black neighborhoods. On Monday, dozens of Facebook employees staged a virtual “walkout” to protest the company's decision not to touch the Trump posts according to a report in the New York Times, which cited anonymous senior employees at Facebook. The Times report says dozens of Facebook workers “took the day off by logging into Facebook’s systems and requesting time off to support protesters across the country."" Workers also expressed frustration in other ways, including posting on Twitter, speaking to managers and writing on Facebook's internal communication network. Though virtual, this was the first time that Facebook workers have staged a walkout in the company's history. Employees at the social media giant have been less outspoken than their counterparts at other tech companies such as Google and Twitter. “I work at Facebook and I am not proud of how we’re showing up. The majority of coworkers I’ve spoken to feel the same way. We are making our voice heard,” tweeted Jason Toff, a director of product management at Facebook who's been at the company for a year. Toff, who has a verified Twitter account, had 131,400 “likes” and thousands of retweets of his comment. He did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment on Monday. “I don’t know what to do, but I know doing nothing is not acceptable. I’m a FB employee that completely disagrees with Mark’s decision to do nothing about Trump’s recent posts, which clearly incite violence. I’m not alone inside of FB. There isn’t a neutral position on racism,” Facebook design manager Jason Stirman tweeted. Stirman did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Monday. Sara Zhang, a product designer at the company, tweeted that Facebook's “decision to not act on posts that incite violence ignores other options to keep our community safe. The policy pigeon holes us into addressing harmful user-facing content in two ways: keep content up or take it down.” “I believe that this is a self-imposed constraint and implore leadership to revisit the solution,” she continued. Zhang declined to comment to The Associated Press. “We recognize the pain many of our people are feeling right now, especially our Black community. We encourage employees to speak openly when they disagree with leadership. As we face additional difficult decisions around content ahead, we’ll continue seeking their honest feedback,” Facebook spokeswoman Liz Bourgeois said in a statement Monday. Facebook moved a weekly employee question and answer session with executives to Tuesday from this coming Thursday to respond to workers' concerns. Late Sunday, Zuckerberg again posted on Facebook, pledging a $10 million donation to racial justice groups. But he made no mention of Trump's posts. Instead, he highlighted Facebook's role in the spreading of the video of Floyd's death. “We need to know George Floyd’s name. But it’s clear Facebook also has more work to do to keep people safe and ensure our systems don’t amplify bias,” Zuckerberg wrote. Twitter has historically taken stronger stances than its larger rival, including a complete ban on political advertisements that Twitter announced last November. That’s partly because Facebook, a much larger company with a broader audience,targeted by regulators over its size and power, has more to lose. And partly because the companies’ CEOs don’t always see eye to eye on their role in society. Over the weekend, Twitter changed the background and logo of its main Twitter account to black from its usual blue in support of the Black Lives Matter protesters and added a #blacklivesmatter hashtag. Facebook did the same with its own logo on its site, though without the hashtag. Copyright 2020 Associated Press. All rights reserved.",0.0
1622689462,2020-06-01 17:54:58,Barr: Law enforcement must ‘dominate’ streets amid protests,https://www.valleynewslive.com/content/news/Barr-Law-enforcement-must-dominate-streets-amid-protests-570932831.html,en,True,,86247,valleynewslive.com,http://www.valleynewslive.com/#spider,"U.S. officials vowed to “maximize federal law enforcement presence” in the nation’s capital Monday night after days of violent demonstrations led to fires across Washington and left scores of businesses with broken windows and dozens of police officers injured. Vehicles for the District of Columbia National Guard are seen outside the D.C. Armory, Monday, June 1, 2020, in Washington. Protests have erupted across the United States to protest the death of Floyd, a black man who was killed in police custody in Minneapolis on May 25. (Source: AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin) In a call with governors, President Donald Trump and Attorney General William Barr also encouraged more aggressive action against those who cause violence during protests across the country following the killing of George Floyd, a black man who died after a white Minneapolis policeman pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes even after Floyd stopped moving and pleading for air. The demonstrations have turned violent in several cities, with fires ignited in Lafayette Park across from the White House. The comments from Trump, Barr and other federal officials appeared aimed at avoiding similar scenes Monday night, when protesters were expected to gather again. But there were also questions about whether using more aggressive law enforcement measures against demonstrators protesting police brutality would only increase tensions. Barr told the state leaders that law enforcement officials must ""have adequate force"" and ""go after troublemakers."" ""Law enforcement response is not going to work unless we dominate the streets,"" Barr said. Trump said he was ""taking immediate presidential action to stop the violence and restore security and safety in America."" The president urged governors to deploy the National Guard, which he credited with helping calm the situation Sunday night in Minneapolis, and demanded that similarly tough measures be taken in cities that also experienced spasms of violence, including New York, Philadelphia and Los Angeles. ""Mayors and governors must establish an overwhelming law enforcement presence until the violence has been quelled,"" Trump said. ""If a city or state refuses to take the actions that are necessary to defend the life and property of their residents, then I will deploy the United States military and quickly solve the problem for them."" Trump directed Barr to ""lead federal law enforcement efforts to assist in the restoration of order to the District of Columbia,"" Justice Department spokesperson Kerri Kupec said. Minutes before Trump spoke Monday evening in the Rose Garden of the White House, police and members of the National Guard took aggressive action, using tear gas and flash bangs, to move back peaceful protesters who were outside Lafayette Park, across from the White House. Law enforcement officials had made a decision earlier Monday that they needed to extend the security perimeter around the White House after multiple fires broke out in Lafayette Park the night before, according to a law enforcement official who would not publicly discuss the security protocols and spoke on condition of anonymity. A Justice Department spokesperson declined to comment when asked whether Barr was involved in the decision to use tear gas on protesters outside the White House. A U.S. Park Police spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Between the protests and the response to the coronavirus pandemic, the National Guard has been deployed at its highest level in recent history, surpassing the number of troops sent to the Gulf Coast during Hurricane Katrina in 2005. More than 66,700 soldiers and airman have been activated — 45,000 to assist with the pandemic and more than 17,000 to help with the protests. Other law enforcement resources are also being mobilized. The Justice Department deployed the U.S. Marshals Service and agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration to supplement National Guard troops in Washington on Sunday. By midnight, Barr had ordered the FBI to deploy its Hostage Rescue Team, an elite tactical unit, to the streets of the nation's capital, a senior Justice Department official said. Barr has also directed the federal Bureau of Prisons to send teams of prison riot officers to patrol the streets in Miami and Washington, the official added. The federal prison system had also implemented a temporary measure to further curtail inmate movement at prisons across the U.S. ""to ensure the good order and security of our institutions, as well as ensure the safety of staff and inmates,"" the Bureau of Prisons said. Barr was traveling around Washington on Monday night to observe the protests, according to the senior Justice Department official, who would not discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. The U.S. Park Police and Secret Service have had dozens of officers out in riot gear in Washington for the last few nights, in addition to the Metropolitan Police Department. U.S. Customs and Border Protection was also sending officers, agents and aircraft around the country to assist other law enforcement agencies ""confronting the lawless actions of rioters,"" the agency said. The officers were being deployed in several states, though the official declined to provide specific details, citing security concerns. Several major cities have enacted curfews, and District of Columbia Mayor Muriel Bowser set a 7 p.m. curfew for Monday and Tuesday. Violent demonstrators ignored the 11 p.m. curfew the night before as they set buildings and trash cans on fire and broke into stores to steal items from the shelves. Most of the protesters have been peaceful and tried to discourage violence. Trump, Barr and others have tried to blame some of the civil unrest on left-wing extremist groups, including antifa, and other ""anarchists."" Short for anti-fascists, antifa is an umbrella term for far-left-leaning militant groups that resist neo-Nazis and white supremacists at demonstrations. The FBI is using its network of regional joint terrorism task forces to ""identify criminal organizers,"" and federal prosecutors across the country have been instructed to share information and utilize federal riot, arson or terror statutes against any ""violent radical agitators"" who attempt to hijack protests to cause destruction. The Justice Department has vowed to treat the ""violence instigated and carried out by antifa & other similar groups"" as domestic terrorism. Although there isn't a specific federal domestic terrorism statute, prosecutors could charge other offenses and seek enhanced sentencing. The FBI has already started questioning rioters who were arrested in several cities to determine whether they committed any federal crimes, the senior Justice Department official said. It is a federal crime to cross state lines to participate in violent riots. Between 600 and 800 National Guard members from five states — Delaware, New Jersey, New York, Ohio and Utah — are being sent to D.C. to provide assistance, senior Defense Department officials said. Those troops are either already on the ground or will arrive by midnight. In addition, officials said that soldiers from Fort Bragg, North Carolina, and Fort Drum, New York, were heading to D.C. and would be based outside the city in case they are needed. They would be prepared to respond, but the officials said they are hopeful those troops will not be needed. If they are sent in, they are not expected to be conducting any law enforcement. The officials declined to say how many active-duty troops were en route. In addition, members of the Army's 3rd Infantry Regiment, an active-duty unit known as the Old Guard and most visible as the unit that stands at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, have been called up to protect Fort Myer, Virginia, the U.S. Army post adjacent to Arlington National Cemetery. The officials said some of the National Guard in D.C. will be armed and others will not. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss ongoing military deployments. ___ Associated Press writers Lolita C.

The East Grand Forks Police Department had extra officers on the clock that evening as demonstrators staged a peaceful candlelight vigil to commemorate George Floyd, the black man who died a week ago at the hands of a white Minneapolis police officer, and Cody Holte, a Grand Forks Police Department officer who was killed assisting Grand Forks County sheriff’s deputies who came under fire as they tried to evict a man from a Grand Forks apartment. The department typically has five officers on duty on a Saturday night, according to Chief Mike Hedlund, who declined to say how many additional officers were at the ready on Saturday, May 30. “We observed from a distance. We let them have their event, and they were awesome,” Hedlund told the Herald on Monday. “I wish every protest, vigil, whatever -- I wish every one like that across the country would be this way.” It’s unclear if the same was true in Grand Forks, where a police department spokesperson said staff there were too busy planning Holte’s funeral to say how many officers were on duty on Saturday. Some of the department’s officers also headed to Fargo to help police there subdue demonstrators, but Lt. Derik Zimmel said he didn’t know how many officers did so, when they left or when they got back. listen live watch live Back across the Red River, Hedlund said a pair of East Grand Forks police officers volunteered to head to Bemidji, Minn., where city leaders had requested immediate assistance from nearby police outfits. A daytime demonstration there was peaceful, save for a brief scuffle over a police truck -- and groups of white vigilantes patrolled the area after dark. Mayor Rita Albrecht insisted that the city did not request or condone vigilantes. Hedlund said he was worried the officers heading to Bemidji might have left East Grand Forks short-handed over the weekend, if trouble did arise. “But Bemidji, at the time, was requesting emergency assistance,” he said. “And we felt it was appropriate that we respond to that.” Two other Eastside police are also members of the state’s National Guard, which was deployed en masse to the Twin Cities as sometimes-violent demonstrations there endured. Hedlund said one is heading back home and the other is still there. The vigil on Saturday, which was held outside East Grand Forks City Hall, was the only demonstration in the Grand Cities, and it was marked by emotionally raw and occasionally loud speeches about racial tension here and throughout the United States, but, aside from the occasional heckle from passersby, it was peaceful. Rumors occasionally spread through Grand Forks-area Facebook pages that additional and, perhaps, more violent demonstrations were forming or about to form after the peaceful one on Saturday. One poster on Sunday said protesters were beginning to assemble on the downtown end of University Avenue, for instance, but the only noticeable assembly there was Central High School’s graduation ceremony.

PAUL — An overwhelmed Terrence Floyd fell to his knees and cried out in anguish on the street in front of Cup Foods in southeast Minneapolis on Monday, June 1, the spot where his brother George Floyd spent his final moments a week ago before dying in police custody. In the week since, untold scores of viewers have seen the footage of George Floyd's last breaths online and on the airwaves. That video, captured by a bystander to Floyd's arrest, would burn the image of a white police officer kneeling on his neck into the public consciousness and spark a wave of protests and civil unrest that have rocked the Twin Cities area and small and large communities beyond. Outrage over George Floyd's death has renewed calls for wider policing reforms. Amid sometimes violent riots that followed his death, calls for peace and justice have also been heard. But as Brooklyn, N.Y. civil rights leader, the Rev. Kevin McCall, who appeared alongside Terrence Floyd on Monday, pointed out to onlookers, ""you'll give us peace when you give us justice."" His words came a day after major developments in the case against former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, 44, who was filmed kneeling on Floyd's neck and fired in the aftermath, were announced. Officials on Sunday, May 31, announced that Chauvin, who has been charged with murder and manslaughter, will be prosecuted by a team led by Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison. listen live watch live And Monday, attorneys for Floyd's family released the results of an independent autopsy that listed his cause of death as asphyxiation. Also on Monday, the Hennepin County Medical Examiner's office declared Floyd's manner of death as homicide. Police initially said Floyd was sent to the hospital when he experienced medical distress during his arrest, which was made in the course of their response to a counterfeiting incident called in by Cup Foods on Monday. Prior to his arrest, Floyd was found in a car matching the description of one reported in the call to police. Whether Ellison's appointment to the case, something lawmakers and members of Floyd's family had called for, will quell further unrest in Minneapolis and St. Paul remains to be seen. But an ongoing curfew order appears to have been more widely adhered to on Sunday evening, when local authorities responded to fewer fires and incidents of property damage. What was clear from a visit to Cup Foods on Monday, however, was that a community is still mourning for George Floyd, 46, and the many other black Americans who have died in police custody before him across the country. A memorial to Floyd featuring pictures, signs, flowers and artwork has grown to encompass the entirety of that intersection where Chicago Avenue and 38th Street meet. Dozens of demonstrators attended a prayer vigil there Monday afternoon. Gospel music filled an air already heavy with the smell of backyard grills from neighbors, and on street corners other residents distributed brown paper bags filled with food. The peaceful scene stood in stark contrast to the evening riots elsewhere in the Twin Cities the past week. Government officials pinned some of the destruction they caused on groups from outside the area with possible criminal ties. Speaking to demonstrators Monday, Terrence Floyd disavowed the destruction during an appearance where he called for justice on behalf of his brother. ""If I'm not out here messing up my community, what are you doing?"" he asked shortly after getting to his feet. Terrence Floyd traveled to Minneapolis on Monday from his hometown of Houston, where he and his brother were raised. Others demonstrating in the Twin Cities made similar journeys to protest Floyd's death. ""I drove here from the St. Louis area yesterday,"" said the Rev. Juard Barnes, who brought his wife and children. ""I came here to stand with our people and be part of a movement for racial and economic dignity. And this is in the center of that."" That so many would travel and congregate here at a time when a global pandemic continues to rage is striking. But many said they feel the need to do so given the history that preceded Floyd's death. For Jeanine Estime, who lives down the street from Cup Foods, seeing her neighborhood transform into a living memorial has been overwhelming. While she hasn't watched the video of Floyd's final moments herself, Estime said she was upset by what happened to him. The wider outrage is not over the death of ""one black guy,"" she said, but is an ""an outcry for justice."" Some protesters Monday said justice will not be served in its entirety until the three other former Minneapolis Police officers with Chauvin during George Floyd's arrest — J. Alexander Kueng, Tou Thao and Thomas Lane — are also arrested and charged. Elsewhere, in St. Paul, scores of protesters demonstrated outside of the Minnesota Governor's Residence to demand as much. Ellison, who will lead the case alongside Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman, has declined to say whether additional charges or arrests will be made or filed in the case.",0.0

Popovich, a staunch critic of Trump, views the president as a detriment to the country. listen live watch live ""He's not just divisive. He's a destroyer. To be in his presence makes you die,"" Popovich told The Nation sports editor Dave Zirin. ""He will eat you alive for his own purposes. I'm appalled that we have a leader who can't say 'black lives matter.' That's why he hides in the White House basement. He is a coward. ""He creates a situation and runs away like a grade-schooler. Actually, I think it's best to ignore him. There is nothing he can do to make this better because of who he is: a deranged idiot."" Popovich, who has won five NBA titles with the Spurs and ranks third all-time with 1,272 regular-season victories, said Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell are failing at leadership. ""It's so clear what needs to be done. We need a president to come out and say simply that 'black lives matter,'"" Popovich said. ""Just say those three words. But he won't and he can't. He can't because it's more important to him to mollify the small group of followers who validate his insanity. But it's more than just Trump. The system has to change. I'll do whatever I can do to help, because that's what leaders do. But he can't do anything to put us on a positive path, because he's not a leader. ""It's like what (Senators) Lindsay Graham and Ted Cruz used to say when they had the courage to say it: He's unfit. But they have chosen instead to be invisible and obsequious in the face of this carnage. In the end, what we have is a fool in place of a president, while the person who really runs the country, Senator Mitch McConnell, destroys the United States for generations to come. ""McConnell has destroyed and degraded our judicial system. He has tried to destroy heath care. He's destroyed the environment. He's the master and Trump's the stooge, and what's funny is that Trump doesn't even know it. Trump's always wanted to be part of the in-group, but McConnell is an in-group of one and Trump plays the fool."" As for the protests surrounding Floyd's death, Popovich said those are needed but he would like to see better organization. ""It's frustrating. When Dr. (Martin Luther) King did a protest, you knew when to show, when to come back the next day. But if you're just organizing protests and everyone is coming and going in every direction, it doesn't work that way. If it was nonviolent, they knew to be nonviolent, but this is muddled. ""More leadership would be very welcome so these incredible mass demonstrations can't be used by people for other means. We can limit the bad, but only if things are organized better."" The whole situation is frustrating to Popovich. ""We need change. The system has to change. I'm willing to do my part.""",0.0

PAUL — An overwhelmed Terrence Floyd fell to his knees and cried out in anguish on the street in front of Cup Foods in southeast Minneapolis on Monday, June 1, the spot where his brother George Floyd spent his final moments a week ago before dying in police custody. In the week since, untold scores of viewers have seen the footage of George Floyd's last breaths online and on the airwaves. That video, captured by a bystander to Floyd's arrest, would burn the image of a white police officer kneeling on his neck into the public consciousness and spark a wave of protests and civil unrest that have rocked the Twin Cities area and small and large communities beyond. Outrage over George Floyd's death has renewed calls for wider policing reforms. Amid sometimes violent riots that followed his death, calls for peace and justice have also been heard. But as Brooklyn, N.Y. civil rights leader, the Rev. Kevin McCall, who appeared alongside Terrence Floyd on Monday, pointed out to onlookers, ""you'll give us peace when you give us justice."" His words came a day after major developments in the case against former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, 44, who was filmed kneeling on Floyd's neck and fired in the aftermath, were announced. Officials on Sunday, May 31, announced that Chauvin, who has been charged with murder and manslaughter, will be prosecuted by a team led by Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison. listen live watch live And Monday, attorneys for Floyd's family released the results of an independent autopsy that listed his cause of death as asphyxiation. Also on Monday, the Hennepin County Medical Examiner's office declared Floyd's manner of death as homicide. Police initially said Floyd was sent to the hospital when he experienced medical distress during his arrest, which was made in the course of their response to a counterfeiting incident called in by Cup Foods on Monday. Prior to his arrest, Floyd was found in a car matching the description of one reported in the call to police. Whether Ellison's appointment to the case, something lawmakers and members of Floyd's family had called for, will quell further unrest in Minneapolis and St. Paul remains to be seen. But an ongoing curfew order appears to have been more widely adhered to on Sunday evening, when local authorities responded to fewer fires and incidents of property damage. What was clear from a visit to Cup Foods on Monday, however, was that a community is still mourning for George Floyd, 46, and the many other black Americans who have died in police custody before him across the country. A memorial to Floyd featuring pictures, signs, flowers and artwork has grown to encompass the entirety of that intersection where Chicago Avenue and 38th Street meet. Dozens of demonstrators attended a prayer vigil there Monday afternoon. Gospel music filled an air already heavy with the smell of backyard grills from neighbors, and on street corners other residents distributed brown paper bags filled with food. The peaceful scene stood in stark contrast to the evening riots elsewhere in the Twin Cities the past week. Government officials pinned some of the destruction they caused on groups from outside the area with possible criminal ties. Speaking to demonstrators Monday, Terrence Floyd disavowed the destruction during an appearance where he called for justice on behalf of his brother. ""If I'm not out here messing up my community, what are you doing?"" he asked shortly after getting to his feet. Terrence Floyd traveled to Minneapolis on Monday from his hometown of Houston, where he and his brother were raised. Others demonstrating in the Twin Cities made similar journeys to protest Floyd's death. ""I drove here from the St. Louis area yesterday,"" said the Rev. Juard Barnes, who brought his wife and children. ""I came here to stand with our people and be part of a movement for racial and economic dignity. And this is in the center of that."" That so many would travel and congregate here at a time when a global pandemic continues to rage is striking. But many said they feel the need to do so given the history that preceded Floyd's death. For Jeanine Estime, who lives down the street from Cup Foods, seeing her neighborhood transform into a living memorial has been overwhelming. While she hasn't watched the video of Floyd's final moments herself, Estime said she was upset by what happened to him. The wider outrage is not over the death of ""one black guy,"" she said, but is an ""an outcry for justice."" Some protesters Monday said justice will not be served in its entirety until the three other former Minneapolis Police officers with Chauvin during George Floyd's arrest — J. Alexander Kueng, Tou Thao and Thomas Lane — are also arrested and charged. Elsewhere, in St. Paul, scores of protesters demonstrated outside of the Minnesota Governor's Residence to demand as much. Ellison, who will lead the case alongside Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman, has declined to say whether additional charges or arrests will be made or filed in the case.",0.0

Lizzy Henderson, the leader of the Black Lives Matter protest which will demonstrate in Dickinson on Tuesday evening near the Prairie Hills Mall, said that the peaceful protest will take place at 5 p.m and she hoped to gather in unity with the community to bring awareness to the inequalities currently taking place within the United States. Henderson was clear and concise that the organization’s intentions are non-violent and are not intended to direct anger or target local police; rather the organization extended invitations to both the Dickinson Police Department and Stark County Sheriff’s Office to join the group as they seek to move towards change. “I want to keep this 100% as peaceful as possible,” Henderson said. “I want people to understand that when we say Black Lives Matter, we mean Black Lives Matter; we do not mean we’re targeting the cops.” Henderson added, “We’re not against [the police] we know that our police department in Dickinson did not do what their officer did [in Minneapolis]. That’s why I personally invited them to join us and stand with us for social injustice for George Floyd .… I want to get the message across that we want social equality and that we want to stand together as a community and not be divided.” Despite reassurances from police and organizers of the protest, Peggy O'Brien, general manager of the Prairie Hills Mall, is preparing for the potential for property damage or violence to occur.

Gather every bit of it' ...I've already talked to all of the tenants and I said, 'At my signal, you drop your gates. You drop your gates and lock them.' It's kind of hard because you want to protect everybody but yet you don't want the bad guys, if you will, to know that they've affected you and intimidated you."" O'Brien said she did not give permission for the protest to occur on her property. ""Their whole thing is that they're staying on the grass, and that's state and city, and it is. The first six feet off of the concrete, that's our property ... and then the rest of it toward the road, that's easement ... As soon as you overflow onto our property, I'm not okay with that,"" she said. Despite the objections from O’Brien, protestors are still planning to gather outside the Prairie Hills Mall at 5 p.m. on Tuesday to exercise their first amendment rights with law enforcement presence throughout. Protestors will have signs and use their voices to bring awareness to the situation. Henderson added the goal is for everyone to feel welcomed and appreciated at the event while bringing awareness in a peaceful manner. “We plan on going until 8 or 8:30,” Henderson said. “If some people don’t get off work until late and they want to stay later, that’s their freedom and they can do that.” News of the protests spreading online generated mixed feelings among citizens with some lauding the protests as progress and others expressing their displeasure with the thought of a protest happening in Dickinson. Dassinger mentioned in a statement that DPD has taken notice and is prepared to keep the situation peaceful. “The First Amendment grants the right to protest and is the foundation of American democracy,” Dassinger said. “As public servants, we are equally committed to ensuring the safety and wellbeing of our residents and businesses.”",0.0

Matthew Lee Rupert, 28, posted messages on Facebook on Thursday about the protests in the Twin Cities over Floyd’s death and wrote, “I’m going to Minneapolis tomorrow who coming only goons I’m renting hotel rooms,” according to the criminal complaint. He is from Galesburg, Ill., which is about 45 miles from Peoria. Gov. Tim Walz talked on Saturday about people coming from outside Minnesota, fueling destruction and rioting in the Twin Cities, but has said in following up that “there’s a lot more investigating to be done.” Some people who have been arrested are from out of state, but most gave authorities Minnesota addresses. Who are the outside agitators coming in? “There’s a lot of rumors and there’s a lot of stuff up on social media, and that we are feeding that to our intelligence units to try to see if we can validate or vet any of those,” Minnesota Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington said Sunday. “At this point I don’t have any credible evidence of any specific group being here in Minnesota. I have lots of people calling me saying ‘Have you heard?,’ but I have not had anybody that can actually bring me evidence … that actually validates that.” Charges filed On Friday, Rupert posted a live video to Facebook, indicating he was in Minneapolis. He said, “They got SWAT trucks up there … I’ve got some bombs if some of you all want to throw them back … bomb them back,” according to the complaint. Soon after, he said, “Light that (expletive) and throw it at them.” Rupert asked for lighter fluid before going in a Sprint store and then said, in the video, “I lit it on fire,” after which he went in a nearby Office Depot and filmed himself taking items from the store, the complaint said. The U.S. attorney’s office in Minnesota charged Rupert with civil disorder, carrying on a riot and possession of unregistered destructive devices. An attorney for Rupert was not listed in the court record. On Saturday, Rupert posted messages on Facebook saying he was heading to Chicago, “We will be back bro we can loot til 2:30,” the complaint said. Early on Sunday, Rupert posted multiple videos on Facebook showing him in Chicago, wearing an American flag bandanna and baseball cap, and saying, “Let’s start a riot” and “I’m going to start doing some damage,” according to the complaint. Chicago police arrested him about 2:20 a.m. Sunday for violating the city’s emergency curfew order. Officers found explosive devices in his vehicle, along with a hammer, a heavy-duty flashlight and cash, the complaint continued. Rupert was taken into federal custody on Monday in Chicago. The FBI is asking the public to report suspected arson, use of explosive devices, or violent, destructive acts associated with the otherwise peaceful protests of the last week by calling 800-CALLFBI (800-225-5324), or providing pictures or videos at fbi.gov/violence.",0.0

Social media has been swirling with questions and rumors regarding curfews in Bemidji, potential dumpster fires and what the mayor described as ""vigilantes” since Saturday's protest. An evening curfew was enacted for Bemidji on Saturday and Sunday following a “specific series of credible threats to property and people,” and not in response to the peaceful protest, according to a statement from Mayor Rita Albrecht. Various speculations and questions have since been raised via social media and residents have sent in screenshots to the Bemidji Pioneer of since-deleted posts, including mention of state Rep. Matt Grossell, R-Clearbrook, participating in patrolling the city with the owner of Off Grid Armory, a business located near Itasca State Park. In a press release Monday, Beltrami County Sheriff Ernie Beitel addressed some of the rumors and misinformation that has been “engulfing our community surrounding law enforcement's response to the credible, evidence-based threats to the City of Bemidji, its citizens and its businesses that occurred this past weekend.” According to Beitel, on Friday, May 29, law enforcement officials were alerted that extremist organizations planned to infiltrate the peaceful protests scheduled to take place on Saturday in Bemidji, including starting fires. These extremist organizations have not been named by law enforcement. listen live watch live Throughout Saturday, law enforcement continued to receive threats related to ""burning Bemidji down,"" specifically toward burning down the Beltrami County/Bemidji Police Department law enforcement center, the release said. Beitel claimed his fears “were justified” after law enforcement found “multiple dumpsters filled with gas accelerants and caches of tools hidden,” were found around the downtown area. Mayor Albrecht’s statement, released on Sunday, also said that “dumpsters were found to have already been laid with accelerants (gas) and flammables (bags of leaves and broken up pallets).” Waste Management was called to empty dumpsters at 6 p.m. Saturday in downtown Bemidji, Beitel said. On Saturday afternoon, the planned peaceful demonstration began at 2 p.m. with speakers and music before protesters walked to the law enforcement center, about five blocks from where the demonstration began. The demonstration remained mostly peaceful until a dozen protesters surrounded and threw debris at a squad car. Beitel said the person was immediately arrested. “The organizers of the peaceful citizen's march were able to step in, calm and dispersed most of the crowd and stopped any more damage from occurring,” the release said. The first floor windows of the center then were boarded up, and law enforcement called for mutual aid from other agencies. “Many of the law enforcement officers that responded and patrolled the streets of Bemidji were doing so in dark SUV squad cars,” Beitel said. “At no time did the Beltrami County Sheriff's Office or Bemidji Police Department call for private security or citizens to assist our law enforcement response as it has been stated on several social media platforms and statements made by government officials.” “Unbeknownst to myself or (Bemidji Police) Chief (Mike) Mastin we learned that some business owners, and citizens, including State Representative Matt Grossell had offered to assist and were with local law enforcement officers and a neighboring sheriff at a Bemidji Fire Station,” he added. Grossell is a retired law enforcement officer, having served as a Clearwater County sheriff's deputy. A Republican from Clearbrook representing District 2A, Grossell made statewide news when he was issued citations for disorderly conduct and trespassing last August in St. Paul, but reached an agreement allowing him to avoid convictions and instead participate in a six-month court diversion program. “At approximately 9:30 p.m., Representative Grossell reached out to me and offered assistance by being ‘eyes and ears’ for law enforcement,” Beitel explained. Grossell did not respond to a request for comment Monday. The sheriff said his office also received information that buses filled with protestors were headed to Bemidji, so when Grossell called him, Beitel said ""I intentionally directed him outside the city limits to watch for buses that may be coming into Bemidji and report his observations to law enforcement. Unfortunately, a miscommunication resulted in some of the citizens placed in fringe locations around the city of Bemidji.” That statement contrasts with Albrecht’s Sunday statement, in which she said, “We are aware of multiple inaccurate rumors on social media that can lead to misunderstandings and violence. The city did not request, nor do we condone, vigilantes patrolling within the city limits, now or any time."" A now-deleted Facebook post from Off Grid Armory, posted at 10:30 p.m. Saturday, said, “I’m sitting in a blacked out SUV here in Bemidji with a bunch of patriots to make sure this town doesn’t get burned down or looted like Minneapolis… We started off at the police station where we met protestors. Now we are posted up in (five) locations in town, making sure none of the Minneapolis shenanigans take place here!” According to the Off Grid Armory website, the mission of the business is: “We believe in keeping our communities safe. Teaching others responsible ways of handling firearms and personal protective equipment is the most important way we can help contribute to the safety of our loved ones.” When asked to comment on the public statements regarding the situation, Samuel Smith, the owner of Off Grid Armory said, “We would like a public apology from the mayor of Bemidji Rita Albrecht, for publicly calling business owners in Bemidji vigilantes.” Beitel said in his statement, “These citizens did not actively patrol city streets, further, we do not share their personal views as they have expressed on social media.”",0.0

President Donald Trump departs the White House to visit outside St. John's Church, Monday, June 1, 2020, in Washington. Part of the church was set on fire during protests on Sunday night. (Source: AP Photo/Patrick Semansky) Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker said he doesn't believe the federal government can send military troops into his state. He accused the president of creating an ""incendiary moment"" by threatening to do just that to quell violence that has arisen as demonstrators have taken to the streets in reaction to the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. ""I reject the notion that the federal government can send troops into the state of Illinois,"" Pritzker said on CNN after Trump urged governors to deploy the Guard. If they did not, he said he would send in ""thousands and thousands"" of soldiers. Pritzker was among the first governors to react to Trump's comments, which came hours after the president called governors ""weak"" and urged them to take a more aggressive response to weekend violence. It came as Americans gathered to protest police brutality against black Americans following the killing of Floyd, who was handcuffed and on the ground pleading for air as a white police officer pressed a knee on his neck for several minutes. Some demonstrations have turned violent, with people breaking into and stealing from businesses, smashing car windows and setting fires. In New York, Gov. Andrew Cuomo has not deployed the state's National Guard to New York City, although he said earlier Monday the state had 13,000 troops that ""we can use at any moment."" ""I say thank you but no thank you,"" Cuomo said on CNN about Trump's call to send military troops to the states. At least 23 states and the District of Columbia had already deployed guard troops as of Monday morning, according to a statement from the National Guard. It wasn't clear whether the action would be enough to satisfy the president. Trump took no questions from reporters and did not say how he would decide whether a state's response was sufficient. Democratic Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington, who has activated the state's guard, said in a statement he prays ""no soldier and no civilian is injured or killed by this reckless fit."" ""This president has repeatedly proven he is incapable of governing and shown nothing but false bravado throughout the chaos that has accompanied his time in office,"" Inslee said in a statement. Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak, also a Democrat, said any suggestions the state's National Guard is ill equipped to handle the states needs is ""misinformed."" ""As the Commander In Chief of the Nevada National Guard I can state, categorically, that they have done their duty to protect all Nevadans, and will continue to do so."" In neighboring Oregon, Gov. Kate Brown said the violence is being perpetrated by a small segment of demonstrators. She refused to deploy the National Guard on Sunday at Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler's request because she was concerned it would escalate a tense situation, but on Monday activated 50 unarmed guard members in support roles. ""You don't defuse violence by putting soldiers on the streets,"" Brown, a Democrat, said earlier Monday in reaction to Trump's comments about governors being weak in their response. ""Trump wants governors to deploy the National Guard as a show of force to intimidate the public. I want to ensure that the public can safely raise their voices in this much-needed call for reform."" She didn't immediately comment on Trump's remarks about deploying the U.S. military. Nor did California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who has deployed thousands of guard troops to Los Angeles and other cities. He called Trump's morning comments ""noise"" and avoided addressing them directly, although he said the nation is desperate for leadership. Guard members can assist law enforcement and perform duties such as traffic control, communications support and extinguishing fires. __ Associated Press writers Gillian Flaccus in Portland, Oregon, Rachel La Corte in Olympia, Washington, and Michelle Price in Las Vegas contributed to this report.

Ahead of Sunday’s gathering, Minot Police Chief John Klug released a statement in which he indicated officers would NOT interfere with the protest. We spoke with Chief Klug to see how the protest went and how his department works toward maintaining a trustworthy relationship within the community, in tonight’s top story. Chief Klug said the Minot Police Department trusted the community to have a peaceful protest and that trust is well-deserved. “We were just ready to respond if it did turn into something that had violence, or there was any property being destroyed or anything like that. But, it was a good event and I’m glad it turned out the way it did,” Klug said. Klug said his department works hard at maintaining a good relationship with the community. In the past, they’ve done things like “Coffee with a Cop” to have a chance for the public to feel comfortable around police officers. “With the COVID-19 response and shutting all those events down, we have to get a little more creative and maybe that is finding an open forum like they have in the park where we can just speak and answer questions that people have,” Klug said. Another way the department works to build trust is the yearly training officers go through to make sure they don’t get complacent on the job. “When they’re getting a little bit too pulled in to an incident, getting a little bit too emotional, another officer has to step in and they have to say, ‘You know what? Step back, I’ll take care of this.’ And that didn’t happen in the incident that sparked this whole thing. We have to be accountable for ourselves, we have to be accountable for each other and we need the community to trust us,” said Klug. Klug wants the community to know that what happened in Minneapolis didn’t have to happen. “Our community should know that we won’t stand for anything that is racially motivated in our community. So if our officers act out, based on that, they’re going to be held accountable,” Klug said. His goal is to make sure the MPD is trustworthy and does its best to serve and protect. Klug added that the peaceful protest in Minot showed that the people of the city DO appreciate and respect police.",0.0

Amid racial unrest across the nation, President Donald Trump on Monday declared himself ""the president of law and order"" and threatened to deploy the United States military to American cities to quell a rise of violent protests. As Trump spoke, an incredible TV split screen developed around the White House. While he addressed the nation in the White House's idyllic Rose Garden, a series of military vehicles rolled out front on Pennsylvania Avenue and military police and law enforcement clashed with protesters at Lafayette Park. Those peaceful demonstrators were cleared so Trump could walk across the park to St. John's Episcopal Church, known as ""The Church of the Presidents,"" which suffered fire damage in a protest this week. Holding a Bible, he then stood with several of his Cabinet members as the cameras clicked. ""We have the greatest country in the world,"" Trump declared. ""We're going to keep it safe."" Trump said he would mobilize ""thousands and thousands"" of soldiers to keep the peace if governors did not use the National Guard to shut down the protests. Loud tear gas explosions could be heard as authorities moved what appeared to be peaceful protests in the park. The escalation came just after Attorney General William Barr came to the park to to survey the demonstrators. According to senior defense officials, between 600 and 800 National Guard members from five states were being sent to Washington to provide assistance. Those troops were either already on the ground or will arrive by midnight. Under the Civil War-era Posse Comitatus Act, federal troops are prohibited from performing domestic law enforcement actions such as making arrests, seizing property or searching people. In extreme cases, however, the president can invoke the Insurrection Act, also from the Civil War, which allows the use of active-duty or National Guard troops for law enforcement. The officials said that some of the National Guard in D.C. will be armed and others will not. They said that the D.C. guard members do not have non-lethal weapons. The military police that are visible in the city are members of the Guard. ——————- THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP's original story is below. —————————————— President Donald Trump on Monday derided many governors as ""weak"" and demanded tougher crackdowns on burning and stealing among some demonstrations in the aftermath of violent protests in dozens of American cities. Trump spoke to governors on a video teleconference that also included law enforcement and national security officials, telling the state leaders they ""have to get much tougher."" ""Most of you are weak,"" Trump said. ""You have to arrest people."" The days of protests were triggered by the death of George Floyd, a black man who died when a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee into Floyd's neck for several minutes even after he stopped moving and pleading for air. The demonstrations turned violent in several cities, with people trashing stores, smashing and burning police cars and igniting fires in historic Lafayette Park across from the White House. Accused by critics of doing too little to defuse the crisis, Trump was to address the nation early Monday evening. The president urged the governors to deploy the National Guard, which he credited for helping calm the situation Sunday night in Minneapolis. He demanded that similarly tough measures be taken in cities that also experienced violence, including New York, Philadelphia and Los Angeles. ""You've got to arrest people, you have to track people, you have to put them in jail for 10 years and you'll never see this stuff again,"" said Trump. ""We're doing it in Washington, D.C. We're going to do something that people haven't seen before."" The president told the governors they were making themselves ""look like fools"" for not calling up more of the National Guard as a show for force on city streets. Attorney General Bill Barr, who was also on the call, told governors that a joint terrorist task force would be used to track agitators and urged local officials to ""dominate"" the streets and control, not react to crowds. He urged the governors to ""go after troublemakers."" Trump's angry exhortations at the nation's governors came after a Sunday night of escalating violence, images of fires and looting and clashes with police filling the nation's airwaves and overshadowing the largely peaceful protests. The protests had grown so heated Friday night that the Secret Service rushed the president to an underground bunker previously used during terrorist attacks. On Monday, Trump also spoke of trying to criminalize flag-burning. The Supreme Court has conservative new members since it last ruled on that issue, and Trump said that ""I think it's time to review that again."" He continued his effort to project strength, using inflammatory tweets and delivering partisan attacks. As cities have burned night after night and images of violence have dominated television coverage, Trump's advisers have discussed the prospect of an Oval Office address in an attempt to ease tensions. The notion was quickly scrapped for lack of policy proposals and the president's own seeming disinterest in delivering a message of unity. Trump did not appear in public on Sunday and was not scheduled to on Monday either. The demonstrations in Washington appeared to catch officers by surprise. They sparked one of the highest alerts at the White House complex since the Sept. 11 attacks in 2001. Trump has told advisers he worries about his safety, while both privately and publicly praising the work of the Secret Service. Demonstrators returned Sunday afternoon, facing off against police at Lafayette Park into the evening. Trump retweeted a message from a conservative commentator encouraging authorities to respond with greater force. ""This isn't going to stop until the good guys are willing to use overwhelming force against the bad guys,"" Buck Sexton wrote in a message amplified by the president. In recent days security at the White House has been reinforced by the National Guard and additional personnel from the Secret Service and the U.S. Park Police. The Justice Department deployed members of the U.S. Marshals Service and agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration to supplement National Guard troops outside the White House, according to a senior Justice Department official. The official could not discuss the matter publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity.",0.0

A woman holds a sign addressing ANTIFA at a protest in Los Angeles on Monday, June 1, 2020, over the death of George Floyd, who died May 25 in Minneapolis. (Source: AP Photo/Christian Monterrosa) A look at what antifa is and is not: WHAT IS ANTIFA? Short for ""anti-fascists,"" antifa is not a single organization but rather an umbrella term for far-left-leaning militant groups that confront or resist neo-Nazis and white supremacists at demonstrations. There is no hierarchical structure to antifa or universal set of tactics that makes its presence immediately recognizable, though members tend to espouse revolutionary and anti-authoritarian views, said Mark Bray, a historian at Rutgers University and author of ""Antifa: The Anti-Fascist Handbook."" ""They do different things at different times in different ways, some of which there is evidence of them breaking the law. Other times there is not,"" Bray said. Literature from the antifa movement encourages followers to pursue lawful protest activity as well as more confrontational acts, according to a 2018 Congressional Research Service report. The literature suggests that followers monitor the activities of white supremacist groups, publicize online the personal information of perceived enemies, develop self-defense training regimens and compel outside organizations to cancel any speakers or events with ""a fascist bent,"" the report said. People associated with antifa have been present for significant demonstrations and counter-demonstrations over the last three years, sometimes involving brawls and property damage. They mobilized against a white supremacist march in Charlottesville, Virginia, in August 2017 and have clashed repeatedly with far-right groups in Portland, Oregon, including at a protest and counter-demonstration last summer that resulted in arrests and the seizure of shields, poles and other weapons. WHAT ROLE IS ANTIFA PLAYING IN THESE DEMONSTRATIONS? Trump and members of his administration have singled out antifa as being responsible for the violence at protests triggered by the killing of George Floyd, a black man who died after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes even after Floyd stopped moving and pleading for air. In a pair of statements over the weekend, Attorney General William Barr described ""antifa-like tactics"" by out-of-state agitators and said antifa was instigating violence and engaging in ""domestic terrorism"" and would be dealt with accordingly. At a White House appearance Monday, Trump blamed antifa by name for the violence, along with violent mobs, arsonists and looters. White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany told reporters earlier in the day that antifa is a ""big element of this protest,"" though she deferred to the Justice Department on the question of how one could be identified as a member. But it's unclear how big its involvement is. Bray said that although he believes people associated with antifa are participating in the demonstrations, it is difficult to establish how big of a role they're playing since there is no official roster of members and since the movement lacks the numbers to mobilize nationwide in such a dramatic, forceful way. ""The radical left is much bigger than antifa— much, much bigger — and the number of people who are participating in the property destruction are much, much bigger than the radical left,"" Bray said. Others have seen evidence of right-wing extremists. WHAT DOES THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION WANT TO DO ABOUT ANTIFA? Trump tweeted Sunday, ""The United States of America will be designating ANTIFA as a Terrorist Organization."" It's not the first time he's endorsed that approach. Trump expressed a similar sentiment last summer, joining some Republican lawmakers in calling for antifa to be designated as a terror organization after the skirmishes in Portland. CAN THE ADMINISTRATION DO THAT? For one thing, antifa is not a discrete or centralized group, so it's unclear how the government could give it a designation. Beyond that, though, antifa is a domestic entity and, as such, not a candidate for inclusion on the State Department's list of foreign terror organizations. Those groups, which include Islamic extremist organizations and the Real Irish Republican Army, are based overseas rather than in the U.S. That designation matters for a variety of legal reasons, not least of which anyone in the United States who lends material support to an organization on that list is subject to terrorism-related charges. But ""there is not a domestic equivalent,"" said Joshua Geltzer, a former senior counterterrorism official in the Obama White House and founding executive director at the Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection at the Georgetown University Law Center. There have been periodic calls, particularly after mass shootings by white supremacists, to establish a domestic terrorism law. But no singular domestic terrorism statute now exists. Asked Monday what legal authority the president would have for labeling antifa a terror organization, McEnany pointed to the existing statute under the U.S. criminal code that defines acts of domestic and international terrorism. But defining an act of terrorism is different than designating an entire U.S. group as a terror organization. ""US law does the 1st. It doesn't permit the 2nd,"" Geltzer tweeted after McEnany's remarks. Even if antifa is not a designated terror organization, FBI Director Chris Wray has made clear that it's on the radar of federal law enforcement. He has said that while the FBI does not investigate on the basis of ideology, agents have pursued investigations across the country against people motivated to commit crimes and acts of violence ""on kind of an antifa ideology."" ___ Associated Press writers Gillian Flaccus in Portland, Ore., and Aamer Madhani in Washington contributed to this report.

Before the group could reach their destination near downtown, a pair of Cass County sheriff's deputies intercepted them and let them know it might be best if they just went home. And that's what they did, said Cass County Sheriff Jesse Jahner. A posting on the Fargo Police Department's Facebook page Saturday night said dispatchers received a call about 8:25 p.m. regarding men carrying assault rifles. The post included a photo and said the men told deputies they were headed to protect businesses. listen live watch live Because the men carried the firearms openly, the deputies determined they were not doing anything illegal, Jahner said. However, the sheriff added, given the situation authorities were dealing with, the deputies told the group: ""Hey, listen: This isn't a good idea. If you do this, someone is going to get hurt. Our officers down there don't know who you are.''' Jahner said the men indicated they understood and made the decision to return home. An emergency declaration made by Fargo Mayor Tim Mahoney Saturday night temporarily banned the carrying of weapons like knives and arrows. However, city rules regarding emergencies purposefully do not list guns among prohibited weapons. That's because a state law allows the lawful possession of guns during a declared emergency. Jahner said the armed party was probably legally able to continue on its way, but added it's likely public safety was better served by the decision not to. ""What it came down to was our guys having good verbal skills, to really explain everything and just say, 'Here's what could happen, and we really don't want to put anyone in a situation like that,''' Jahner said. Jesse Gatheridge contacted The Forum late Monday to say he was part of the group involved and added they were not planning to go anywhere that would create confusion or issues for authorities. He said they had been heading for a friend's business which is near the Fargo police station, which they thought might become a target of rioters.",0.0

(Source: AP Photo/Noah Berger) But most protests passed peacefully, and while there were scattered reports of looting in New York City, the country appeared calmer by late Tuesday than it did a day earlier, when violence swept through multiple cities. The president, meanwhile, amplified his hard-line calls from Monday, when he threatened to send in the military to restore order if governors didn't do it. ""NYC, CALL UP THE NATIONAL GUARD,"" he tweeted. ""The lowlifes and losers are ripping you apart. Act fast!"" One day after a crackdown on peaceful protesters near the White House, thousands of demonstrators massed a block away from the presidential mansion, facing law enforcement personnel standing behind a black chain-link fence. The fence was put up overnight to block access to Lafayette Park, just across the street from the White House. ""Last night pushed me way over the edge,"" said Jessica DeMaio, 40, of Washington, who attended a Floyd protest Tuesday for the first time. ""Being here is better than being at home feeling helpless."" The crowd remained in place after the city's 7 p.m. curfew passed, defying warnings that the response from law enforcement could be even more forceful. But the protest lacked the tension of the previous nights' demonstrations. The crowd Tuesday was peaceful, even polite. At one point, the crowd booed when a protester climbed a light post and took down a street sign. A chant went up: ""Peaceful protest!"" On Monday, law enforcement officers on foot and horseback aggressively drove protesters away from Lafayette Park, clearing the way for President Donald Trump to do a photo op at nearby St. John's Church. On Tuesday, pastors at the church prayed with demonstrators and handed out water bottles. Protests ranged across the U.S., including in Los Angeles, Miami, St. Paul, Minnesota, Columbia, South Carolina, and Houston, where the police chief talked to peaceful demonstrators, vowing reforms. ""God as my witness, change is coming,"" Art Acevedo said. ""And we're going to do it the right way."" In New York, midtown Manhattan was pocked with battered storefronts after Monday's protests. Macy's flagship store was among those hit when crowds of people smashed windows and looted stores as they swept through the area. Police made nearly 700 arrests and Mayor Bill de Blasio extended an 8 p.m. curfew all week. ""We're going to have a tough few days,"" he warned, but added: ""We're going to beat it back."" He pleaded with community leaders to step forward and ""create peace."" Thousands of protesters marched Tuesday night in a string of demonstrations across Manhattan and Brooklyn after merchants boarded up their businesses, fearing a repeat of the night before. Many people remained on the streets after the curfew hour. Police eventually ordered them to move along and began taking some into custody. More than 20,000 National Guard members have been called up in 29 states to deal with the violence. New York is not among them, and de Blasio has said he does not want the Guard. On Tuesday, Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo called what happened in the city ""a disgrace."" ""The NYPD and the mayor did not do their job last night,"" Cuomo said at a briefing in Albany. He said the mayor underestimated the problem, and the nation's largest police force was not deployed in sufficient numbers, though the city had said it doubled the usual police presence. Tuesday marked the eighth straight night of the protests, which began in Minneapolis, where Floyd died, and quickly spread across the country. The mother of George Floyd's 6-year-old daughter, Gianna, said she wanted the world to know that her little girl lost a good father. ""I want everybody to know that this is what those officers took,"" Roxie Washington said during a Minneapolis news conference with her young daughter at her side. ""I want justice for him because he was good. No matter what anybody thinks, he was good."" On Monday, scattered violence flared in multiple protests, including an officer who was shot and gravely wounded outside a Las Vegas hotel and casino, and four officers shot in St. Louis. They were expected to recover. About a dozen other deaths have been reported around the country over the past week. And nearly 8,000 people nationwide have been arrested, according to a count by The Associated Press. Some protesters framed the burgeoning movement as a necessity after a string of killings by police. ""It feels like it's just been an endless cascade of hashtags of black people dying, and it feels like nothing's really being done by our political leaders to actually enact real change,"" said Christine Ohenzuwa, 19, who attended a peaceful protest at the Minnesota state Capitol in St. Paul. ""There's always going to be a breaking point. I think right now, we're seeing the breaking point around the country."" ""I live in this state. It's really painful to see what's going on, but it's also really important to understand that it's connected to a system of racial violence,"" she said. Meanwhile, governors and mayors, Republicans and Democrats alike, rejected Trump's threat to send in the military, with some saying troops would be unnecessary and others questioning whether the government has such authority and warning that such a step would be dangerous. ""Denver is not Little Rock in 1957, and Donald Trump is not President Eisenhower. This is a time for healing, for bringing people together, and the best way to protect civil rights is to move away from escalating violence,"" Colorado Gov. Jared Polis and Denver Mayor Michael Hancock, both Democrats, said in a statement, referring to Eisenhower's use of troops to enforce school desegregation in the South. A senior White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that the president is not rushing to send in the military and that his goal was to pressure governors to deploy more National Guard members. Such use of the military would mark a stunning federal intervention rarely seen in modern American history. Amid the protests, nine states and the District of Columbia held presidential primaries that tested the nation's ability to run elections while balancing a pandemic and sweeping social unrest. Joe Biden won hundreds more delegates and was on the cusp of formally securing the Democratic presidential nomination. Also Tuesday, Minnesota opened an investigation into whether the Minneapolis Police Department has a pattern of discrimination against minorities. Floyd died May 25 after a white Minneapolis officer, Derek Chauvin, pressed his knee on the handcuffed black man's neck for several minutes. Chauvin has been charged with murder. Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said prosecutors are working as fast as they can to determine if the three other officers at the scene should be charged too. All four have been fired. ___ Sullivan reported from Minneapolis. Associated Press journalists across the U.S. contributed to this report. Copyright 2020 Associated Press. All rights reserved.",0.0

The 29-year-old officer in Las Vegas was shot as police tried to disperse a large crowd of protesters in front of a casino shuttered because of the coronavirus. At about the same time and less than three miles (4.8 kilometers) away, police outside a federal courthouse shot a protester who was wearing a black tactical vest and armed with two handguns and a rifle. Police said the man was shot as he reached for a firearm. In other violence around the country, four officers were shot and wounded in Missouri and others in New York were hurt when a car plowed into a line of police. ""With these protests, which are leading to riots, one tragedy is only leading to another,"" said Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo, who heads the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department. The incidents came amid chaotic scenes that followed peaceful protests over the killing of Floyd, police brutality and racism. A number of cities have seen heavy-handed riot tactics by police and clashes between officers and demonstrators. On Monday night, as protests started to dwindle in St. Louis, four officers standing in a line were shot and injured when someone opened fire. All four were expected to recover. In the same city several hours later, police said four officers in a marked police car were fired on by men in a car. Police in Buffalo, New York, said an SUV broke through a police blockade at a protest and ran over a state trooper, breaking his leg and shattering his pelvis. Another trooper and a Buffalo police officer were also hit by the vehicle and treated for minor injuries. In Madison, Wisconsin, police Chief Vic Wahl said police officers were struck with rocks and projectiles. Over the weekend, police in Los Angeles reported rocks and other objects rained down on police at a demonstration near an outdoor mall, leaving one officer with a fractured skull. In Oakland, California, violence Friday night left 13 officers injured and a federal officer was fatally shot from an unidentified vehicle while providing security at a courthouse during a protest. Dave Patrick Underwood, 53, died and another officer was critically wounded, authorities said. Lombardo said officers in Las Vegas were being hit by rocks and bottles when a shot rang out and the officer, Shay Kellin Mikalonis, went down on the casino-lined Las Vegas Strip. Police said Mikalonis, a Las Vegas police officer for four years, was shot from across the street and 20-year-old Edgar Samaniego of Las Vegas was identified by video before he was later arrested on suspicion of the shooting. Jail and court records showed Samaniego was being held pending an initial court appearance on attempted murder and weapon charges. An attorney who represented Samaniego in a personal injury lawsuit in 2016 declined to comment, saying he was not immediately representing him on the criminal charges. Deputy Police Chief Chris Jones told reporters the man killed by police near the courthouse, 25-year-old Jorge Gomez of Las Vegas, had one of his three handguns mounted in what Jones called a ""carbine conversion kit"" that officials say made it resemble a rifle. Gomez remained near the courthouse after police ordered what the deputy chief called ""rowdy"" demonstrators to disperse, and was hit several times with beanbag projectiles before he was shot as he raised a gun toward officers who were helping an officer on the ground, Jones said. Lombardo and local officials pleaded multiple times in recent days for events to remain peaceful. They have so far resisted calls to impose a curfew in Las Vegas. Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak said Tuesday he was praying for the ""officer who was senselessly shot"" and ""all of the communities across Nevada who are experiencing grief and pain."" ""It's during these trying times we must remind ourselves that creating a state where justice and peace exist together in partnership, not as a binary choice, is the goal we must all work toward,"" he said. Sisolak said he was activating ""additional"" members of the Nevada National Guard to support state and local law enforcement at the protests. He initially deployed the Guard over the weekend. The governor's office said the Guard units would not be making arrests or doing crowd control but would ""focus on protecting critical facilities, preserving public safety, and allowing individuals to exercise their rights to peacefully demonstrate."" Monday's protest began near President Donald Trump's non-casino hotel, Trump International Tower, just off the Las Vegas Strip and remained peaceful for more than four hours. ""All night long, everybody worked hard to keep everybody safe,"" said U.S. Marshal Gary Schofield, head of the local federal security agency involved with police in the shooting in front of the courthouse.

Another was a man known as “Mr. Indianapolis,"" a former star football player. Yet another was a federal officer working security during a protest. Several thousand demonstrators gather in Oakland, Calif., on Monday, June 1, 2020, to protest the death of George Floyd, who died after being restrained by Minneapolis police officers on May 25. (Source: AP Photo/Noah Berger) They are among those killed as protests have roiled American cities in the week since the death of George Floyd, a black man who pleaded for air as a white Minneapolis officer jammed a knee into his neck. The deaths have at times been overshadowed by the shocking images of unrest, from heavy-handed police tactics to violence, vandalism and arson. Tens of thousands have marched peacefully in demonstrations against police brutality and racism. Many of the people killed were African Americans, compounding the tragedy for black communities. Dozens of others have been injured in the chaos, with police officers getting shot and protesters struck with rubber bullets. The death toll and circumstances of the killings are still being sorted out in many cities, but here is what we know so far: LOUISVILLE As police and the National Guard troops sought to clear a crowd Monday, they heard gunshots and returned fire, killing David McAtee, the owner of a barbecue restaurant. The mayor fired the police chief after finding out officers did not turn on their body-worn cameras. State police and the U.S. attorney also are investigating. McAtee was a 53-year-old African American man known for offering free meals to officers who stopped by his restaurant. “We lost a wonderful citizen named David McAtee,” Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer said. “David was a friend to many, a well-known barbecue man.” Acting police Chief Robert Schroeder said Tuesday that video from security cameras at McAtee’s business and an adjoining store showed McAtee firing a gun as officers approached. “This video does not provide all the answers. But we are releasing it to provide transparency. It does not answer every question, including why did he fire and where were police at the time he fired,” Schroeder said. The protests in Louisville have centered not just on Floyd’s killing but also the death of Breonna Taylor, a black woman killed in her home in Louisville in March. The 26-year-old EMT was shot eight times by narcotics detectives who knocked down her front door as they tried to serve a search warrant. No drugs were found. ___ OAKLAND, CALIFORNIA A federal law enforcement officer was providing security at a federal courthouse during a protest when someone fired shots from a vehicle. Dave Patrick Underwood, 53, died and another officer was critically wounded. It was not immediately clear if the drive-by shooting was related to the protests, though the federal building’s glass doors were smashed and the front entrance was sprayed with anti-police graffiti. Underwood, who was black, and the other officer were contracted security officers employed by the Department of Homeland Security’s Federal Protective Service. They were monitoring a nearby protest. No one has been arrested, and a motive for the shooting has not yet been determined. Underwood was the brother of Angela Underwood Jacobs, recently a Republican candidate to fill a vacant U.S. congressional seat north of Los Angeles. ___ INDIANAPOLIS Two people were killed this past weekend amid unrest, including 38-year-old Chris Beaty, a former offensive lineman for Indiana University. Beaty was known as “Mr. Indianapolis"" and remained involved with the Hoosiers long after graduating. He also was a prominent businessman in the city, running multiple nightclubs. “I am at a loss for words. The news of the passing of Chris Beaty is just devastating,” coach Tom Allen said in a statement. “Since I returned home to coach at Indiana, Chris embraced me, encouraged me and supported me! His passion for life and Indiana Football energized me every time we were together."" The circumstances of his shooting weren't immediately clear, but some media reports said it happened near his apartment. This death occurred the same night an 18-year-old man was fatally shot as protests erupted in the city. ___ DAVENPORT, IOWA Police are investigating the deaths of 22-year-old Italia Kelly, who was shot Monday while leaving a protest outside a Walmart, and of a man found near where suspects exchanged gunfire with police in the city of 100,000 people across the Mississippi River from Illinois. The circumstances of Kelly’s death are murky, and no arrests have been made. Kelly and a friend were getting in a vehicle to leave because the protest had turned unruly when she was struck in the back by a bullet, said her aunt, Amy Hale of Atchison, Kansas. “She was always smiling, always laughing. That’s why it’s so sad that she was taken in such a violent way,” Hale said. “That is not Italia. She was the bright, bubbly big personality in the room.” Separately, authorities said an officer patrolling Sunday was “ambushed” with gunfire. Another officer shot back, and the suspects fled. Their vehicle crashed, and they were arrested. Near where the officer was shot, police found a man dead from a gunshot next to a vehicle. Police say they found a handgun underneath his body. His identity has not been released. Police said surveillance video shows that the man and some of the arrested suspects were involved in a shooting outside a jewelry store hours earlier. They were casing the business when other cars arrived and multiple people fired shots at each other and fled, police said. ___ MINNEAPOLIS In what is believed to be the first killing since the protests broke out, Calvin L. Horton Jr. was fatally shot outside a pawn shop last week. The owner of the pawn shop, who is white, was arrested in the death of Horton, a 43-year-old black man. Police say they are investigating the circumstances of the killing, including whether it was related to protests in the neighborhood. The shop was described as having been significantly damaged during the unrest. ___ OMAHA, NEBRASKA James Scurlock, a 22-year-old black man, was killed Saturday after authorities said he tussled with the owner of two downtown bars. Surveillance video of the strip of bars shows a group of people, including Scurlock, approach white bar owner Jake Gardner. Two people shove Gardner to the ground, and he fired shots in the air. Seconds later, Scurlock is seen jumping on Gardner, who then fires the gun over his shoulder, striking Scurlock. Authorities have declined to press charges in the death, calling the shooting self-defense. But Gardner could still face misdemeanor gun charges because his concealed carry permit for the gun had expired, the police chief said. ___ DETROIT A 21-year-old man was killed in downtown Detroit after someone fired shots into a vehicle during a protest. According to a police report, the man was sitting in the driver’s seat of a car in a parking lot with two others when someone opened fire and then ran away. ___ SUBURBAN CHICAGO Two people were killed during unrest Monday in the suburb of Cicero, according to a town official. Spokesman Ray Hanania did not provide details about those who were killed but said it happened during protests. ___ Associated Press journalists Herbert McCann contributed from Chicago and Ryan J.

1623187077,2020-06-02 08:00:00,Huebner: My view of Fargo's peaceful protest and later riot,https://www.inforum.com/news/6517771-Huebner-My-view-of-Fargos-peaceful-protest-and-later-riot,en,False,"computers and the internet, police, news and news media, demonstrations and riots",98987,inforum.com,http://www.inforum.com/#spider,"FARGO — People here watched in disbelief as a day of peaceful, unifying protest devolved into a night of rioting and destruction. An estimated 2,000 people turned out Saturday, May 30, to march in solidarity with others nationwide protesting the killing five days prior of a black man, George Floyd, by a white Minneapolis police officer. The Forum and WDAY-TV covered the day’s events, and as it became clear in early evening that tensions were rising, they mobilized even more to show the community what was happening. Related: listen live watch live Reporters, photographers and other staff streamed in to document it all with online updates, live broadcasts and Facebook livestreams. Not scheduled to work, I was almost finished with a long overdue hair appointment when I began hearing some people in the crowds downtown were no longer peaceful. Fargo police tweeted that some were throwing water bottles at officers. Protesters jumped on the hood of a squad car with an officer inside, breaking the windshield. Heading downtown, my intention was to stick around just for a bit, but the move turned into an hourslong view of something I’ve never seen firsthand in my 35 years as a journalist. Sometime after 7 p.m. Saturday, I parked my car along First Avenue North near Roberts Street and walked to the intersection, which was blocked by law enforcement. I tried to take stock of the crowd — a mix of people in their 20s and 30s, some older, some very vocal and engaged, many recording on their phones, and others standing by, just observing. One vehicle came through, its occupants cheering and applauding for law enforcement, as did another, squealing through the intersection with people on the roof, shouting profanity. At 7:25 p.m., I saw and heard a commotion at the northeast corner of the Quentin N. Burdick U.S. Courthouse and went to shoot cellphone video. It’s unclear what happened, but I caught the tail end of what seemed to be an altercation among protesters. I started doing a Facebook live, and not long after, one person in the crowd threw a rock about the size of a softball that struck a man squarely in the face. Another person lobbed it back, the rock covered with blood. This happened just northwest of the main group of protesters, which had settled in on First Avenue in front of Wurst Bier Hall. Around 7:50 p.m., officers at the intersection announced on a loudspeaker that protesters needed to disperse before tear gas would be deployed in about ten minutes. To my recollection, it was more like 20 minutes before that happened. I had moved away from there, not wanting any part of that, and circled around the main protest site to make my way to The Forum. Upon arriving there, I started another Facebook live from the second floor newsroom, describing what was happening. At some point, law enforcement formed a line along Broadway, across First Avenue, staying there for quite some time before moving slowly to the east. Between the police line and The Forum, businesses were being vandalized and ransacked. WDAY reporters Matt Henson and Andreas Haffar were right in the thick of it, but both said they were never really in fear for their safety. “When you’re in it, the adrenaline is going — you’re doing your job,” Haffar said. Protesters rolled large garbage bins into the street for shelter and set something on fire in the middle of the street. Henson said protesters tried to use him and his photographer as human shields, so the two of them relocated. At one point, protesters launched bottle rockets at police. “They were flying over our heads while we were on live TV,” Henson said. His biggest concern was the highly visible station vehicle, wrapped in the WDAY logo and parked outside the Hotel Donaldson. The car was not damaged, he said. Haffar said multiple people approached him to point out that the evening rioters were not part of the earlier march. Forum reporter C.S. Hagen covered the peaceful protest and was also in the crowd that evening. “It felt more like a mob,” Hagen said of the nighttime event, noting that he was impressed with the “joyful” mood earlier in the day, when Fargo Mayor Tim Mahoney and Moorhead Mayor Johnathan Judd jumped into the crowd and hugged people. Both Hagen and Henson made note of the restraint exercised by law enforcement in the face of rocks, bricks, water bottles and chairs being thrown at them. Police used pepper spray early to disperse the crowd, along with pepper balls and nonlethal sponge rounds later against the most violent rioters, they said. Hagen said he did not see officers engage otherwise with protesters. I had the same impression from my vantage point at The Forum — that law enforcement appeared to act in a calm, methodical manner. I tried to describe what I was seeing as objectively as I could. Protesters who held a peaceful march earlier in the day have legitimate, long-justified concerns, laid bare by the murder of George Floyd. Some went home and weren’t part of the evening crowd, while others who stayed tried, in vain, to prevent others from acting in ways aimed at hijacking the cause. Who knows, exactly, what was on the minds of those who perpetrated the violence? I can’t pretend to know. I’m sure people could hear me sighing with sadness during the livestream. I struggled with keeping my phone charged, and the livestream was interrupted multiple times when my kids called to see if I was okay. I admit to feeling a little panicky at one point, thinking I should just go home. The next day, I received multiple messages from people thanking me for the reporting. One person, concerned about a loved one in the law enforcement line, was grateful to be able to see what was happening. I feel fortunate to have been able to give people a view of something that will surely be seared in our memories and in the history of our city for a long time to come. My hope is that we keep open minds and open hearts to somehow come out of this better.",0.0

Deputies swayed armed civilians from entering Fargo riot zone About the time authorities began firing pepperballs and using tear gas to disperse unruly crowds in downtown Fargo Saturday evening, May 30, a small group of armed civilians was making its way to the scene intent on rendering assistance. Before the group could reach the hot zone, a pair of Cass County sheriff's deputies intercepted them and let them know it might be best if they just went home. And that's what they did, said Cass County Sheriff Jesse Jahner. A posting on the Fargo Police Department's Facebook page Saturday night said dispatchers received a call about 8:25 p.m. regarding men carrying assault rifles.

The next morning, I opened my print edition of The Forum and was dismayed to see the front page photo was that of the riot and unrest instead of the march. Since that night, local media outlets have been fixated on the riots. Our nonviolent efforts from earlier in the day have practically been discounted because the local media keeps feeding us the content with the most violence and vitriol.

Where are the stories about people who showed up despite the coronavirus pandemic? In the news cycle, “if it bleeds, it leads.” But fixating on Fargo’s riot gives us an excuse to ignore the conversations we set out to encourage during our march for social justice.

(AP Photo/Matt Rourke) “He thinks division helps him,” the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee said in a speech at Philadelphia’s City Hall. “This narcissism has become more important than the nation’s well-being.” Biden seized on police driving back peaceful protesters near the White House on Monday so Trump could briefly pose with a Bible in front of nearby St. John’s Church. “If he opened it instead of brandishing it, he could have learned something,"" Biden said as he chided authorities for using “tear gas and flash grenades in order to stage a photo op."" Biden said Trump ""might also want to open the U.S. Constitution. If he did, he’d find the First Amendment. It protects the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.” Trump senior advisor Kellyanne Conway denied that the president directed authorities' actions to move back the protesters and bristled at suggestions the church visit was merely a photo op. She countered that Biden and other critics had no basis to second-guess what was in the president's heart and his intentions. Still, Biden’s address marked a new phase of a presidential campaign that had been effectively frozen for more than two months by the spread of the coronavirus. The former vice president is now emerging from his Delaware home to confront Trump and using in-person appearances to offer direct competition with the president, rather than relying on virtual events that often failed to garner a lot of attention. It was the third consecutive day that Biden made a public appearance and the first time he's been out of the state since March. His remarks were carried live on the three major cable news networks. Biden spoke as upheaval in the wake of George Floyd’s death has spread around the country. While Biden spoke, the National Guard maintained a visible presence to defend public buildings as Philadelphia continues to face sustained violent protests. Several buildings adjacent to City Hall, including banks, convenience stores and hotels, were boarded up. He spoke of the “tug of war between the American ideal that we are all created equal and the harsh reality that racism has long torn us apart.” “The honest truth is both elements are part of the American character,"" he said. Since the early days of his candidacy, Biden has framed the election as a “battle for the soul of the nation.” He went into greater detail on Tuesday about what that meant and the questions voters should ask themselves. “I ask every American to look at where we are now and think anew: Is this who we are?” he said. “Is this who we want to be? Is this what we pass on to our kids’ and grandkids’ lives? Fear and finger-pointing rather than hope and the pursuit of happiness? Incompetence and anxiety? Self-absorption and selfishness?” The tone was part of Biden's effort to cast himself as a “consoler in chief"" in stark contrast to Trump's blunt, confrontational style. While he noted that his anguish over the death of his son Beau five years ago from cancer isn't the same as the sadness felt by those protesting police brutality, he said he understood the hopelessness that can come with grief. “Like many of you, I know what it’s like to grieve,” Biden said. “I know what it feels like when you’re thinking you can’t go on.” He said “bad cops should be dealt with severely and swiftly” and offered examples of how he might ease racial tensions and govern. The former vice president called on Congress to act now on legislation that would place a federal ban on police using chokeholds. Biden also promised that, if elected, he would increase access to health care and improve the pay of first-responders and other workers who have stayed on jobs deemed essential during the pandemic. But Biden's speech was perhaps most notable for its ferocity, even though his criticism of Trump is common. He accused the president of being more worried about himself than the nation at a time when it “is crying out for leadership.” “This president today is part of the problem and accelerates it,” Biden said, adding that Trump is “consumed with his blinding ego.” Biden offered a stark departure from Trump, who tweeted Tuesday that Washington “had no problems last night” and cited “many arrests,” as well as “overwhelming force” and “Domination,” for which he thanked himself. Trump has embraced the language of confrontation and war, seeking to be a “president of law and order,"" and betting that voters will want a more forceful approach at a time of national tumult and racial unrest. Katrina Pierson, a senior adviser to the president's reelection campaign, said Biden's speech “obviously made the crass political calculation that unrest in America is a benefit to his candidacy.” “President Trump is restoring the nation to order and is clearly the leader we need to return the country to peace and prosperity,” Pierson said in a statement. Despite his more confrontational approach, Biden was direct about the limits of his ability to singularly reconcile the nation's differences. He was careful to note that his administration won't be able to fix everything, especially not all at once. “I know that the presidency, that's a very big job,"" he said. “Nobody will get it right every time, and I won't either."" But he vowed not to “traffic in fear and division."" “I won't fan the flames of hate,” Biden said. ""I'll seek to heal the racial wounds that have long plagued our country, not use them for political gain.” ___ Weissert reported from Washington. ___ Catch up on the 2020 election campaign with AP experts on our weekly politics podcast, “Ground Game.” Copyright 2020 Associated Press.

Protesters gather in Sydney, Tuesday, June 2, 2020, to support the cause of U.S. protests over the death of George Floyd and urged their own governments to address racism and police violence. Floyd died last week after he was pinned to the pavement by a white police officer who put his knee on the handcuffed black man's neck until he stopped breathing. (AP Photo/Rick Rycroft) French protesters took a knee and raised their fists while firefighters struggled to extinguish multiple blazes as a largely peaceful, multiracial demonstration degenerated into scattered tensions. Police said at least 20,000 people joined the demonstration, defying a virus-related ban on protests to pay homage to Floyd and Adama Traore, a French black man who died in police custody. Electric scooters and construction barriers went up in flames, and smoke stained a sign reading ""Restaurant Open"" — on the first day French cafes were allowed to open after nearly three months of virus lockdown. Chanting ""I can't breathe,"" thousands marched peacefully through Australia's largest city, while thousands more demonstrated in the Dutch capital of The Hague and hundreds rallied in Tel Aviv. Expressions of anger erupted in multiple languages on social networks, with thousands of Swedes joining an online protest and others speaking out under the banner of #BlackOutTuesday. Diplomatic ire percolated too, with the European Union's top foreign policy official saying the bloc was ""shocked and appalled"" by Floyd's death. Floyd died last week after a police officer pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes even after he stopped moving and pleading for air. The death set off protests that spread across America — and now, beyond. As demonstrations escalated worldwide, solidarity with U.S. protesters increasingly mixed with local worries. ""This happened in the United States, but it happens in France, it happens everywhere,"" Paris protester Xavier Dintimille said. While he said police violence seems worse in the U.S., he added, ""all blacks live this to a degree."" Fears of the coronavirus remain close to the surface and were the reason cited for banning Tuesday's protest at the main Paris courthouse, because gatherings of more than 10 people remain forbidden. But demonstrators showed up anyway. Some said police violence worsened during virus confinement in working class suburbs with large minority populations, deepening a feeling of injustice. As the Paris demonstration wound down, police fired volley after volley of tear gas and protesters threw debris. Police were less visible than usual at the city's frequent protests. Tensions also erupted at a related protest in the southern city of Marseille. The demonstrations were held in honor of Traore, who died shortly after his arrest in 2016, and in solidarity with Americans demonstrating against Floyd's death. The Traore case has become emblematic of the fight against police brutality in France. The circumstances of the death of the 24-year-old Frenchman of Malian origin are still under investigation after four years of conflicting medical reports about what happened. The lawyer for two of the three police officers involved in the arrest, Rodolphe Bosselut, said the Floyd and Traore cases ""have strictly nothing to do with each other."" Bosselut told The Associated Press that Traore's death wasn't linked with the conditions of his arrest but other factors, including a preexisting medical condition. Traore's family says he died from asphyxiation because of police tactics — and that his last words were ""I can't breathe."" ""I can't breathe"" were also the final words of David Dungay, a 26-year-old Aboriginal man who died in a Sydney prison in 2015 while being restrained by five guards. As 3,000 people marched peacefully through Sydney, many said they had been inspired by a mixture of sympathy for African Americans and to call for change in Australia's treatment of its indigenous population, particularly involving police. The mostly Australian crowd at the authorized demonstration also included protesters from the U.S. and elsewhere. ""I'm here for my people, and for our fallen brothers and sisters around the world,"" said Sydney indigenous woman Amanda Hill, 46, who attended the rally with her daughter and two nieces. ""What's happening in America shines a light on the situation here."" Even as U.S. President Donald Trump fanned anger by threatening to send in troops on American protesters, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau refrained from directly criticizing him and said the protests should force awareness of racism everywhere. ""We all watch in horror and consternation what's going on in the United States,"" he said after pausing 21 seconds before answering. ""But it is a time for us as Canadians to recognize that we, too, have our challenges, that black Canadians and racialized Canadians face discrimination as a lived reality every single day. There is systemic discrimination in Canada."" More protests in various countries are planned later in the week, including a string of demonstrations in front of U.S. embassies on Saturday. The drama unfolding in the U.S. drew increasing diplomatic concern. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell's remarks in Brussels were the strongest to come out of the 27-nation bloc, saying Floyd's death was a result of an abuse of power. Borrell told reporters that ""like the people of the United States, we are shocked and appalled by the death of George Floyd."" He underlined that Europeans ""support the right to peaceful protest, and also we condemn violence and racism of any kind, and for sure, we call for a de-escalation of tensions."" German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said peaceful protests in the U.S. following Floyd's death are ""understandable and more than legitimate."" ""I can only express my hope that the peaceful protests do not continue to lead to violence, but even more express the hope that these protests have an effect in the United States,"" Maas said. More African leaders are speaking up over the killing of Floyd. ""It cannot be right that, in the 21st century, the United States, this great bastion of democracy, continues to grapple with the problem of systemic racism,"" Ghana President Nana Akufo-Addo said in a statement, adding that black people the world over are shocked and distraught. Kenyan opposition leader and former Prime Minister Raila Odinga offered a prayer for the U.S., ""that there be justice and freedom for all human beings who call America their country."" Like some in Africa who have spoken out, Odinga also noted troubles at home, saying the judging of people by character instead of skin color ""is a dream we in Africa, too, owe our citizens."" ___ Associated Press writers Rick Rycroft in Sydney, Rod McGuirk in Canberra, Australia, Lori Hinnant in Paris, Aritz Parra in Madrid, Frank Jordans in Berlin, Lorne Cook in Brussels, Peter Dejong in The Hague contributed. ___ Follow AP’s latest news about the protests at https://apnews.com/GeorgeFloyd Copyright 2020 Associated Press.

The Winnipeg Jets’ captain has been getting out on the rink a little, in early preparation for a playoff meeting with the Calgary Flames, if and when the NHL returns to play. But his mind has been on his home state recently, and on the state of society in his home country, for good reason. In the aftermath of the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis, and the resulting violence and unrest in the Twin Cities, Wheeler took to social media on Saturday, May 30, and spoke out via Twitter: I needed to say something in my own words. pic.twitter.com/VpkidaMjbX — Blake Wheeler (@BiggieFunke) May 31, 2020 Three days later, in a Zoom call with reporters, the former Minnesota Gophers star reiterated the need for peace in the nation, and overall societal change. He embraced the unique ability of pro athletes like him to spread that message. listen live watch live “We have to be as involved in this as black athletes. It can’t just be their fight,” said Wheeler, 33, who has been a regular in the NHL for the past dozen seasons. He noted the lack of widespread support for Colin Kaepernick and other black athletes who have protested peacefully in the past. “I want to be real clear here. I look in the mirror before I look out at everyone else. I wish I was more involved sooner than I was. I wish it didn’t take me this long to get behind it in a meaningful way. But I guess what you can do is try to be better going forward.” As the father of three young children, Wheeler spoke about watching the video of Floyd’s arrest and death with a 7-year-old son, who repeatedly asked Wheeler, “Why won’t (the police) get off his neck?” Wheeler also recalled a youth hockey team of his own while growing up in the western suburbs of the Twin Cities, and crying after a black teammate was attacked with a racial slur in the handshake line. Having been NHL teammates with black players like Evander Kane and Dustin Byfuglien, Wheeler said that jersey color should be the only hue that is noticed. “The teams I’ve been on, that hasn’t been a thing. We respect what you do as a player. We respect what you are as an individual,” Wheeler said. “That doesn’t matter in sports. Color doesn’t matter at all. It’s about what you bring to the team and how you perform, especially when you get on the ice. It’s all about the game.” Wheeler said he remains hopeful about the future, and has been in regular contact with his family back in Minnesota. He was most struck by a recent text from his father, who grew up in Detroit during the tumultuous 1960s. In 1967, riots broke out due to race relations and significant parts of that city burned. “He was telling me ... about the race riots in Detroit in the late ‘60s and he just said, ‘My generation didn’t get it right, and hopefully yours does,’” Wheeler said. “I’m hopeful my generation and my kids’ generation fix this, and get this country so that there’s brighter days ahead.”",0.0

Good for him. Like his head coach and some of his teammates, the North Dakota State quarterback spoke up. He participated in the peaceful march Saturday, May 30, in Fargo to protest the police brutality that killed George Floyd in Minneapolis. He posted pictures of it on his Twitter account. This is important. listen live watch live Lance is a rock star in Fargo-Moorhead and the region. He was the undisputed star player on the Bison football team that went 16-0 and won a national championship last season, despite being a first-year starter as a redshirt freshman. In the past few months, Lance's profile has exploded nationally as NFL draft analysts pegged him as a potential first-round draft choice next year. He stands to be the Bison football player with the brightest spotlight shown on him in program history. He will be on a stage like no other player in Fargo ever was, Carson Wentz included. He will be the most popular, and scrutinized, Bison player ever. And he's chosen to take that popularity for a walk, quite literally. Lance is showing he's more than just a leader on the football field. He's a leader, period. Athletes walk a fine line in these politically divided times. Just ask Colin Kaepernick. His peaceful protest against police brutality a few years ago, taking a knee during the national anthem before an NFL game, ended his career and made him an enemy of the political right. Fans, and some media, want athletes to stick to the script, to speak and act in the expected cliches. There is little incentive for athletes, particularly black athletes, to speak up. Other than the most important incentive: Standing up for what is right and just. Lance did that, while representing a university in a state that is overwhelmingly white and conservative. A large percentage of Bison fans, perhaps even strong majority, are supporters of President Donald Trump and unlikely to be sympathetic to the protesters. But they are also unlikely to push back against Lance, because they know him and they love him. His actions might even spur some to look at the protests and the reasons for them differently. If Trey Lance is willing to march, they might think, maybe the protesters have some merit. And the impression Lance could have on young fans? Incalculable. Lance wasn't the only one to participate. Teammates Phoenix Sproles and Tony Pierce also marched. Bison head coach Matt Entz, and other coaches in football and other sports, posted support on social media. But Lance is the most popular, with the biggest platform to affect change. Whether the 19-year-old quarterback thought of any of these things is not known. He declined an interview through an NDSU athletic department spokesman. There is obviously more to Lance, though, than football. There appears to be a social awareness that belies his youth, and it likely started at home in Marshall, Minn. Lance's mother, Angie, made a passionate and poignant Facebook post in the wake of Floyd's death in late May. She approached it from the perspective of the mother who has two black sons, Trey and his younger brother Bryce. Her words were as powerful as any written on the subject. ""It’s my motherly instinct to help them feel safe and I want to tell them as long as they are good people and make good choices, they will be okay,"" Angie wrote. ""I can’t tell them that – we have to tell them again, that they can die for being black. And, I, like millions of moms, will continue to go to bed every single night with the fear that one of them may be pulled over by the wrong police officer."" ""We are blessed with amazing people in our lives who are law enforcement officers, first responders, etc. We need them but this is not about those people, is it?"" she continued. ""We know who this is about. Do you care? Will you make excuses for why the police responded this way? Will you talk to your children – or will you use your privilege to be quiet? Will you use your privilege to ignore this and simply choose not to even mention it? I will not be quiet, I cannot ignore it and go about my evening. Please be courageous – be brave. Please do NOT ignore this. It might cost you something – maybe a friend or your reputation? Look in the mirror."" Her son is living her words. He's chosen, with some risk, to not ignore what happened. To stand up and be counted beyond the football field. Thankfully, Trey Lance isn't sticking to sports.",0.0

WASHINGTON — American cities erupted in violence and destruction in a seventh straight night of unrest, with several police officers shot or run over, amid boasts and threats from President Donald Trump to send in troops to ""dominate the streets."" In New York, nonviolent protests Monday night were punctuated by people smashing shop windows near Rockefeller Center and breaching the doors of Macy's flagship store on 34th Street, littering the pavement with broken glass. An SUV plowed into a group of officers at a demonstration in Buffalo, injuring three, including a state trooper who suffered a broken leg and a shattered pelvis. Demonstrations also broke out in such places as Philadelphia, where hundreds of protesters spilled onto a highway in the heart of the city; Atlanta, where police fired tear gas at demonstrators; and Nashville, where more than 60 National Guard members put down their riot shields at the request of peaceful protesters who had gathered in front of Tennessee's Capitol to honor George Floyd. Bystander Sean Jones, who watched as people ransacked luxury stores in New York over the weekend, said: ""People are doing this so next time, before they think about trying to kill another black person, they're going to be like, 'Damn, we don't want them out here doing this ... again.'"" The unrest in Minneapolis appeared to stabilize on the same day Floyd's brother made an impassioned plea for peace at the spot where a white police officer, Derek Chauvin, put his knee on the handcuffed black man's neck until he stopped breathing last week. Chauvin has been charged with murder. Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said Tuesday that prosecutors were working as fast as they can to determine if the three other officers at the scene should be charged, too. All four have been fired. The death toll from the unrest rose to at least nine, including two people killed in a Chicago suburb. More than 5,600 people nationwide have been arrested over the past week for such offenses as stealing, blocking highways and breaking curfew, according to a count by The Associated Press. Cities struggled to keep police in line and avoid instances of excessive force. The police chief in Louisville, Kentucky, was fired after a beloved restaurant owner was killed by police and National Guard members enforcing a curfew. In Richmond, Virginia, the police chief said officers who used tear gas on a group of peaceful protesters would be disciplined. An officer was shot shortly before midnight near the Circus Circus casino in Las Vegas. Police had no immediate word on the officer's condition. Four officers were shot in St. Louis; they were expected to recover. Trump, meanwhile, portrayed himself as a hard-nosed, law-and-order president, with police under federal command using tear gas to clear peaceful demonstrators from a park near the White House so that he could walk to a church and pose with a Bible. Emerging after two days out of public view, he threatened from the White House Rose Garden to deploy ""thousands and thousands"" of U.S. troops. The photo op at the house of worship known as the Church of the Presidents was condemned by Episcopal Bishop Mariann Edgar Budde. ""The president just used a Bible and one of the churches of my diocese as a backdrop for a message antithetical to the teachings of Jesus and everything that our church stands for,"" she said. A senior White House official said Tuesday that despite Trump's threats, the goal was to pressure governors to deploy National Guard units. The president was not rushing to use the Insurrection Act to send in the military, according to the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. For nearly a week since Floyd's death, largely peaceful protests by day have turned to chaos at night. ""We have been sitting on a powder keg for some time and it has burst,"" Philadelphia Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw said. Trump warned that if governors don't deploy the National Guard in sufficient numbers to ""dominate the streets,"" the U.S. military will step in to ""quickly solve the problem for them."" ""We have the greatest country in the world,"" the president declared. ""We're going to keep it safe."" As Trump spoke, tear gas canisters could be heard exploding. A military deployment by Trump to U.S. states would mark a stunning federal intervention rarely seen in modern American history. It drew comparisons to 1968, when Richard Nixon ran as the law-and-order candidate in the aftermath of riots following the assassination of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. Trump made little effort to address the grievances of black Americans and others outraged by Floyd's death and the scourge of police brutality, undermining what his reelection campaign had hoped would be increased appeal to African American voters. Federal law allows presidents to dispatch the military into states to suppress an insurrection or if a state is defying federal law, legal experts said. But officials in New York and other states asserted that the president does not have a unilateral right to send in troops against the will of local governments.",0.0

Energy companies also rose as the price of crude oil headed higher. Bond yields were mostly higher, another sign of ebbing pessimism among investors. The modest gains have the S&P 500 on track for a three-day winning streak, extending the benchmark index's remarkable two-month rally off a steep skid in February and March as broad swaths of the U.S. economy ground to a halt due to the coronavirus pandemic. So far, Wall Street's momentum has not been derailed by the wave of daily unrest across the U.S. that began last week in Minneapolis as a protest over police brutality. Cities across the country have been rocked by violence and destruction for seven days in a row, spurring threats from the White House to send troops in to put down the unrest. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 189 points, or 0.7%, to 25,668. The Nasdaq composite was up 0.2%. Smaller company stocks had some of the biggest gains in the early going.

Other symbols came down elsewhere, leaving an empty pedestal and a bare flagpole. BIRMINGHAM, Ala. — The base of a massive Confederate monument in Alabama's largest city was all that remained Tuesday after crews dismantled the towering obelisk and trucked it away in pieces. Other symbols came down elsewhere, leaving an empty pedestal and a bare flagpole. Workers hired by the city of Birmingham began removing the top portion of the 115-year-old monument from Linn Park late Monday. By daybreak, the pedestal was the only thing left, covered with graffiti and pock marks from protests against police brutality. Sarah Collins Rudolph, whose sister Addie Mae Collins died in a racist church bombing that killed three other black girls in the city in 1963, came to see the remains. She lowered a protective face mask to take in the sight. ""I'm glad it's been removed because it has been so long. It's a hate monument,"" said Rudolph. She was seriously injured in the blast at 16th Street Baptist Church, and testified against Ku Klux Klansmen who were convicted in the killings. Confederate symbols across the South have been targeted for vandalism during demonstrations sparked by the death in police custody of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Now even some of their longtime defenders have decided to remove them. In Alexandria, Virginia, it was the United Daughters of the Confederacy that took action early Tuesday, removing the statue of a soldier gazing south from Old Town since 1889. And outside Tampa, Florida, a Sons of Confederate Veterans chapter lowered a huge Confederate battle flag that has long been flown in view of two interstate highways. Birmingham finally took action about a day after protesters tried to remove the monument themselves, during one of the many nationwide protests sparked by the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody. Live video from overnight showed a flatbed truck hauling off the stone pieces in the early morning hours. It's unclear where they were being taken. Crews were expected to return later Tuesday to finish the job, a city official said. The monument had been the subject of a protracted court battle between the city and state. Alabama authorities said Birmingham would face a $25,000 assessment for violating a state law that bans the removal of such monuments. Mayor Randall Woodfin said the fine would be much more affordable than the cost of continued unrest in the city. Work to remove the monument began on Monday, which happened to be Alabama's holiday honoring Confederate President Jefferson Davis, who was sworn in on the steps of the state Capitol in Montgomery. There, on the same day, someone knocked over a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee outside a mostly black high school named for him, news outlets reported. In Alexandria, a city spokesman said the United Daughters of the Confederacy informed the city on Monday that it would remove the statue, and the city's only role was to provide traffic support. By morning, the pedestal was all that was left. City officials were not told where the statue was taken. Titled ""Appomattox,"" it depicts a solitary Confederate soldier, his head bowed slightly. In 1890, a state law was passed barring local officials from ever removing it. That law was repealed earlier this year. Alexandria Mayor Justin Wilson tweeted photos of the removal on Tuesday, saying ""Alexandria, like all great cities, is constantly changing and evolving.""",0.0

Trump and First Lady Melania Trump traveled across town Tuesday for a brief visit to Saint John Paul II National Shrine adjacent to The Catholic University of America. The shrine is a place of prayer for Catholics but welcomes people of all faiths. The Trumps posed for photos in front of a statue of Saint Pope John Paul II outside the shrine and stood silently for a few minutes, hands clasped in front of them. They did not make remarks. Washington Archbishop Wilton D. Gregory slammed the presidential visit in a statement shortly before the Trumps' arrival. “I find it baffling that and reprehensible that any Catholic facility would allow itself to be so egregiously misused and manipulated in a fashion that violates our religious principles, which call us to defend the rights of all people even those with whom we might disagree,” Gregory said in a statement. Trump also is scheduled to sign an executive order on international religious freedom on Tuesday. Trump's visit to the shrine comes just one day after he walked across Lafayette Park next to the White House and posed for cameras outside St. John's Episcopal Church, which suffered slight damage after it was set on fire by protesters late Sunday night. Violent protests have erupted in Washington and dozens of other cities across the country following the death of George Floyd, a black man in Minneapolis who died in the custody of police. Former police officer Derrick Chauvin has been charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter in Floyd's death. Critics hammered Trump because police used tear gas and shields on protesters in Lafayette Park, essentially clearing a path for the president to walk to the historic building known as the church of presidents. The show of force came roughly half an hour before a 7 p.m. curfew was to take effect in Washington. ""Tear-gassing peaceful protesters without provocation just so that the President could pose for photos outside a church dishonors every value that faith teaches us,"" said a joint statement from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, said in a speech Tuesday in Philadelphia that the St. John's event proves Trump is ""more interested in serving the passions of his base."" ""When peaceful protesters are dispersed by the order of the president from the doorstep of the people’s house, the White House – using tear gas and flash grenades – in order to stage a photo op at a noble church, we can be forgiven for believing that the president is more interested in power than in principle,"" Biden said. Church officials protested that Trump did not call them about his plans to visit to St. John's on Monday. Mariann E. Budde, bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Washington, which includes St. John’s Episcopal Church, told CNN she was outraged by the use of tear gas to get people out of the way for a photo op. ""The president just used a Bible, the most sacred text of the Judeo-Christian tradition, and one of the churches of my diocese, without permission, as a backdrop for a message antithetical to the teachings of Jesus and everything that our churches stand for,"" she said. Bishop Gregory noted that Saint Pope John Paul II was “an ardent defender of the rights and dignity of human beings"" and ""certainly would not condone the use of tear gas and other deterrents to silence, scatter or intimidate them for a photo opportunity in front of a place of worship and peace."" White House officials said Trump did want to pay his respects to St. John's, which suffered a basement fire during protests Sunday. The president also wanted to leave the White House grounds to prove he was not “in the bunker“ because of the protesters, said one official who requested anonymity to discuss the president’s communications strategy. The president was particularly angry when word got out that the Secret Service escorted him to the bunker of the White House during protests just beyond the gates of the executive mansion on Friday, the official said. After the St. John's visit, the White House put out a statement saying protesters had been repeatedly warned to exit the park ahead of the 7 p.m. curfew. “The perimeter was expanded to help enforce the 7 p.m.curfew in the same area where rioters attempted to burn down one of our nation’s most historic churches the night before,"" spokesman Judd Deere. ""Protesters were given three warnings by the U.S. Park Police."" In a morning tweet less than two hours before his visit to the shrine,Trump took credit for crackdowns in Washington – and Minneapolis. ""D.C. had no problems last night,"" he said. ""Many arrests. Great job done by all. Overwhelming force. Domination. Likewise, Minneapolis was great (thank you President Trump!)."" A couple hundred peaceful protesters gathered down the street from the national shrine ahead of Trump’s arrival, holding up signs and chanting ""no justice, no peace"" and ""black lives matter."" Police on the scene wore baseball caps and vests, but not riot gear. As Trump's motorcade arrived, some protesters shouted expletives, and others raised their middle finger. Kathy Warner, a 77-year-old retired teacher, said she was there to honor Floyd’s memory and to protest the president. She held a sign that read ""in solidarity – RIP George Floyd – Black Lives Matter.” Warner said she hoped passing drivers would read the message and “think about the injustice done to African Americans for centuries.” Warner said she has a 49-year-old son and that her heart “hurts for moms whose sons can’t reach that age.” She called Trump’s visit to St. John’s on Monday “obscene” for the way he “poses with the Bible.” Some drivers honked in support as they passed by and shook their fists out their car windows. The shrine to the late Pope John Paul II sits on the site of the former John Paul II Cultural Center, which the Knights of Columbus bought in 2011. The lay Catholic organization established it as a shrine to John Paul and added a permanent museum exhibit about his life. Daily masses are held at the shrine, which is a destination for Catholic pilgrims. The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops declared it a national shrine on March 14, 2014, after John Paul was canonized as a saint. ""It is meant to be a place of genuine encounter with God that leads to a renewal of individuals, families, societies, and cultures,"" reads the shrine's official website, adding it is a place where God ""heals and renews every dimension of human life.""

PARIS — Thousands of French protesters defied a virus-related police ban and rallied Tuesday against racial injustice and heavy-handed police tactics, as global outrage over what happened to George Floyd in the United States kindled frustrations across borders and continents. Clapping, cheering and waving signs reading ""Black Lives Matter"" and ""Police Everywhere, Justice Nowhere,"" the largely young, multiracial crowd streamed to the main Paris courthouse and rallied peacefully while police monitored closely from nearby corners. Earlier, thousands marched in Sydney, Australia's largest city, chanting ""I can't breathe,"" and expressions of anger erupted in multiple languages on social networks, with thousands of Swedes joining an online protest and others speaking out under the banner of #BlackOutTuesday. Diplomatic ire percolated too, with the European Union's top foreign policy official saying the bloc was ""shocked and appalled"" by Floyd's death. As protests escalated worldwide, solidarity with U.S. demonstrators increasingly mixed with local worries. ""When you refuse to treat the problem of racism ... it leads to what we see in the United States,"" said Dominique Sopo, head of French activist group SOS Racisme. ""The case of George Floyd echoes what we fear in France."" Floyd died last week after a police officer pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes even after he stopped moving and pleading for air. The death set off protests that spread across America -- and now, beyond. Fears of the coronavirus remain close to the surface and were the reason cited by the police for banning Tuesday's protest at the main Paris courthouse. Gatherings of more than 10 people remain banned in France as part of virus confinement measures. But the Paris protest plans drew attention online, and demonstrators showed up anyway. Similar demonstrations were held in other French cities in honor of Adama Traore, who died shortly after his arrest in 2016, and in solidarity with Americans demonstrating against Floyd's death. The Traore case has become emblematic of the fight against police brutality in France. The circumstances of the death of the 24-year-old Frenchman of Malian origin are still under investigation after four years of conflicting medical reports about what happened. The lawyer for two of the three police officers involved in the arrest, Rodolphe Bosselut, said the Floyd and Traore cases ""have strictly nothing to do with each other."" Bosselut told The Associated Press that Traore's death wasn't linked with the conditions of his arrest but other factors, including a pre-existing medical condition. Traore's family says he died from asphyxiation because of police tactics -- and that his last words were ""I can't breathe."" ""I can't breathe"" were also the final words of David Dungay, a 26-year-old Aboriginal man who died in a Sydney prison in 2015 while being restrained by five guards. As 3,000 people marched peacefully through Sydney, many said they had been inspired by a mixture of sympathy for African Americans amid ongoing violent protests in the U.S. and to call for change in Australia's treatment of its indigenous population, particularly involving police. The mostly Australian crowd at the authorized demonstration also included protesters from the U.S. and elsewhere. ""I'm here for my people, and for our fallen brothers and sisters around the world,"" said Sydney indigenous woman Amanda Hill, 46, who attended the rally with her daughter and two nieces. ""What's happening in America shines a light on the situation here. It doesn't matter if it's about the treatment of black men and women from here or from another country; enough is enough,"" she said. A total of 432 indigenous Australians have died in police detention since a 1991 Royal Commission — Australia's highest level of official inquiry — into Aboriginal deaths in custody, according to The Guardian newspaper. Australia has also never signed a treaty with the country's indigenous population, who suffer higher-than-average rates of infant mortality and poor health, plus shorter life expectancy and lower levels of education and employment than white Australians. Another protest was planned Tuesday in the Dutch capital The Hague, and more than 6,000 people attended a Sweden-organized online protest to express support with the Black Lives Matter movement. Among speakers was Aysha Jones, a Gambia-born and Sweden-based activist and fashion blogger. Jones said the protest was important to show support to people in America, but also to remind Swedes that racism ""does exist here, it's very real and people are being harmed from it."" More protests in various countries are planned later in the week, including a string of demonstrations in front of U.S. embassies on Saturday. The drama unfolding in the U.S. drew increasing diplomatic concern. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell's remarks in Brussels were the strongest to come out of the 27-nation bloc, saying Floyd's death was a result of an abuse of power. Borrell told reporters that ""like the people of the United States, we are shocked and appalled by the death of George Floyd."" He underlined that Europeans ""support the right to peaceful protest, and also we condemn violence and racism of any kind, and for sure, we call for a de-escalation of tensions."" German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said peaceful protests in the U.S. following Floyd's death are ""understandable and more than legitimate."" ""I can only express my hope that the peaceful protests do not continue to lead to violence, but even more express the hope that these protests have an effect in the United States,"" Maas said. More African leaders are speaking up over the killing of Floyd. ""It cannot be right that, in the 21st century, the United States, this great bastion of democracy, continues to grapple with the problem of systemic racism,"" Ghana President Nana Akufo-Addo said in a statement, adding that black people the world over are shocked and distraught. Kenyan opposition leader and former Prime Minister Raila Odinga offered a prayer for the U.S., ""that there be justice and freedom for all human beings who call America their country."" Like some in Africa who have spoken out, Odinga also noted troubles at home, saying the judging of people by character instead of skin color ""is a dream we in Africa, too, owe our citizens.""",0.0

Polls began to close Tuesday night as voters navigated curfews and health concerns in a slate of primary contests that tested the nation's ability to host elections amid dueling crises and moved Joe Biden closer to formally clinching the Democratic presidential nomination. In all, nine states and the District of Columbia held elections, including four that delayed their April contests because of the coronavirus outbreak. Biden easily won Indiana, which was the first state to begin closing polls at 7 p.m. Voting continued across Washington, D.C. and Pennsylvania, two places rocked by protests following the police killing of George Floyd. The dynamic was especially intense in Washington, where Mayor Muriel Bowser imposed a 7 p.m. curfew as law enforcement agencies and National Guard troops prepared for a fifth night of social unrest near the White House. A large fence was erected in front of the White House and military vehicles blocked some streets in downtown. While voters cast ballots from Maryland to Montana, Pennsylvania offered the day's biggest trove of delegates. The state also represented a significant test case for Republicans and Democrats working to strengthen their operations in a premier general election battleground. In-person voting numbers were down in every state as many voters were encouraged to vote by mail because of the coronavirus pandemic. Yet there were reports of long lines, particularly in minority communities in the Philadelphia area, where election officials consolidated the vast majority of polling places to minimize health risks, according to Erin Kramer, executive director of One Pennsylvania. She noted that some polling places in African American communities are in police stations. ""Having to stand in line while police officers are entering and exiting the building on police business is not exactly how people want to spend their election day,"" Kramer said. Biden was on the primary ballot in almost every state in his bid to unify Democrats behind his campaign against Trump. The former vice president is already the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, given that all his rivals have dropped out of the race, but he needs to win 89% of all delegates at stake on Tuesday to formally clinch the nomination. If he doesn't secure the needed delegates Tuesday, he has other opportunities to do so this month. Biden was in Philadelphia on Tuesday morning to deliver remarks about the civil unrest that has erupted across the nation. He didn't talk about the primary, instead focusing his attention on Trump, whom Biden blasted as ""more interested in power than in principle."" Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is not actively campaigning, having suspended his operation and endorsed Biden, but his name will appear on the ballots. On the eve of Tuesday's primaries, senior adviser Jeff Weaver encouraged progressives to vote for Sanders anyway. ""People who support Bernie Sanders and his agenda, who want to maximize the influence of progressives at the convention, should cast their vote for Bernie Sanders,"" Weaver said, reminding voters that the Vermont senator is seeking leverage to shape the party's platform and rules. The comments serve as a reminder that Biden may have no legitimate Democratic rivals remaining but must still win over skeptical activists from his party's far-left flank, who worry he's too close to the political establishment. Party unity will likely be an afterthought this week, however, as more immediate health and safety concerns dominate the national conversation. The coronavirus death toll has surged past 100,000 nationwide, and thousands of new cases are reported each day. At the same time, several major cities, including some voting Tuesday, are grappling with protests. Some voters said Trump's increasingly tough tone toward protesters inspired them to participate in the democratic process. Nicholas Autiello, who works in finance in Rhode Island, said he was disturbed by police driving back peaceful demonstrators near the White House on Monday. ""Last night, we have a president who is acting like a dictator,"" Autiello said. ""So being able to come out here this morning and fill in a circle next to a name for someone who I know will restore honor and decency to the presidency was so important."" In Washington, the mayor ordered a 7 p.m. curfew, though voting places will be open until 8 p.m. Voting has been deemed essential, and city officials say voters will not be subject to arrest if they cast ballots during the curfew. Philadelphia moved its 6 p.m. curfew back to 8:30 p.m. for Tuesday to accommodate voting. ""We are in unique times, and voting is a unique challenge for people,"" said Josh Schwerin, chief strategist for the pro-Democrat super PAC Priorities USA. He said that his organization and others will be watching closely on Tuesday ""to see how well it works, where issues are and where obstacles have been put in place."" Political groups have had to adjust as some states move to a system that relies largely on voting by mail. They include Montana, where all 56 counties decided to vote entirely by mail. Voting rights watchdogs in multiple states have expressed concerns about access to mail ballots, confusion about deadlines and a shortage of poll workers that could lead to long lines. Those voting Tuesday include the District of Columbia, Indiana, Maryland, Montana, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and South Dakota. Two other states holding primary elections, Idaho and Iowa, chose its presidential nominee early in the year and is now focused on other offices. ""We think we're prepared,"" Pennsylvania Democratic Party Chairwoman Nancy Patton Mills said. ""Thank goodness we have the opportunity of working this out in the primary because we don't know where we'll be with the pandemic in November.""",0.0

Many of the protests broke out in places where the virus is still circulating widely in the population. In fact, an Associated Press review found that demonstrations have taken place in every one of the 25 U.S. communities with the highest concentrations of new cases. Some have seen major protests over multiple days, including Minneapolis-St. Paul, Chicago, Washington, D.C., and Los Angeles. The protests have come just as communities across the nation loosen restrictions on businesses and public life that have helped slow the spread of the virus, deepening concern that the two factors taken together could create a national resurgence in cases. “As a nation, we have to be concerned about a rebound,” Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser warned Sunday after days of protests rocked the nation’s capital. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo bemoaned the crowds, saying that hundreds could potentially have been infected, undoing months of social distancing. A fresh outbreak in the places where protesters gathered could lead to reinstituting shutdowns. The AP’s review focused on large metro counties — the central counties within metro areas with more than 1 million people — that showed the highest rates of new cases per capita over the past 14 days. While case numbers and deaths have been trending down in several of the cities where the largest protests have occurred, the number of people in those places infected with the virus — and with the ability to spread it — remains high. And in some of the communities, such as Minneapolis, the number of people hospitalized with COVID-19 has been rising. Floyd died May 25 after a Minneapolis police officer pressed a knee into his neck for several minutes, even as he pleaded that he couldn’t breathe. Minneapolis has been ground zero for the sprawling protests, which have crossed the Mississippi River into neighboring St. Paul. The unrest has coincided with “the very worst days of the pandemic so far” in the Twin Cities metropolitan area, said Michael T. Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota. “Our ICU bed care is at its all-time high and is really on the edge,” he said. Ramsey and Hennepin counties, home to the Twin Cities, ranked seventh and eighth for the highest per capita new cases in the AP analysis. Each has seen more than 250 cases per 100,000 population in the past two weeks, together reporting nearly 2,000 new cases in the last week alone. Experts point out that other factors associated with protests could accelerate the spread of the virus. For instance, tear gas can cause people to cough and sneeze, as can the smoke from fires set by people bent on destruction. And both also prompt protesters to remove their masks. Crowding protesters who have been arrested into jail cells can also increase the risk of contagion. An AP tally found that, thus far, more than 5,600 people have been taken into custody. Protesters and police shouting at one another nose-to-nose also is raising alarms. Osterholm and other public health experts note, however, that the protests aren’t necessarily as alarming as other events that could fuel new cases because they take place outside and many people are wearing masks. In some cases, hand sanitizer also is being informally distributed. And Dr. David Eisenman, director of the Center for Public Health and Disasters at the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health, said he feared partisan forces might accuse cities of bringing fresh cases on themselves. “I’m actually more worried about how, if those spikes occur, how that information will be weaponized against the notion of protests,” he said. Eisenman called protesting an “essential activity,” possible to practice with reduced risk. He said his grown children protested in Los Angeles and are taking safety precautions now, including isolating themselves at home. They plan to get tested for COVID-19 in about a week. Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician and public health professor at George Washington University, said the hospitalizations for coronavirus in the Washington metro area have been on the decline but that she knows that could change. “There are a lot of unknowns about what happens next,” she said. Wen was the health commissioner for the city of Baltimore during the 2015 uprising after the death of Freddie Gray in police custody and said many health clinics were closed and pharmacies burned down, making it difficult for members of disadvantaged communities to access health care. It’s a concern for her now, too. “You will have compounded health issues that go beyond COVID-19,” she said. Public health experts said it will take two to three weeks to know whether the protests cause a surge in coronavirus cases. And even then, they can’t definitively tie it to the demonstrations. The unrest is happening in tandem with the reopening of gyms, hair salons, restaurants, parks and beaches. It also comes on the heels of the Memorial Day weekend, when many people attended large gatherings, so experts already were bracing for a case increase, said Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins University. In Los Angeles, barbershops and in-person dining were allowed to resume last weekend, just as protests descended into destruction and more than 1,000 people were arrested. Nearly 10,000 new cases have been reported in Los Angeles County in the past week. Hundreds of people also were arrested in Chicago, where Cook County has had among the highest per capita rates of new cases of any large county in the nation, with 283 new cases per 100,000 population in the past two weeks. “The absolute number of cases is still high. We feel good about the fact that we’ve established a decreasing incidence, but we have a ways to go,” said Dr. Ronald Hershow the director of the Division of Epidemiology and Biostatistics at the University of Illinois-Chicago. Hershow and others noted that the racial disparities laid bare by coronavirus — with communities of color bearing a disproportionate burden of infections and deaths — overlap with the issues being protested on streets across America and around the globe. “Racism kills,” Hershow said. “Sometimes that’s direct, as in the case of George Floyd. And sometimes it’s through a virus like COVID-19.” ___ Forster reported from Berkley, Massachusetts. Copyright 2020 Associated Press. All rights reserved.",0.0

House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler announced Tuesday that the panel will hear testimony from whistleblowers and former department officials who are prepared to describe ""specific incidents of misconduct"" and the politicization of the department under Barr and President Donald Trump. Nadler did not say who the whistleblowers are, and the hearing has not yet been scheduled. Nadler said the committee will also introduce a bill to slash the budget of Barr's personal office by $50 million, legislation that is unlikely to pass in the GOP-led Senate. Barr has failed to appear before the committee for the year and a half he has been in office. He was scheduled to testify in March, but that hearing was canceled when Congress left town due to the coronavirus pandemic. Nadler said the panel has been unable to reschedule the appearance since. ""Mr. Barr has thoroughly corrupted the integrity of the criminal justice system, he has shown contempt for Congress, and the committee has an obligation to hold him to account,"" Nadler said. The Justice Department sent Nadler a letter this week citing White House guidance that cabinet-level officials are not permitted to participate in congressional hearings during the month of June without approval from White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, according to a person at the Justice Department familiar with the message. The person was not permitted to publicly release the letter and requested anonymity. The letter said Barr would be happy to consider testimony when that guidance expires, or at the ""return of regular order to the House of Representatives."" Republicans have criticized House Democratic leaders for suspending most in-person activities during the coronavirus epidemic. Tensions have been high between Barr and the House panel ever since the attorney general declined to show up at a 2019 hearing on special counsel Robert Mueller's report. Since then, committee Democrats have repeatedly said that Barr was politicizing the department as a way to protect Trump, including by overruling prosecutors to lower the amount of prison time it would seek for Trump confidant Roger Stone and by requesting the dismissal of its own criminal case against former Trump administration national security adviser Michael Flynn. Nadler said the panel would file an amicus brief in the Flynn case. Nadler also criticized Barr for his role on Monday as officers under federal command used smoke canisters and pepper balls to force back peaceful demonstrators outside the White House so Trump could walk to a nearby church and pose with a Bible. Barr was part of Trump's entourage and was in Lafayette Park watching the demonstrations just before officers pushed back the crowd. Barr told Congress he couldn't find the time to testify because of the coronavirus pandemic, Nadler said, ""but took the time to tour the peaceful protests at Lafayette Park"" before the chaos unfolded. Barr ordered law enforcement officials to clear the park, a person familiar with the matter told The Associated Press. The person could not discuss the matter publicly and spoke to AP on condition of anonymity. ___ Associated Press writer Michael Balsamo contributed to this story. Copyright 2020 Associated Press.

The federal government has deployed law enforcement officials from numerous agencies, and National Guard troops from a number of states have been sent to the District of Columbia. Attorney General William Barr, who is directing the federal law enforcement response in the city, promised by Tuesday ""even greater law enforcement resources and support in the region."" District of Columbia Mayor Muriel Bowser said the Trump administration floated the idea of taking over the Metropolitan Police Department, a proposal she strongly rejected. She threatened to take legal action if the federal government attempted to do so. But there were signs that the federal response would be even more aggressive Tuesday night, as Washington prepared for a fifth night of protests. Hours before a 7 p.m. curfew for the second night in a row, cars were being stopped at military checkpoints in downtown Washington and a cavalry of armored military vehicles could be seen driving through the district. Businesses were boarding up windows with plywood in anticipation of another night of violence after fires were set, windows were shattered, store shelves were emptied and dozens of police officers were injured in days of protests. Two Defense Department officials said the Trump administration had ordered military aircraft to fly above Washington on Monday night as a ""show of force"" against demonstrators protesting the death of Floyd, a black man who died after a white Minneapolis policeman pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes even after Floyd stopped moving and pleading for air. Police made over 300 arrests, mainly for violating the district's curfew. Earlier Monday evening, law enforcement officers on foot and horseback moved aggressively to clear protesters away from Lafayette Park near the White House in advance of President Donald Trump's walk to a nearby church for a photo opportunity. After participating in the show of force, Arlington County in Virginia pulled out its officers, saying they were used ""for a purpose not worthy of our mutual aid obligations."" County Board Chair Libby Garvey said on Twitter she's ""appalled"" that the mutual aid agreement was abused ""for a photo op."" In a phone interview, Garvey said the aid request came from U.S. Park Police, and that the agencies have aided each other routinely over the years. She said Arlington Police had helped in Washington on Saturday and Sunday without incident. Arlington County officials said in a statement their officers never wielded their batons and did not fire rubber bullets or tear gas. But after watching the scene unfold on live television, the police chief ordered all the officers to return to Virginia. ""This unprecedented decision by the County was a necessary response to an unprecedented situation,"" the statement said. Officials said they were reevaluating the mutual aid agreements to ensure officers ""are never again put in a situation where they are asked to take action that is inconsistent with our values."" The U.S. Park Police on Tuesday defended its actions at the park, saying it issued three warnings over a loudspeaker before clearing the area of protesters, some of whom they said were becoming violent, throwing projectiles and trying to grab weapons. It said it used smoke canisters and pepper balls to disperse the crowd. Barr ordered law enforcement officials to clear the park and push back the perimeter around the White House when he arrived there Monday evening, ahead of the president's remarks, leading to police using force to disperse protesters, a person familiar with the matter told the AP. Officials had met Monday morning and decided the perimeter had to be moved by at least one full block, which was expected to happen by Monday afternoon, after multiple fires were set in the park the night before, the person said. When Barr arrived, he was surprised it hadn't been done and directed action to be taken, according to the person, who could not discuss the matter publicly and spoke to AP on condition of anonymity. Monday, in a call with governors, Trump and Barr had encouraged more aggressive action against those who cause violence during protests across the country. The call raised questions about whether using more aggressive law enforcement measures against demonstrators protesting police brutality would only increase tensions. Trump said he was ""taking immediate presidential action to stop the violence and restore security and safety in America."" The president urged governors to deploy the National Guard, which he credited with helping calm the situation Sunday night in Minneapolis, and demanded that similarly tough measures be taken in cities that also experienced spasms of violence, including New York, Philadelphia and Los Angeles. ""Mayors and governors must establish an overwhelming law enforcement presence until the violence has been quelled,"" Trump said. Between the protests and the response to the coronavirus pandemic, the National Guard has been deployed at its highest level in recent history, surpassing the number of troops sent to the Gulf Coast during Hurricane Katrina in 2005. More than 66,700 soldiers and airman have been activated — 45,000 to assist with the pandemic and more than 17,000 to help with the protests. The federal government has provided all affected states with a list of National Guard resources available to them, a White House official said. The official added that Trump's message to governors was if they don't utilize all of the tools in their arsenal they shouldn't expect a sympathetic response from Washington if they request federal dollars to help with clean-up and recovery down the line. The official could not discuss the matter publicly and spoke to AP on condition of anonymity. Other law enforcement resources are also being mobilized in Washington. The Justice Department had deployed agents from every one of its agencies, including the FBI's Hostage Rescue Team, an elite tactical unit, and riot teams from the Bureau of Prisons. The U.S. Park Police and Secret Service have had dozens of officers out in riot gear in Washington for the last few nights, in addition to the Metropolitan Police Department. U.S. Customs and Border Protection and other Homeland Security agencies were also dispatched. Most of the protesters have been peaceful and tried to discourage violence. Trump, Barr and others have tried to blame some of the civil unrest on left-wing extremist groups, including antifa, and other ""anarchists."" Short for anti-fascists, antifa is an umbrella term for far-left-leaning militant groups that resist neo-Nazis and white supremacists at demonstrations. The Justice Department has vowed to treat the ""violence instigated and carried out by antifa & other similar groups"" as domestic terrorism. Although there isn't a specific federal domestic terrorism statute, prosecutors could charge other offenses and seek enhanced sentencing. The U.S. military and National Guard are operating in Washington under the official mission name Operation Themis, according to two Pentagon officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to do so publicly. In Greek mythology, Themis was a titaness of divine law and order, whose symbols are the scales of justice. Army Lt. Col. Chris Mitchell, a Pentagon spokesperson, said they were not aware of the operational name but said it's possible. The Associated Press reviewed a Defense Department document that showed the DC response is under the banner of Operation Themis. The document was marked unclassified. ___ Associated Press writers Zeke Miller, Lolita C.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of Calif., reading from the Bible, reacts to President Donald Trump during a news conference at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, Tuesday, June 2, 2020. (Source: AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta) Pelosi invoked Biblical scripture to reject Trump's clampdown on peaceful protesters outside the White House and she drew on past presidents — including George H.W. Bush in the aftermath of the Rodney King unrest and Barack Obama following the death of Eric Garner — as models of the nation's chief executive at a time of crisis. ""We would hope that the president of the United States would follow the lead of so many presidents before him to be a healer in chief and not a fanner of the flame,"" Pelosi said. As pleas for reconciliation over the country's long struggle with racial inequality were met with demands for accountability over George Floyd's death at the hands of police in Minneapolis, there was a shifting tone coming from Congress. Gone are the days when ""Black Lives Matter"" protests were met simply with ""Blue Lives Matter"" retorts in support of law enforcement. Instead, Congress seems to have heard the protesters outside its doors. ""You can understand the outrage,"" McConnell, the Republican Senate leader, said. McConnell said it's not only the death of Floyd at the hands of white police in Minnesota drawing protesters into the streets, but of other African Americans, including Breonna Taylor in his home-state of Kentucky. ""There is no question that there is residual racism in America,"" McConnell told reporters. ""It's been a longtime dilemma and we all wish we could get to a better place."" As the world watches a nation in turmoil, Democrats and some Republicans are swiftly preparing inquiries into the president's actions against the protesters and a legislative response to the police violence and racial inequality at the heart of marches erupting in communities nationwide. Some lawmakers, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., joined the protests. Trump was widely criticized for clearing protesters late Monday from outside the White House so he could walk across the street to hold up a Bible outside historic St. John's Church. It was viewed as a photo opportunity and criticized by the congregation's bishop. McConnell declined to directly comment on Trump's handling of the crisis. However, several Republicans on Tuesday suggested it would be better if Trump helped calm the nation rather than escalate the already tense conditions in Washington and across the country. ""I'm against clearing out a peaceful protest for a photo op that treats the Word of God as a political prop,"" said Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Nebraska, in a statement. ""Every public servant in America should be lowering the temperature."" Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer called on Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Army Gen. Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to refuse the use of military helicopters and tear gas for ""ugly stunts"" like the one Monday. Senate Democrats proposed, and Republicans rejected, a resolution condemning the president's actions. McConnell offered instead a resolution condemning rioting and police violence against black Americans, which Schumer rebuffed as insufficient. Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas said he was ""glad the president led"" by clearing the protesters from the park. Cruz and other Republicans blamed outside agitators from the ""antifa"" anti-fascist movement for intervening in otherwise peaceful protests that resulted in looting and other property damage. Still, for a growing number of lawmakers there is an undeniable pattern of inequality in the treatment of black Americans by law enforcement, and they want to address it. Several Republicans, including Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, called Floyd's death a ""murder."" One, Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., said he understood there's a difference between his experience telling his sons to call the police if they need help and black families warning children to be cautious around law enforcement so as not to risk being harmed. ""That's a different kind of America and I think people are understanding those protests make sense,"" Blunt said. More than 40 bills — from banning police choke holds and racial profiling to preventing the federal transfer of military equipment to local law enforcement to a long-sought federal anti-lynching law — are now under consideration on Capitol Hill. One House Democrat probed the Secret Service for any communication about Trump's ordering the clampdown on protesters outside the White House. Using words like ""dictator,"" ""fascist"" and other terms to describe Trump's actions, Democrats pleaded with Americans to stand with those working to improve police treatment of minority populations. ""Racism is bad for everyone,"" said Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif. She and Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., among the nation's few black senators post-Reconstruction, spoke of their own childhoods growing up in civil rights era, a legacy of the nation's long path toward a more inclusive and representative government. With the Capitol still partly closed due to the coronavirus, a pandemic that is disproportionately striking black Americans, Congress is now confronting another deepening crisis. The Congressional Black Caucus announced a virtual town hall Friday with civil rights leaders, and House Judiciary Committee chairman Jerrold Nadler is planning a hearing next week on policing. Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., said House lawmakers could be recalled to Washington this month to vote on legislation to address police and other reforms. Schumer urged McConnell to consider law enforcement reforms legislation by July 4. ___ Associated Press writer Matthew Daly contributed to this report. Copyright 2020 Associated Press.

On Saturday, May 30, about 10:55 p.m., uniformed officers wearing SWAT vests and helmets were in an unmarked van, with the door open, and two were assigned to deploy 40-mm marking rounds to disperse crowds. The van was driving down Lake Street, flanked by two marked squad cars. As they approached 14th Avenue South, a group of people were in a parking lot. Several ran away, but a man — later identified as Jaleel Kevin Stalllings, 27 — walked toward law enforcement. He crouched down as if he was picking something up. Officers said they were concerned something was going to be thrown at them and deployed one marking round at Stallings. An officer “almost immediately … saw three to four gunshot muzzle flashes from Stallings’ chest toward law enforcement,” according to the criminal complaint. “One round sparked and ricocheted in front of officers.” The officer believed a separate officer in front of him had been shot. Another officer saw Stallings fire the shots from hip level at law enforcement; the officer reported fearing for his life and also believed his partner had been shot, the complaint said. Body camera footage corroborated the two officers’ statements. Stallings ran and took cover behind a vehicle and officers approached it from all sides. Stallings resisted arrest and an officer, using physical force, took him into custody, the complaint said. The officer saw an AK-47-style Mini Draco Style pistol near the vehicle’s bumper. Police took a statement from Stallings on Sunday. He asked if anyone had been killed and, when he was told no, said he wanted to speak with an attorney, according to the complaint. The charges against Stallings include two counts of attempted second-degree murder and four counts of assault. An attorney for Stallings was not listed in the court record.  ",0.0

1623751887,2020-06-02 19:26:49,GOP senators offer rare rebuke of Trump on church visit,https://www.valleynewslive.com/content/news/GOP-senators-offer-rare-rebuke-of-Trump-on-church-visit--570968061.html,en,True,"politics and government, united states politics and government, religion and churches, church-state relations, demonstrations and riots",86247,valleynewslive.com,http://www.valleynewslive.com/#spider,"A handful of GOP senators spoke out Tuesday against President Donald Trump, criticizing his visit to a church after police removed peaceful demonstrators from a park near the White House. The remarks came even as most Republicans continued to avoid any disapproval of the president. President Donald Trump holds a Bible as he visits outside St. John's Church across Lafayette Park from the White House Monday, June 1, 2020, in Washington. Part of the church was set on fire during protests on Sunday night. (Source: AP Photo/Patrick Semansky) In a memorable scene captured live on television, police cleared Lafayette Park so Trump could walk to nearby St. John's Church and pose with a Bible. Trump's actions drew widespread condemnation from Democrats and religious leaders who said he was misusing the Bible and the church where presidents have prayed for more than 150 years. Some Republicans joined in the criticism on Tuesday. ""There is no right to riot, no right to destroy others' property ... but there is a fundamental — a Constitutional — right to protest, and I'm against clearing out a peaceful protest for a photo op that treats the Word of God as a political prop,'' said Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse. South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, the only black Republican in the Senate, said Trump's visit to the church was unhelpful and not something Scott would have done. ""Obviously, if your question is, should you use tear gas to clear a path so the president can go have a photo-op, the answer is no,"" Scott told Politico Tuesday, while noting he did not personally see the incident. Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, said it was ""painful to watch peaceful protesters be subjected to tear gas in order for the president to go across the street to a church that I believe he's attended only once.'' While Americans are justifiably upset that the historic church was set on fire and vandalized, ""I thought that the president came across as unsympathetic and insensitive,'' she said. Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla., called Trump's walk to the church ""confrontational"" and said it ""distracted from his important message in the Rose Garden about our national grief, racism, peaceful protests and lawful assembly.'' That message ""was drowned out by an awkward photo op,'' Lankford said. Sasse, who has at times criticized Trump but won his endorsement for reelection, said public officials nationwide ""should be lowering the temperature"" over protests and violence following the death in police custody of George Floyd, an unarmed black man, in Minnesota. Four Minneapolis police officers have been fired and one has been charged with murder in Floyd's death. ""Police injustice — like the evil murder of George Floyd — is repugnant and merits peaceful protest aimed at change,'' Sasse said, adding that ""riots are abhorrent acts of violence that hurt the innocent.'' Both messages should be heard as Americans work to end violence and injustice, Sasse said. Late Tuesday, Trump addressed his GOP critics. ""You got it wrong!"" he tweeted. ""If the protesters were so peaceful, why did they light the Church on fire the night before? People liked my walk to this historic place of worship!"" The comments by the GOP senators were among the strongest by Republicans following Trump's demand Monday to end the heated protests and his vow to use military force to achieve that if necessary. Republicans have frequently muted any criticism of Trump, and only GOP Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah voted in favor of Trump's impeachment in February. South Dakota Sen. John Thune, the second-ranking GOP senator, said that ""as a general matter, I always think it's a good thing for our elected leaders to be spending time at church.'' Still, Thune said views of Trump's actions were ""going to be in the eye of the beholder. His supporters are going to think ... he was standing up for the things he believes in and they believe in. His detractors are going to say it was a photo op.'' Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, said Trump likely ""thought this would be some unifying message, but of course it was for half the country, and the other half were outraged by it. And that's just where we are, sadly."" On Trump's threat to send in the military to quell violence, Cornyn and Thune said they hope Trump does not resort to that. While Trump ""arguably"" has the authority to use military force, ""so far he hasn't done it,'' Cornyn said. ""Hopefully, he won't do it. It won't be necessary. And we will try to bring some peace back to our communities."" Thune said he would ""prefer that these things be handled by the state and local authorities. You want to de-escalate, rather than escalate."" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said Tuesday that ""Democrats' obsession with condemning President Trump"" was blinding them to more urgent priorities, such as ""ending the riots or advancing racial justice.'' McConnell condemned rioting in his home city of Louisville and other cities, even as he said the nation is united in horror and opposition to Floyd's death. ""The legitimate and important voices of peaceful protesters will never be heard over the wailing of fire alarms, the smashing of plate-glass windows, and the sirens of ambulances coming for police officers who have been assaulted or shot in the head,'' McConnell said. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said he was glad Trump went to a ""historic church in our capital city that was firebombed by terrorists. It was important for the president to be there and say we will not be cowed by terrorists. All of us have a First Amendment right to speak, but you don't have a right to burn a church.'' Collins, who is considered one of the Senate's most vulnerable incumbents, said that at a time when the president ""ought to be trying to calm the nation,"" Trump did not do that. __ Associated Press writers Andrew Taylor, Mary Clare Jalonick and Padmananda Rama contributed to this story.

In all, nine states and the District of Columbia held primary elections to decide a series of state and federal contests, including the 2020 presidential race . With no real competition, Biden and President Donald Trump easily won their respective primary elections in Indiana, Rhode Island, Maryland, New Mexico, Montana and the night's biggest prize: Pennsylvania. Biden also won South Dakota. Voters waited in long lines hours after polls closed in some cases, brushing up against curfews in Washington, D.C., and Philadelphia, two cities rocked by protests following the police killing of George Floyd. Officials in both places said voters wouldn't be arrested for breaking curfew, but thousands of protesters defied the mayors' orders at the same time, setting up a potential clash with law enforcement agencies and National Guard troops patrolling the streets during a fifth night of social unrest. Pennsylvania, which offered the day's biggest trove of delegates, also represented a significant test case for Republicans and Democrats working to strengthen their operations in a premier general election battleground. Voters were forced to brave long lines in “militarized zones” because officials consolidated the vast majority of polling places in Philadelphia to minimize health risks, according to Erin Kramer, executive director of One Pennsylvania. She noted that some polling places in African American communities are in police stations. “Having to stand in line while police officers are entering and exiting the building on police business is not exactly how people want to spend their election day,” Kramer said. Biden was on the primary ballot in almost every state in his bid to unify Democrats behind his campaign against Trump. The former vice president is already the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, given that all his rivals have dropped out of the race, but he needs to win 89% of all delegates at stake on Tuesday to formally clinch the nomination. If he doesn't secure the needed delegates Tuesday, he has other opportunities to do so this month. Biden was in Philadelphia on Tuesday morning to deliver remarks about the civil unrest that has erupted across the nation. He didn’t talk about the primary, instead focusing his attention on Trump, whom Biden blasted as “more interested in power than in principle.” Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is not actively campaigning, having suspended his operation and endorsed Biden, but his name will appear on the ballots. On the eve of Tuesday's primaries, senior adviser Jeff Weaver encouraged progressives to vote for Sanders anyway. “People who support Bernie Sanders and his agenda, who want to maximize the influence of progressives at the convention, should cast their vote for Bernie Sanders,” Weaver said, reminding voters that the Vermont senator is seeking leverage to shape the party's platform and rules. The comments serve as a reminder that Biden may have no legitimate Democratic rivals remaining but must still win over skeptical activists from his party’s far-left flank, who worry he’s too close to the political establishment. Party unity will likely be an afterthought this week, however, as more immediate health and safety concerns dominate the national conversation. The coronavirus death toll has surged past 100,000 nationwide, and thousands of new cases are reported each day. At the same time, several major cities, including some voting Tuesday, are grappling with protests. Some voters said Trump’s increasingly tough tone toward protesters inspired them to participate in the democratic process. Nicholas Autiello, who works in finance in Rhode Island, said he was disturbed by police driving back peaceful demonstrators near the White House on Monday. “Last night, we have a president who is acting like a dictator,” Autiello said. “So being able to come out here this morning and fill in a circle next to a name for someone who I know will restore honor and decency to the presidency was so important.” Political groups have had to adjust as some states move to a system that relies largely on voting by mail. They include Montana, where all 56 counties decided to vote entirely by mail. Voting rights watchdogs in multiple states have expressed concerns about access to mail ballots, confusion about deadlines and a shortage of poll workers that could lead to long lines. Those voting Tuesday include the District of Columbia, Indiana, Maryland, Montana, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and South Dakota. Two other states holding primary elections, Idaho and Iowa, chose its presidential nominee early in the year and is now focused on other offices. “We are in unique times, and voting is a unique challenge for people,” said Josh Schwerin, chief strategist for the pro-Democrat super PAC Priorities USA. He said that his organization and others will be watching closely on Tuesday “to see how well it works, where issues are and where obstacles have been put in place.” ___ Associated Press writer Rodrique Ngowi in Providence, R.I., and Terry Spencer in West Palm Beach, Fla., contributed to this report. ___ Catch up on the 2020 election campaign with AP experts on our weekly politics podcast, “Ground Game.” ___ This story has been corrected to show there are nine states voting, not seven.

PAUL -- The Twin Cities witnessed 87 fires in five days during the heat of recent unrest, officials said Tuesday in announcing a new task force to track down arsonists believed to be responsible for a large portion of them. “Eighty-seven’s an enormous number,” Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington said at an afternoon news conference, citing figures from the state fire marshal’s office. Under normal circumstances, that period might see one or two fires, he said. Fires have blazed across St. Paul and Minneapolis over the past week as rioting, arson and looting punctuated mass protests over last week’s death of George Floyd, a black man who died when a white Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck for more than eight minutes.

The speculation was being raised by conservative news outlets and pro-Trump social media accounts, as well as impostor Facebook and Twitter accounts. Twitter and Facebook busted some of the instigators behind the unsubstantiated social media chatter. Twitter determined Monday that a tweet promising antifa would “move into residential areas” and “white” neighborhoods was sent by the white supremacy group Identity Evropa. The tweet was shared hundreds of times and cited in online news articles before Twitter removed it Monday, a company spokesperson said. Yet the tweet continued to circulate Tuesday on Facebook and Instagram. Facebook, using information shared by Twitter, announced Tuesday night it also took down a handful of accounts on its platform that were created by whites supremacy groups like Identity Evropa and American Guard, some of them posing as part of the antifa movement. For years, some social media users have tried to delegitimize controversial or political protests with baseless theories that they were organized by wealthy financiers or extremists organizations. Over the weekend, Trump singled out antifa as being responsible for the violent protests triggered by the killing of George Floyd, saying in a tweet: “It’s ANTIFA and the Radical Left.” “Usually you see this when there’s an interest to deflect conversations from protests to just accusing the protests of being violent, organized or having backers that are evil,”said Filippo Menczer, a professor of informatics and computer science at Indiana University. “The president mentioning it, of course, has generated a huge spike.” The theories about antifa — short for “anti-fascists” and an umbrella term for lefitst militant groups that confront or resist neo-Nazis and white supremacists at demonstrations — have trickled through cities across the country in recent days. Police departments say people are phoning in “tips” they see on social media claiming antifa is sending buses or even planes full of antifa activists to their area. In Payette County, Idaho — a rural county of 24,000 — the calls started early Monday morning after one Facebook user said the sheriff had spotted antifa rioters in the area. The calls didn’t taper off until the sheriff’s office debunked the rumor on Facebook. “It’s really a small community, where our citizens know us pretty well,” said Payette County Sheriff Lt. Andy Creech. “When the post got out there, we started getting phone calls directly.” Meanwhile, Facebook users were also warning their friends to stay clear of a shopping center in a New Jersey suburb, saying it would be the center of antifa destruction on Tuesday. But police had “no credible information” that antifa would be present in the area, Toms River Police Department media specialist Jillian Messina said in an email. The police aren’t aware of anyone showing up at all, she added. Identical Facebook and Twitter posts about busloads of antifa protesters also stumped the Sioux Falls Police Department, where officers in the South Dakota city said they didn’t see any unusual bus activity in town. But the claims still spread for days ahead of a planned protest this Saturday, said Sam Clemens, a public information officer for the department. “Everyone heard there were going to be buses of people,” Clemens said. “It was very specific: there were three busloads.” Even the owner of a Michigan limousine business was forced to refute online rumors when two of his buses became the center of a conspiracy theory that liberal financier George Soros was funneling protesters to Milan, Michigan. Social media users widely shared a manipulated photo of his white buses, edited to show the words “Soros Riot Dance squad” emblazoned on the sides. The buses belong to Sean Duval, the owner of local transportation company Golden Limousine International, and don’t have any words printed on them. Said Duval: “It’s frustrating when people from the outside start instigating and try to turn American against American.” ___ Associated Press writers Barbara Ortutay in Oakland, Calif., Beatrice Dupuy in New York and Ali Swenson in Seattle contributed to this report.

Kara Hall, a visual arts teacher at Forestview in Baxter, appeared to make the comments on a Facebook post by a former lakes area resident who detailed her experience taking part in protests following the death of African American man George Floyd, who died in police custody May 25. Hall’s comments called out black people for destroying businesses and included: “Are you seeing what the blacks people are doing during this ‘protest?’” “They are destroying properties and businesses.” “Maybe you should be out there telling them to stop burning businesses if they are such good people? I know all I see are scary awful blacks people robbing businesses that don’t deserve this. They are making it worse for themselves.” Another comment from Hall criticizing Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey and calling for law and order to be restored included: “The creepy, destructive, violent blacks we are all across America watching raid and ruin businesses across America need to be put in jail!

I watch black guys carry out cases of whiskey while they smile and laugh — that’s not ok and that’s not protesting — that’s opportunistic, theft anc (sic) illegal.” listen live watch live Hall’s Facebook profile is no longer visible, and she did not respond to an email or voicemail requesting comment.

She included contact information for district leaders. The post made late Monday morning has since gotten more than 200 comments and more than 300 shares. A majority of the comments on the post came from parents and district residents who said they were furious with Hall’s comments, which they deemed unacceptable and blatantly racist. Many commenters said they, too, emailed and called the school district to express their concern. After seeing Hall’s comments, two Brainerd High School graduates wrote an open letter to school district leaders explaining why the comments were racist and how Hall’s employment in ISD 181 threatens an equitable learning environment for all students. In the letter, Hannah Kangas and Anna Gardner, Brainerd High School graduates of 2013 and 2015, respectively, called for Hall’s immediate termination. They refer to the Minnesota Human Rights Act, which prohibits discrimination based on race, sex, religion, creed, national origin, disability, sexual orientation and other protected classes of people. READ THE LETTER HERE: Open letter to Independent School District 181 “Ms. Hall’s derogatory comments demonstrate a reasonable threat to violating these human rights of not only students of a ‘protected class,’ but our community at large,” the letter states. “As someone who has gone through the ISD 181 system and received an excellent education, it is unjust to me that this education should be inequitable to all of the community members.” The letter included a statement from a black community member who attended schools in the district and now has children living within the Brainerd School District. Kangas said this community member, who is a friend of hers, wished to remain anonymous because this isn’t just her story but the story of so many kids of color who have been through the same, or worse, situations. The community member said in the letter she was heartbroken that anyone would see her or anyone in her family as a “scary, awful black.” “The number of the black community in Brainerd is growing and I’m hoping that it helps push people out of their comfort zone to at least get to know us to be able to tell we are far from ‘scary animals,’” the statement said. “No teacher will be teaching my children of color, if she reduces their lives to scary awful black kids.” While recognizing educators as crucial factors in how students learn to think and engage critically in the world, the letter stated the district should not allow for an educator who imposes emotional duress on members of the community. “We ask that Ms. Hall is held accountable for her failure to represent ISD 181’s values and that she is a reasonable threat to violating the Minnesota Human Rights Act within the public school system,” the letter stated. “We would implore that you consider termination given the potential for future impact on Black, Indigenous, and students of color within ISD 181. Personal bias can bleed into professional bias, thus creating a toxic and discriminatory education experience, which is protected against by the MHRA.” The letter writers said they believe Hall’s inflammatory comments are not isolated, meaning there needs to be structural change to prevent a similar occurrence from happening again Kangas and Gardner also started a petition at https://bit.ly/2Y8tmR5 calling for Hall’s termination. As of Tuesday evening, the petition had more than 3,000 signatures. Both the letter — signed by 14 Brainerd High School alumni — and the petition call for district administrators to take the following actions: Accountability for Hall's remarks as a failure to represent the values of ISD 181, as well as being a potential threat to the rights provided to students in the Minnesota Human Rights Act, through her termination. Clearly stated within the ISD 181 handbook, hiring contracts and other relevant documents that discriminatory remarks are not tolerated under the MHRA and will result in a fitting punishment, such as termination or suspension without pay. Creation of an oversight board that can field internal and external reports of bias and discrimination. The members of this board would be democratically elected in a similar manner as the Board of Education. Add a code of conduct to the ISD 181 employee handbook in alignment with the Minnesota Human Rights Act and make this handbook publicly accessible. The letter writers added they find the district’s current policy on handling complaints of this nature is inadequate in stating students’ rights and asserted the district should have a more democratic process for the complaints. Hearing from the community One district parent who wished to not be named but agreed to share her story said Hall is the exact reason she pulled her son out of Forestview Middle School. The parent, whose son is half African American, said Hall once allegedly made disparaging remarks regarding him and other black students. The Dispatch submitted a public data request to the school district for information on any formal complaints made against Hall during her time in the district. Shannon Porter, a Native American mom with children in the district, said her initial reaction to the comments was shock. She said racist remarks are never OK but are likely going to happen. “But there’s certain career fields that you don’t really have the luxury of thinking like that,” Porter said during a phone interview Tuesday. “You have to be open to different races that you’re going to encounter.” Porter said she is concerned about her daughter — who will be in fourth grade next year — being in Hall’s class when she eventually gets to Forestview. “How will that teacher perceive her?” Porter said. “... Will she get a fair shake in that class? Will she be treated fairly in that class?” As a parent, Porter requests a fair investigation from the district. She said she doesn’t know the context of Hall’s statements and if they could have been made sarcastically, or if her account got hacked altogether. But if the investigation finds the statements were made in a hurtful and hateful context, Porter said she is not comfortable with Hall teaching her children and said Hall should not be employed with the district any longer. But Porter noted she was pleased with district efforts last year, when Ojibwe studies professor Anton Treuer came to speak with staff, and for implicit bias training staff underwent with Sourcewell. Another parent, Brittany Miller, said she is now concerned about sending her 10-year-old son to Forestview next year for fifth grade, as he is at such an impressionable age and questions everything. “I can’t imagine what would happen if he heard a teacher talking like that,” Miller said Tuesday, noting she emailed district administrators with her concerns. She added: “It’s putting these kids at a disadvantage to have someone with a closed mind teaching them.” Miller said she isn’t sure what the correct recourse would be in this situation or if firing Hall is the way to go but said at the very least some sort of classes or training should be required. “She can’t just go on with her life thinking that this was OK,” Miller said. “There are kids of color that are coming through those doors, and to have them know what she thinks, that can be really detrimental.” Others who commented on the parent’s Facebook post said Hall’s statements seem to have been made out of fear and not racism, and they believed she should further her education on the topic and not be fired and lose her livelihood over comments that may have been misconstrued.",0.0

Kara Hall, a visual arts teacher at Forestview in Baxter, appeared to make the comments on a Facebook post by a former lakes area resident who detailed her experience taking part in protests following the death of African American man George Floyd, who died in police custody May 25. Hall’s comments called out black people for destroying businesses and included: “Are you seeing what the blacks people are doing during this ‘protest?’” “They are destroying properties and businesses.” “Maybe you should be out there telling them to stop burning businesses if they are such good people? I know all I see are scary awful blacks people robbing businesses that don’t deserve this. They are making it worse for themselves.” Another comment from Hall criticizing Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey and calling for law and order to be restored included: “The creepy, destructive, violent blacks we are all across America watching raid and ruin businesses across America need to be put in jail!

Larson declined to comment beyond her statement. Forestview Principal Jon Anderson did not respond to a voicemail or email requesting comment. Taking action Hall’s comments garnered much attention after a Facebook post by a district parent, who posted screenshots of the comments and asked other parents how they felt. She included contact information for district leaders. The post made late Monday morning has since gotten more than 200 comments and more than 300 shares. A majority of the comments on the post came from parents and district residents who said they were furious with Hall’s comments, which they deemed unacceptable and blatantly racist. Many commenters said they, too, emailed and called the school district to express their concern. After seeing Hall’s comments, two Brainerd High School graduates wrote an open letter to school district leaders explaining why the comments were racist and how Hall’s employment in ISD 181 threatens an equitable learning environment for all students. In the letter, Hannah Kangas and Anna Gardner, Brainerd High School graduates of 2013 and 2015, respectively, called for Hall’s immediate termination.

Titled ""Appomattox,"" a statue in Alexandria, Virginia, depicted a solitary Confederate soldier, his head bowed slightly. It was erected in 1889 to honor Confederate soldiers. (Source: Twitter/Justin Wilson/CNN) A wave of Confederate memorial removals that began after a white supremacist killed nine black people at a Bible study in a church in South Carolina in 2015 is again rolling, with more relics of the Old South being removed from public view after the killing of George Floyd by police in Minnesota. In Birmingham, where Rudolph lives, the graffiti-covered, pocked base of a massive Confederate monument was all that remained Tuesday after crews dismantled the towering obelisk and trucked it away in pieces overnight. Other symbols came down elsewhere, leaving an empty pedestal in Virginia and a bare flagpole in Florida. Rudolph, whose sister Addie Mae Collins died in the bombing of 16th Street Baptist Church, had to see the sight for herself. She lowered a protective face mask to take in the absence of an edifice she long considered a symbol of oppression. ""I'm glad it's been removed because it has been so long, and we know that it's a hate monument,"" said Rudolph, 69. ""It didn't represent the blacks. It just represented the hard times back there a long time ago."" Confederate symbols across the South have been targeted for vandalism during demonstrations sparked by Floyd's death in police custody in Minneapolis. Now, even some of their longtime defenders have decided to remove them. In Alexandria, Virginia, it was the United Daughters of the Confederacy that took action early Tuesday, removing the statue of a soldier gazing south from Old Town since 1889. And outside Tampa, Florida, a Sons of Confederate Veterans chapter lowered a huge Confederate battle flag that has long been flown in view of two interstate highways. Birmingham took down the obelisk a day after protesters tried to remove the monument themselves, during one of the many nationwide protests. Crews were preparing to finish the job by pulling up the base. The monument had been the subject of a protracted court battle between the city and state, which passed a law to protect Confederate icons after rebel monuments were challenged and removed following the killings at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina. Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall filed a lawsuit on Tuesday against the city of Birmingham, seeking to fine the city $25,000 for violating the state law. Mayor Randall Woodfin said earlier this week that the fine was more affordable than the cost of continued unrest in the city. Online fundraising drives have raised more than enough money to pay the fine. The state lawsuit does not specifically ask Birmingham to restore the monument. Work to remove the monument began Monday, which was Alabama's holiday honoring Confederate President Jefferson Davis, who was sworn in Montgomery. There, on the same day, someone knocked over a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee outside a mostly black high school named for him. Four people were arrested on criminal mischief charges, and the toppled statue was removed. In Alexandria, a city spokesman said the United Daughters of the Confederacy informed the city on Monday that it would remove the statue, and the city's only role was to provide traffic support. By morning, the pedestal was all that was left. City officials were not told where the statue was taken. Titled ""Appomattox,"" it depicts a solitary Confederate soldier, his head bowed slightly. In 1890, a state law was passed barring local officials from ever removing it. That law was repealed earlier this year.

FILE - In this June 1, 2020, file photo President Donald Trump departs the White House to visit outside St. John's Church in Washington. (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky, File) Both Trump and Defense Secretary Mark Esper also drew stinging, rare public criticism from Trump's first defense secretary, Jim Mattis, in the most public pushback of Trump's presidency from the men he put at the helm of the world's most powerful military. Mattis' rebuke followed Trump's threats to use the military to ""dominate"" the streets where Americans are demonstrating following the death of George Floyd, a black man who died when a white police officer pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes. The president had urged governors to call out the National Guard to contain protests that turned violent and warned that he could send in active duty military forces if they did not. Esper angered Trump early Wednesday when he said he opposed using military troops for law enforcement, seemingly taking the teeth out of the president's threat to use the Insurrection Act. Esper said the 1807 law should be invoked in the United States ""only in the most urgent and dire of situations."" He added, ""We are not in one of those situations now."" After his subsequent visit to the White House, the Pentagon abruptly overturned an earlier decision to send a couple hundred active-duty soldiers home from the Washington, D.C., region, a public sign of the growing tensions with the White House amid mounting criticism that the Pentagon was being politicized in response to the protests. Former Secretary Mattis, a retired Marine general, lambasted both Trump and Esper in an essay in The Atlantic Wednesday for their consideration of using the active-duty military in law enforcement — and for the use of the National Guard in clearing out a largely peaceful protest near the White House on Monday evening. ""We must reject any thinking of our cities as a 'battlespace' that our uniformed military is called upon to 'dominate,'"" Mattis wrote, referencing quotes by Esper and Trump respectively. ""Militarizing our response, as we witnessed in Washington, D.C., sets up a conflict — a false conflict — between the military and civilian society. "" Trump responded on Twitter by calling Mattis ""the world's most overrated General,"" adding: ""I didn't like his 'leadership' style or much else about him, and many others agree, Glad he is gone!"" Days ago, Esper had ordered about 1,300 Army personnel to military bases just outside the nation's capital as Trump weighed whether to invoke the Insurrection Act and send active-duty troops into the city, the scene of large protests that devolved into violence and looting over the weekend. But after a night of calm enforced by a large deployment of National Guard troops and heavily armed federal law enforcement agents, defense officials said the troops would begin returning to their home base. Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy told The Associated Press that the decision was reversed after Esper's visit to the White House. The White House didn't respond to request for comment on whether Trump ordered the change. The shift added to confusion over the president's threat to invoke the Insurrection Act for protests following Floyd's death in Minneapolis. White House officials had indicated even before Esper's comments that Trump was backing away from invoking the act, though officials said Trump was upset that Esper's statement conveyed ""weakness."" Press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said the president was still willing to deploy federal troops despite Esper's comments. ""If needed, he will use it,"" she told reporters. ""But at this time he's relying on surging the streets with National Guard. It's worked with great effect."" Meanwhile, the president was taking credit for the deployment of federal and other law enforcement officers to the nation's capital, saying it offered a model to states on how to stop violence accompanying some protests nationwide. On Wednesday evening, troops and others were out in force in Washington. A Defense official said at least 2,200 National Guard members would be on the streets. Helmeted forces formed a ring around Lafayette Park across from the White House. Military vehicles were parked at intersections, also blocking access. Trump argued that the massive show of force was responsible for protests in Washington and other cities turning more calm in recent days and repeated his criticism of governors who have not deployed their National Guard to the fullest. ""You have to have a dominant force,"" Trump told Fox News Radio on Wednesday. ""We need law and order."" Asked repeatedly if Trump still had confidence in his Pentagon chief, McEnany said, ""As of right now, Secretary Esper is still Secretary Esper, and should the president lose faith we will all learn about that in the future."" Esper, in his Pentagon remarks, also strongly criticized the actions of the Minneapolis police for the incident last week that ignited the protests. He called the death of Floyd ""murder"" and ""a horrible crime."" The defense secretary himself has come under fire from critics, including retired senior military officers, for having walked from the White House on Monday evening with Trump and others for a presidential photo opportunity in front of St. John's Episcopal Church, which had previously sustained damage from protesters. Esper said that while he was aware they were heading to St. John's, he did not know what would happen there. ""I was not aware a photo op was happening,"" he said, adding that he also did not know that police had forcibly moved peaceful protesters in Lafayette Square to clear the way for Trump and his entourage. Mattis, in his essay, called the scene an ""abuse of executive authority."" The retired general quit the Trump administration in December 2018 after months of conflict with the president as Trump announced he was unilaterally withdrawing American troops from Syria. The White House laid responsibility for Monday's events in Lafayette Park on Attorney General William Barr, saying he gave the order for law enforcement to clear out the protest before Trump's walk to the church ahead of Washington's 7 p.m. curfew. McEnany said the decision was made earlier Monday but had not been executed by the time Barr arrived in the park to survey the scene. He gave the order at that time. McEnany said law enforcement conducted the operation with appropriate force, which included pepper spray and other chemical agents, and officers on horseback and batons clearing a crowd made up almost entirely of peaceful protesters. Trump put a political spin on his criticism of states that have seen violence. He said: ""You notice that all of these places that have problems, they're not run by Republicans. They're run by liberal Democrats."" Though the crackdown on the Washington demonstrations was praised by some Trump supporters Tuesday, a handful of Republicans expressed concern that law enforcement officers risked violating the protesters' First Amendment rights. The situation in Washington had escalated Monday, becoming a potent symbol of Trump's policing tactics and a physical manifestation of the rhetorical culture war he has stoked since before he was elected. The clampdown followed a weekend of demonstrations outside the White House. Trump had been furious about images juxtaposing fires set in the park outside the executive mansion with a darkened White House in the background, according to current and former campaign and administration officials. He was also angry about the news coverage revealing he had gone to the secure White House bunker during Friday's protests. Trump on Wednesday acknowledged he visited the bunker Friday but claimed he was only conducting an inspection as protests raged outside the White House gates.

Protesters gather at a memorial for George Floyd where he died outside Cup Foods on East 38th Street and Chicago Avenue, Monday, June 1, 2020, in Minneapolis. Protests continued following the death of Floyd, who died after being restrained by Minneapolis police officers on May 25. (Source: AP Photo/John Minchillo) The most serious charge was filed against Derek Chauvin, who was caught on video pressing his knee to Floyd's neck and now must defend himself against an accusation of second-degree murder. The three other officers at the scene were charged for the first time with aiding and abetting second-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. All four were fired last week. If convicted, they could be sentenced to up to four decades in prison. Chauvin was initially charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Those charges still stand. The new second-degree murder charge alleges that Chauvin caused Floyd's death without intent while committing another felony, namely third-degree assault. It carries a maximum penalty of 40 years in prison, compared with a maximum of 25 years for third-degree murder. The other officers — Thomas Lane, J. Kueng and Tou Thao — face the same maximum penalties for aiding and abetting. All three men were in custody by Wednesday evening. Chauvin was arrested last week and is still being held. The multiple charges against each officer would offer a jury more options to find them guilty. The charges were sought by Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, who called the protests unleashed by the death ""dramatic and necessary"" and said Floyd ""should be here and he is not."" ""His life had value, and we will seek justice,"" said Ellison, who cautioned that winning convictions would be hard and said that public pressure had no bearing on his decisions. Hundreds of protesters were in New York City's Washington Square Park when the charges were announced. ""It's not enough,"" protester Jonathan Roldan said, insisting all four officers should have been charged from the start. ""Right now, we're still marching because it's not enough that they got arrested. There needs to be systematic change."" Ben Crump, an attorney for Floyd's family, called it ""a bittersweet moment"" and ""a significant step forward on the road to justice."" Crump said Elison had told the family he would continue his investigation into Floyd's death and upgrade the charge to first-degree murder if warranted. The move by prosecutors punctuated an unprecedented week in modern American history, in which largely peaceful protests took place in communities of all sizes but were rocked by bouts of violence, including deadly attacks on officers, rampant thefts and arson in some places. Nationwide, more than 9,000 have been arrested in connection with unrest. At least 12 deaths have been reported, though the circumstances in many cases are still being sorted out. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, speaking after the new charges were announced, said the state and nation need to ""seize the moment"" and use the wrenching events of the past week to confront the effects of racism, including unequal educational and economic opportunities. ""I think this is probably our last shot, as a state and as a nation, to fix this systemic issue,"" he said at a news conference. Also Wednesday, the Hennepin County Medical Examiner's Office released the full autopsy report on Floyd, which noted he had previously tested positive for COVID-19, but was apparently asymptomatic. The report was released with the family's permission after summary findings Monday that said he had a heart attack while being restrained by officers. President Donald Trump has pushed the nation's governors to take a hard line against the violence. He again tweeted Wednesday: ""LAW & ORDER!"" An overpowering security force — including officers from the FBI Hostage Rescue Team, the Secret Service, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Bureau of Prisons and, according to a senior defense official, at least 2,200 National Guard soldiers — was out in force Wednesday as thousands of peaceful protesters demonstrated in the nation's capital. Some remained near the White House while others marched toward the Capitol building. Military vehicles were parked on streets near the White House, and an array of agencies kept watch from the air. An FBI plane, an Army surveillance plane and a Park Police helicopter circled overhead. At one point near the White House, protesters began singing ""Amazing Grace"" as they knelt in view of law enforcement officers in riot gear. ""We are not going anywhere!"" they chanted. There were no signs of confrontations. Protester Jade Jones, 30, said the demonstrations would continue despite the new charges. ""That's the least they could do,"" said Jones, who had been attending Washington protests for days. ""It's not going to wipe away 400 years of pain."" ""We are glad there are additional charges, but that doesn't mean justice has been served,"" she said. More than 20,000 National Guard members have been called up in 29 states to deal with the violence. In New York City, where high-end stores were looted in earlier days, some retailers fortified their property. At the luxury department store Saks Fifth Avenue, windows were boarded up, then covered in chain-link fencing and razor wire. The front of the store was guarded by a line of tattooed men with dogs. There was scuffling in some parts of the city Wednesday night, but no signs of major clashes between protesters and police. The protests have also taken root overseas. In Greece, police fired tear gas after young people attacked them Wednesday outside the U.S. Embassy in Athens. Some 4,000 protesters had been peaceful until near the end of the demonstration, when some threw gasoline bombs and stones at police. No injuries or arrests were reported. Other protests were held Wednesday in London, Helsinki, Rotterdam and Bogota, among other cities. The anger over Floyd's death has spilled into an array of racial issues across the U.S. In Philadelphia, for example, a statue of former Mayor Frank Rizzo was removed by the city Wednesday after repeatedly being targeted by vandals. Rizzo presided over a police force widely accused of racism and brutality in the 1970s. In Virginia, Gov. Ralph Northam was expected to announce plans Thursday for the removal of an iconic statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee from Richmond's prominent Monument Avenue, a senior administration official told The Associated Press. The statue in the former Confederate capital has been the target of vandalism during the protests. ___ Associated Press journalists across the U.S. contributed to this report.

With more than six years working road construction, Lopez, 23, was trying to divert traffic away from marching protesters near 45th Street on Main Avenue in West Fargo when a white Subaru Forester tried to drive around him, he said. The car stopped for a moment, tried to pass, but Lopez obstructed the car’s path again.

I knew there were toddlers,” Lopez said. listen live watch live “I tried to tell (the driver) there was a crowd and to turn away, and it seemed like he was going to slow down, but then he sped up. I wasn’t expecting him to hit me,” Lopez said. The impact made Lopez “fly up onto the hood and into the windshield, at which time (he) held on and the vehicle continued traveling westbound at approximately 40 mph for about three blocks until (he) fell off,” according to court records. When Lopez found himself clinging to the hood at increasing speeds, he panicked, he said. “I struck his windshield a couple of times to get him to stop, and he was swaying, trying to fling me off,” Lopez said. Lopez could see clearly through the car’s glass. “He had his mouth closed the whole time, and he looked me in the eye, three feet away,” Lopez said. ""Just a dead, cold stare. After he was swerving, I couldn’t hold on anymore. I feared for my life while I was clinging onto the hood, but I realized that I was obstructing his view and that I had to let go. So I pushed off and hoped for the best. At that speed, I was expecting major blunt-force trauma and life-threatening injuries.” Not wanting to get thrown beneath the car and not wanting to flip up into the air, he pushed himself to the side. “I generally felt like I was going to die,” Lopez said. He hit hard, but landed on his back, slid on the pavement and suffered severe scraping to his back and arms. And although everything happened too fast to remember clearly, he thinks a rear tire ran over his left foot, breaking bones in four places. He rolled, stood up, walked five paces, then collapsed. Protesters came to help, wrapped his bleeding arm in a sweatshirt before police and medics arrived, he said. He was taken to a hospital and treated. Now his foot and lower leg are in a cast. He survived, but will be using crutches for about five weeks. At night, sometimes the pain becomes almost unbearable, he said. Law enforcement stopped the driver, Michael Griffin, 47, at a roadblock shortly after Lopez jumped from the car. The Cass County State’s Attorney’s Office has charged Griffin with aggravated assault and reckless endangerment, both felonies. “We reviewed this case for every possible charge, and we chose the two that we thought best fit the facts,” prosecutor Joshua Traiser said. The Forum's attempts to reach Griffin by phone Tuesday, June 2, were unsuccessful. Court records did not list an attorney for him. The charges against Griffin have Black Lives Matter organizers wondering why he wasn't charged with attempted murder. “It was attempted murder,” said Anyiwei Maciek, an organizer of Fargo Marches for George Floyd. “He knew what he was doing, and he was not provoked.” If Lopez had one regret about joining the protest, it’s that he didn’t show up earlier. He joined the march shortly after noon Saturday near West Acres mall. “If someone was going to get hit, I’m glad it was me and not some small child or someone who was elderly,” said Lopez, a lifelong resident of Fargo. Lopez said he doesn’t support the violence that hit downtown Fargo Saturday night, and believes outsiders were at least partly responsible for the violence that led to riot charges against 10 people, four police officers injured, and multiple buildings vandalized. “Justice is something you need to take a stand for. I believe we did come together and we did spread awareness. But where there are peaceful protests there are also riots,” he said. What's important to Lopez is that the culture changes and racism ends. On Saturday, he believes that message was delivered. “People began to see past privilege and see the view of people of color,” he said. And the backpack that he believes saved his life — a gift from a friend — was left in the confusion at the scene, Lopez said.",0.0

George Floyd protests remain peaceful in Bismarck Despite occasionally high tensions, a third protest of police brutality in Bismarck has come and gone without any violence or clashes with officers.

Floyd, a black man, died in the custody of Minneapolis police last week. Derek Chauvin, the white now-fired officer who videos showed kneeling on Floyd's neck during the arrest, has been charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter.
