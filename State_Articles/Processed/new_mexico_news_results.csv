The album, released on Aug. 17, 1959, captured a moment when jazz was transforming from bebop to something newer, cooler and less structured. The full takes of the songs were recorded only once, with one exception, Cobb said. “Freddie Freeloader” needed to be played twice because Davis didn’t like a chord change on the first attempt, he said. Davis, who died in 1991, had some notes jotted down, but there weren’t pages of sheet music. It was up to the improvisers to fill the pages. “He’d say this is a ballad. I want it to sound like it’s floating. And I’d say, ‘OK,’ and that’s what it was,” Cobb recalled. The album received plenty of acclaim at the time, yet the critics, the band and the studio couldn’t have known it would enjoy such longevity. He and his bandmates knew the album would be a hit but didn’t realize at the time how iconic it would become. “We knew it was pretty damned good,” Cobb joked. It has sold more than 4 million copies and remains the best selling jazz album of all time. It also served as a protest album for African American men who looked to Davis and the jazz musicians to break stereotypes about jazz and black humanity. Cobb would also work with such artists as Dinah Washington, Pearl Bailey, Clark Terry, Dizzy Gillespie, Sarah Vaughan, Billie Holiday, Wynton Kelly and Stan Getz. He’d also release a number of albums on his own. He performed well into his late 80s and played in Albuquerque, New Mexico, in 2017, as part of the New Mexico Jazz Festival. Jazz fans from throughout the American Southwest came to pay their respects in what many felt was a goodbye. ADVERTISEMENTSkip ................................................................

Ah, and asked them to come in and conduct a federal investigation, which they have been on the ground there doing that. And so they will be taking, ah, uh, lead in this investigation. Advertisement President Trump says he asked FBI, Justice Dept. to expedite investigation after man died in police custody Mayor: Officer who put knee on man's neck should be charged Share Shares Copy Link Copy President Donald Trump called for justice Wednesday for the death of George Floyd after a police officer put his knee on the man's neck.It happened after a white police officer was seen on video kneeling on the neck of a handcuffed black man during an arrest, even after the man said he couldn't breathe and stopped moving.""At my request, the FBI and the Department of Justice are already well into an investigation as to the very sad and tragic death in Minnesota of George Floyd,"" Trump said on Twitter.""I have asked for this investigation to be expedited and greatly appreciate all of the work done by local law enforcement. My heart goes out to George’s family and friends. Justice will be served!""Meanwhile, the mayor of Minneapolis called Wednesday for criminal charges to be filed.Based on the video, Mayor Jacob Frey said he believes officer Derek Chauvin should be charged in Monday's death of Floyd. Chauvin and three other officers were fired Tuesday. The video recorded by a bystander shows Chauvin with his knee on Floyd's neck for several minutes as Floyd is on the ground with his face against the pavement.“I've wrestled with, more than anything else over the last 36 hours, one fundamental question: Why is the man who killed George Floyd not in jail?” said Frey, who is white.He later added: ""I saw no threat. I saw nothing that would signal that this kind of force was necessary.”But despite the officers' swift dismissals, whether the death will be considered a criminal act or something less, like excessive force, is a more complicated question that will likely take months to investigate.Protesters marched more than 2 miles Tuesday to the police precinct in that part of the city, with some damaging property and skirmishing with officers in riot gear who fired tear gas. The Star Tribune reported more conflict Wednesday night at the same precinct, with some protesters throwing rocks and bottles at police, who responded with rubber bullets and tear gas. The newspaper also reported looting at a Target store across the street from the station.Another demonstration unfolded on the street outside Chauvin's suburban home. An officer told protesters that Chauvin was not there. Red cans of paint were earlier spilled on his driveway, and someone wrote “murderer” in chalk at the end of his driveway. No one answered when an Associated Press reporter knocked on the door.Video: Aerials show protests in Los AngelesMany activists, citizens and celebrities called for criminal charges before Frey did. But Floyd's family and the community may have to wait months, if not years, before investigations are complete.Floyd family attorney Benjamin Crump, a prominent civil rights lawyer, called for peaceful protests.“We cannot sink to the level of our oppressors, and we must not endanger others during this pandemic,” Crump said in a statement. “We will demand and ultimately force lasting change by shining a light on treatment that is horrific and unacceptable and by winning justice.”Police Chief Medaria Arradondo, who rose to the top job after his predecessor was forced out following the 2017 shooting of an unarmed white woman by a black Minneapolis officer, urged protesters to “be respectful.” He said he was working to change the department's culture.“One incident can significantly bring people to doubt that,” he said.The chief defended the department’s use of tear gas to break up Tuesday night’s protests, saying officers used it only after some people broke into a secure area that gave them access to squad cars and weapons. Video: Protester falls off police vehicle (warning: graphic)Bridgett Floyd told NBC's “Today” show that the officers involved in her brother's death should be charged with murder because “that’s exactly what they did.” She said she had not watched the video, but she told ABC's “Good Morning America” that she does not understand ""how someone could possibly let an individual go out like that.""The FBI and state law enforcement were investigating Floyd's death, which immediately drew comparisons to the case of Eric Garner, an unarmed black man who died in 2014 in New York after he was placed in a chokehold by police and pleaded for his life, saying he could not breathe.In the Garner case, local prosecutors, the NYPD’s internal affairs unit and the Justice Department all finished investigations into the case before the officer was ultimately fired. Garner’s family and activists spent years begging for the officer to be removed.The officers in the Minneapolis case have not been publicly identified, though one defense attorney has confirmed he is representing Chauvin. The attorney, Tom Kelly, declined to comment further.The police union asked the public to wait for the investigation to take its course and not to “rush to judgment and immediately condemn our officers.” Messages left with the union after the firings were not returned.During Tuesday's protests, some chanted and carried banners that read, “I can’t breathe” and “Jail killer KKKops.” Some stacked shopping carts to make a barricade at a Target store across the street from the station.News accounts show Chauvin was one of six officers who fired their weapons in the 2006 death of Wayne Reyes, who police said pointed a sawed-off shotgun at officers after stabbing two people. Chauvin also shot and wounded a man in 2008 during a struggle after Chauvin and his partner responded to a reported domestic assault. Police did not immediately respond to a request for Chauvin’s service record.In Minneapolis, kneeling on a suspect’s neck is allowed under the department’s use-of-force policy for officers who have received training in how to compress a neck without applying direct pressure to the airway. It is considered a “non-deadly force option,” according to the department’s policy handbook.Two use-of-force experts told The Associated Press that the officer clearly restrained the man too long, noting that the man was under control and no longer fighting. Andrew Scott, a former Boca Raton, Florida, police chief who now testifies as an expert witness in use-of-force cases, called Floyd’s death “a combination of not being trained properly or disregarding their training.”“He couldn’t move. He was telling them he couldn’t breathe, and they ignored him,” Scott said. “I can’t even describe it. It was difficult to watch.”Police said the man matched the description of a suspect in a forgery case at a grocery store, and that he resisted arrest.The video starts with the man on the ground, and does not show what happened in the moments prior. The unidentified officer is kneeling on his neck, ignoring his pleas. “Please, please, please, I can’t breathe. Please, man,” said Floyd, who has his face against the pavement.Floyd also moans. One of the officers tells him to “relax.” Floyd calls for his mother and says: “My stomach hurts, my neck hurts, everything hurts ... I can’t breathe.” As bystanders shout their concern, one officer says, “He’s talking, so he’s breathing.”The man slowly becomes motionless under the officer’s restraint. The officer does not remove his knee until the man is loaded onto a gurney by paramedics.Several witnesses had gathered on a nearby sidewalk, some recording the scene on their phones. The bystanders become increasingly agitated. One man yells repeatedly. “He’s not responsive right now!” Two witnesses, including one woman who said she was a Minneapolis firefighter, yell at the officers to check the man’s pulse. “Check his pulse right now and tell me what it is!” she said.At one point, an officer says: “Don’t do drugs, guys.” And one man yells, “Don’t do drugs, bro? What is that? What do you think this is?”Floyd had worked security for five years at a restaurant called Conga Latin Bistro and rented a home from the restaurant's owner, Jovanni Thunstrom.He was “a good friend, person and a good tenant,” the restaurateur told the Star Tribune. “He was family. His co-workers and friends loved him.”___Associated Press writers Gretchen Ehlke in Milwaukee and Todd Richmond in Madison, Wisconsin, and Hearst TV contributed to this report.",0.0

His death, which occurred Monday night after a struggle with police officers, was under investigation by the FBI and state agents. Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo, speaking to reporters Tuesday morning, was asked about the use of the knee on the man’s neck during the arrest. “We clearly have policies in place regarding placing someone under control,” Arradondo said, stating that taking a look at what happened and how those policies apply “will be part of the full investigation we’ll do internally.” Officers were called about 8 p.m. Monday to investigate a report of a forgery at a business, according to police spokesman John Elder. Police found the man, believed to be in his 40s, matching the suspect’s description in his car. “He was ordered to step from his car. After he got out, he physically resisted officers,” Elder said in a statement. “Officers were able to get the suspect into handcuffs and noted he appeared to be suffering medical distress.” The man, who was not identified, was taken by ambulance to Hennepin County Medical Center where he died a short time later, police said. The name of the officer seen kneeling on his neck wasn’t immediately released. The Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension has joined the FBI in its investigation. All body camera footage has been turned over to the BCA, which investigates most police shootings and in-custody deaths. The officers involved have been put on paid administrative leave, per department protocol. Nekima Levy-Armstrong, a prominent local activist, said watching the footage that was shared on social media made her “sick to her stomach” and she said it’s another example of police brutality toward African American men, the Star Tribune reported. “Whatever the man may have done should not have ended in a death sentence,” she said. “What started as an alleged economic incident once again turned deadly for a black man.” Levy-Armstrong said it reminded her of the Eric Garner case. He was an unarmed New York man who died in 2014 after he was placed in a chokehold by police and pleaded for his life saying he couldn’t breathe. A grand jury later decided against indicting the officers involved, sparking protests around the country. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey on Tuesday morning urged those who might protest to take precautions amid the coronavirus outbreak. He said there is a “need to make sure everyone voicing their opinion is staying safe,” and he asked potential protesters to practice social distancing. “If you’re sad, I get it, if you’re angry, that makes complete sense, if you feel the need to protest, of course, we want to make sure people are able to express themselves,” Frey said. “There is another danger out there right now, which is COVID-19.” Police in Minneapolis have come under scrutiny in recent years for deadly run-ins with citizens. A 24-year-old black man, Jamar Clark, was shot in the head and died in 2015 after a confrontation with two white officers responding to a reported assault. A county prosecutor declined to prosecute the officers, saying Clark was struggling for one of the officers’ gun when he was shot. A white woman, Justine Rusczcyk Damond, died in 2017 when she was shot in the stomach by a Minneapolis officer responding to her 911 call. That officer, who is black, was convicted of manslaughter and murder and is serving a 12-year prison sentence.",0.0

MINNEAPOLIS — The mayor of Minneapolis called Wednesday for criminal charges against the white police officer seen on video kneeling against the neck of a handcuffed black man who complained that he could not breathe and died in police custody. Based on the video, Mayor Jacob Frey said officer Derek Chauvin should be charged in the death of George Floyd. The footage recorded by a bystander shows Chauvin with his knee on Floyd’s neck as Floyd gasps for breath on the ground with his face against the pavement. The officer does not move for at least eight minutes, even after Floyd stops speaking and moving. “I’ve wrestled with, more than anything else over the last 36 hours, one fundamental question: Why is the man who killed George Floyd not in jail?” said Frey, who is white. ADVERTISEMENTSkip ................................................................ He later added: “I saw no threat. I saw nothing that would signal that this kind of force was necessary.” The day after Floyd died, Chauvin and three other officers were fired — an act that did not stem the flood of anger that followed the widely seen video shot on Memorial Day outside a convenience store. Protesters marched more than 2 miles Tuesday to the police precinct in that part of the city, with some damaging property and skirmishing with officers in riot gear who fired tear gas. Conflict erupted again Wednesday at the same precinct, with some protesters throwing rocks and bottles at police. News helicopter video appeared to show looting of nearby stores, including a Target, a Cub Foods and an auto parts store, with no evident police intervention. Another demonstration unfolded on the street outside Chauvin’s suburban home. An officer told protesters that Chauvin was not there.

The chief defended the department’s use of tear gas to break up Tuesday night’s protests, saying officers used it only after some people broke into a secure area that gave them access to squad cars and weapons. Gov. Tim Walz and Minnesota’s two top law enforcement officials — Attorney General Keith Ellison and Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington, both black — promised a thorough, transparent investigation. But Walz and Ellison didn’t endorse the mayor’s call to immediately charge the officer, saying the legal process needs to play out. “I understand the emotions are running high, and I think it’s important for the mayor to channel the emotion of the people who he represents. But I think it is critical that we adhere very closely to the facts and the law and the normal process,” Ellison said. The Hennepin County Attorney’s Office, which would prosecute any state charges, issued a statement saying that Floyd’s death had “outraged us and people across the country” and that the case “deserves the best we can give.” The FBI was investigating whether officers willfully deprived Floyd of his civil rights. Floyd’s death and that of Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia have reopened the divide between minority communities and police that grew to a national uproar following the 2014 killings of Eric Garner and Michael Brown, the 2015 killing of Freddie Gray and others. Speaking to reporters at Cape Canaveral, Florida, President Donald Trump called the death in Minneapolis “a very, very sad event” and said his administration was going to “look at it.” Later, he tweeted that he had asked for the federal investigation be expedited. ADVERTISEMENTSkip ................................................................ Democrat Joe Biden said Floyd’s death was “part of an ingrained, systemic cycle of injustice that still exists in this country” and “cuts at the very heart of our sacred belief that all Americans are equal in rights.” It also “sends a very clear message to the black community and black lives that are under threat every single day,” Biden added, saying he was glad the mayor and the police department fired the officers, “but I don’t think that’s enough.” A 2017 Pew Research Center study found that police think the public does not understand the risks they face. A more recent study from September showed police were considered more trustworthy than Congress, but only 33% of black adults and half of Hispanics say they believe officers treat racial and ethnic groups equally. Shocking videos of black men dying continue to emerge during the pandemic, which is hitting communities of color harder than white communities. Floyd himself had been laid off from his nightclub security job in the pandemic, a friend told the AP. Police say Floyd matched the description of someone who tried to pay with a counterfeit bill at the convenience store. It was unclear why Floyd was arrested in such a physical way for what would have been a low-level crime. Police in most large cities have backed away from certain arrests to guard against further spread of the virus. The officers in the video were not wearing masks. A Minneapolis Fire Department report shows that paramedics moved Floyd from the scene, and two fire crew members got into the ambulance to help. Medics were doing chest compressions and other lifesaving measures on an “unresponsive, pulseless male,” the report said. Floyd was pronounced dead at a hospital. An autopsy will be performed to determine if the neck compression led to his death. News accounts show Chauvin was one of six officers who fired their weapons in the 2006 death of Wayne Reyes, who police said pointed a sawed-off shotgun at officers after stabbing two people. Chauvin also shot and wounded a man in 2008 during a struggle after Chauvin and his partner responded to a reported domestic assault. Police did not immediately respond to a request for Chauvin’s service record. Chauvin’s attorney confirmed the officer’s identity on Tuesday. The department identified the other officers Wednesday as Thomas Lane, Tou Thao and J Alexander Kueng. In calling for charges, the mayor contrasted Floyd’s death with others involving police that turned on split-second decisions by officers. “We are not talking about a split-second decision that was made incorrectly,” Frey said. “There’s somewhere around 300 seconds in those five minutes — every one of which that officer could have turned back, every second of which he could have removed his knee from George Floyd’s neck.” ___ Long reported from Washington.

Democrats propose sweeping police overhaul; Trump criticizes WASHINGTON (AP) — Democrats in Congress proposed a far-reaching overhaul of police procedures and accountability Monday, a sweeping legislative response to the mass protests denouncing the deaths of black Americans in the hands of law enforcement. The political outlook is deeply uncertain for the legislation in a polarized election year. President Donald Trump is staking out a tough “law and order” approach in the face of the outpouring of demonstrations and demands to re-imagine policing in America. “We cannot settle for anything less than transformative structural change,” said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, drawing on the nation’s history of slavery. Before unveiling the package, House and Senate Democrats held a moment of silence at the Capitol’s Emancipation Hall, reading the names of George Floyd and many others killed during police interactions. They knelt for 8 minutes and 46 seconds — now a symbol of police brutality and violence — the length of time prosecutors say Floyd was pinned under a white police officer’s knee before he died. Trump, who met with law enforcement officials at the White House, characterized Democrats as having “gone CRAZY!” ___ A US recession began in February in the face of coronavirus WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. economy entered a recession in February as the coronavirus struck the nation, a group of economists declared Monday, ending the longest expansion on record. The economists said that employment, income and spending peaked in February and then fell sharply afterward as the viral outbreak shut down businesses across the country, marking the start of the downturn after nearly 11 full years of economic growth. A committee within the National Bureau of Economic Research, a private nonprofit group, determines when recessions begin and end. It broadly defines a recession as “a decline in economic activity that lasts more than a few months.” For that reason, the NBER typically waits longer before making a determination that the economy is in a downturn. In the previous recession, the committee did not declare that the economy was in recession until December 2008, a year after it had actually begun. But in this case, the NBER said the collapse in employment and incomes was so steep that it could much more quickly make a determination. “The unprecedented magnitude of the decline in employment and production, and its broad reach across the entire economy, warrants the designation of this episode as a recession, even if it turns out to be briefer than earlier contractions,” the NBER panel said. ___ Officer charged in Floyd’s death held on $1 million bail MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — A judge on Monday kept bail at $1 million for a former Minneapolis police officer charged with second-degree murder in George Floyd’s death. Derek Chauvin, 44, said little during an 11-minute hearing in which he appeared before Hennepin County Judge Jeannice M. Reding on closed-circuit television from the state’s maximum security prison in Oak Park Heights. He wore a mask and handcuffs as he sat at a table, where he answered yes or no to routine housekeeping questions and confirmed the the spelling of his name and address. He did not enter a plea; a step that usually comes later in Minnesota courts. A judge raised Chauvin’s bail from $500,000 to $1 million when a second-degree murder charge was added on Wednesday. Monday’s hearing was a chance for arguments over the higher bail. Prosecutor Matthew Frank argued for keeping the higher bail, saying the seriousness of the charges and the “strong reaction in the community, to put it mildly,” made Chauvin a flight risk. The judge agreed with the state’s request for $1.25 million unconditional bail, or $1 million with standard conditions including surrendering firearms, remaining law-abiding and making all future court appearances. Chauvin’s attorney, Eric Nelson, did not contest the bail amount and didn’t address the substance of the charges, which also include third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Nelson did not speak with reporters afterward. He has not commented on the case publicly since Chauvin’s May 29 arrest. ___ N. Korea says it will cut communication channels with South SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korea said it will cut off all communication channels with South Korea at noon Tuesday as it escalates its pressure on the South for failing to stop activists from floating anti-Pyongyang leaflets across their tense border. South Korea’s liberal government, which espouses greater ties with North Korea, repeated that it will work toward restoring peace on the Korean Peninsula in its response to the warning. Relations between the Koreas have been strained during a prolonged deadlock in broader nuclear diplomacy between Pyongyang and Washington. Some experts say North Korea may be deliberately creating tensions to bolster internal unity or launch a bigger provocation in the face of persistent U.S.-led sanctions. The North’s Korean Central News Agency said all cross-border communication lines will be cut off in “the first step of the determination to completely shut down all contact means with South Korea and get rid of unnecessary things.” It said the decision was made by Kim Yo Jong, the powerful sister of leader Kim Jong Un, and Kim Yong Chol, a former hard-line military intelligence chief who Seoul believes was behind two 2010 attacks that killed 50 South Koreans. ___ Thousands mourn George Floyd in Texas amid calls for reform HOUSTON (AP) — The last chance for the public to say goodbye to George Floyd drew thousands of mourners Monday to a church in Houston where he grew up, as his death two weeks ago continues to stoke protests in America and beyond over racial injustice, and spurred France to abruptly halt the use of police choke holds. Reflecting the weight of the moment, the service drew the families of black victims in other high-profile killings whose names have become seared in America’s conversation over race — among them Eric Garner, Michael Brown, Ahmaud Arbery and Trayvon Martin. “It just hurts,” said Philonise Floyd, George Floyd’s brother, sobbing as he ticked off some of their names outside The Fountain of Praise church. “We will get justice. We will get it. We will not let this door close.” Under a blazing Texas sun, mourners wearing T-shirts with Floyd’s picture or the words “I Can’t Breathe” — the phrase he said repeatedly while pinned down by a Minneapolis police officer — waited for hours to pay their respects as Floyd’s body, dressed in a brown suit, lay in an open gold-colored casket. Some sang “Lean on Me” and Houston’s police chief bumped fists and embraced others in line. Funeral home spokeswoman La’Torria Lemon said at least 6,000 attended the service. Some knew Floyd in the nearby housing projects where he grew up. Others traveled hours or drove in from other states. Those who couldn’t make it whipped up their own tributes: In Los Angeles, a funeral-style procession of cars inched through downtown as the viewing began in Houston. In Tennessee, residents of Memphis held a moment of silence. ___ Cristobal to merge with new storm system after lashing South Tropical Storm Cristobal could soon renew its strength by uniting with another storm system coming from the west to form one giant cyclone, forecasters say. After drenching much of the South, forecasters now expect the remnants of Cristobal to bring fierce winds, heavy rain and thunderstorms to much of the Midwest by Tuesday. A very strong storm system sweeping out from the Rocky Mountains is expected to meld with Cristobal in the next couple of days, said Greg Carbin, who oversees forecasts at the Weather Prediction Center in College Park, Maryland. “The two will eventually merge into a large cyclone,” Carbin said. “It’s a pretty fascinating interaction we’ll see over the next couple of days.” Wind gusts of up to 45 mph (72 kph) are expected in Chicago by Tuesday night, the National Weather Service said. Boaters were being warned of gale-force winds on nearby Lake Michigan on Tuesday and Wednesday. ___ Behind virus and protests: A chronic US economic racial gap WASHINGTON (AP) — The United States has been here before, staring into the deep chasm that divides white and black Americans. It happened after cities burned in 1967, after Los Angeles erupted with the 1992 acquittal of police officers who beat Rodney King, after the 2014 police killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. After those upheavals came talk of change — of reforming policing, yes, but also of expanding economic opportunity to black Americans who have been disproportionately left behind in one of the world’s richest countries. Yet despite big pledges and high hopes, economic progress has come slowly, if at all, for black America. African Americans still earn barely 60 cents for every $1 in white income. They have 10 cents in wealth for every $1 whites own. They remain more than twice as likely to live in poverty. And they’re about as likely to own a home as they were when Richard Nixon was president. Now, demonstrators are out in the streets again, this time to protest what happened in Minneapolis to George Floyd, dead after a police officer pressed a knee into his neck for eight minutes and 46 seconds. ___ Bonnie Pointer, early member of Pointer Sisters, dies at 69 LOS ANGELES (AP) — Bonnie Pointer, who in 1969 convinced three of her church-singing siblings to form the Pointer Sisters, which would become one of the biggest acts of the next two decades, died Monday. The Grammy winner died of cardiac arrest in Los Angeles, publicist Roger Neal said. She was 69. “It is with great sadness that I have to announce to the fans of the Pointer Sisters that my sister, Bonnie died this morning,” sister Anita Pointer said in a statement. “Our family is devastated, on behalf of my siblings and I and the entire Pointer family, we ask for your prayers at this time.” Bonnie Pointer often sang lead and was an essential member of the group through its early hits including “Yes We Can Can” and “Fairytale.” She would leave for a short and modest solo career in 1977 as her sisters went on to have several mega-hits without her. Ruth, Anita, Bonnie and June, born the daughters of a minister who also had two older sons, grew up singing in his church in Oakland, California. ___ MLB offers 76-game season, playoffs rise up to 16 teams NEW YORK (AP) — Major League Baseball has made another try to start the coronavirus-delayed season in early July, proposing a 76-game regular season, expanding the playoffs from 10 teams to as many as 16 and allowing players to earn about 75% of their prorated salaries. Players have refused cuts beyond what they agreed to in March shortly after the pandemic began, part of baseball’s again acrimonious labor relations. The arduous negotiations have jeopardized plans to hold opening day around the Fourth of July in empty ballparks and provide entertainment to a public still emerging from months of quarantine. MLB’s latest proposal would guarantee 50% of players’ prorated salaries over the regular season, according to details obtained by The Associated Press. The proposal would eliminate all free-agent compensation for the first time since the free-agent era started in 1976. It also would forgive 20% of the $170 million in salaries already advanced to players during April and May. “If the players desire to accept this proposal, we need to reach an agreement by Wednesday,” Deputy Commissioner Dan Halem wrote in a letter to union negotiator Bruce Meyer that was obtained by The Associated Press. “While we understand that it is a relatively short time frame, we cannot waste any additional days if we are to have sufficient time for players to travel to spring training, conduct COVID-19 testing and education, conduct a spring training of an appropriate length, and schedule a 76-game season that ends no later than Sept. 27.” ___ AP PHOTOS: Huge crowds worldwide in name of racial justice All weekend, the crowds did not let up. From New York to Paris to Sydney, thousands upon thousands of mostly peaceful protesters demanding an end to institutional racism took over plazas, avenues and squares around the world. In Australia, crowds of demonstrators in state capitals honored the memory of George Floyd, a handcuffed black man who was killed two weeks ago by a white police officer, and protested the deaths of indigenous Australians in custody. In the southern French city of Marseille, protesters held up signs that read, “kill, it is being filmed,” in a reference to Floyd’s last moments, which were caught on video, and “I’m not black but will fight for you.” And so in Rome, London, Barcelona, Berlin.",0.0

The pilot of that final shuttle mission was Doug Hurley, and he's aboard again Wednesday, ready to make history with the launch of SpaceX's Crew Dragon capsule. When Hurley and his crew cleared the tower aboard Atlantis on July 8, 2011, the future of human spaceflight from Florida was uncertain. Getting to space was going to require hitching a ride on Russia's Soyuz capsules lifting off from Kazakhstan. A U.S. replacement ride was at least four years away. In fact, budget cuts and technical challenges delayed NASA's Commercial Crew Program for almost a decade. The $6 billion program aims to launch astronauts to the International Space Station using commercial companies — SpaceX and Boeing. After the final shuttle mission, Hurley worked at NASA's Johnson Space Center to develop the Commercial Crew Program. In 2015, he was selected as one of the first Commercial Crew astronauts. Now he will once again fly to space — something that surprises even him. ""I certainly didn't expect to fly again,"" says Hurley, who also flew on the space shuttle Endeavour in 2009. ""I certainly didn't necessarily have a plan to fly again. And if I did, it would have had to have been a case where somebody would have wanted me to."" Hurley joined NASA in 2000 as part of an astronaut class that called themselves the Bugs, after the Y2K computer glitch of that year. He was selected for his test-flight skills and had clocked over 5,500 hours in more than two dozen military aircraft before joining the space agency. Terry Virts, a former test pilot-turned-astronaut who also joined NASA in 2000, says of Hurley: ""He's just solid. He's not going to make any mistakes."" Virts adds, ""He's going to stay cool no matter what happens. He's definitely a very good choice. I know why our bosses picked him for this job."" The focus of this flight, known as Demonstration Mission 2, will put Hurley's test pilot skills to use. He and co-pilot Bob Behnken are tasked with flying SpaceX's Crew Dragon for the first time. The duo will put the sleek capsule through its paces, flying it using a touch screen and iPads before it docks with the space station. The launch is set for 4:33 p.m. ET Wednesday, and the spacecraft will dock with the station about 18 hours later. The astronauts will spend anywhere from one to four months on the station. Like Hurley, Behnken, another Bug, is a veteran of two shuttle missions, one in 2008 and another two years later. He says Hurley is cool under pressure and dedicated to the mission. ""I always know that Doug is going to be one step ahead of me and ready for whatever's kind of coming in front of us,"" he says. ""He's going to be the one who's ready a second and a half before I am."" The mission is a critical test flight that will — if all goes well — pave the way for more astronauts to fly to the station from the United States. NASA is out of rides to the space station from Roscosmos, the Russian space agency, and Boeing, the second commercial partner, is facing delays getting its capsule certified for launch. Hurley and Behnken will spend 18 hours in space, testing and certifying all of the systems of the Crew Dragon — from flying it in orbit to sleeping on board to testing the spacecraft's toilet. ""You want to know that when it hits the fan, when things don't go as planned, that you have these people with you that will have your back, and that they know you'll have theirs,"" says fellow class of 2000 astronaut Nicole Stott, who is now retired from NASA. ""That's Doug,"" she says. ",0.0

The 25-year-old black man was shot and killed by two white men while he was out for a jog in February in Glynn County, Ga. When video of the incident was released, it was met with public outcry and protest. In the weeks since, we've seen more outrage accompany new headlines about African Americans killed by police. Dreasjon ""Sean"" Reed was shot and killed in Indianapolis. Breonna Taylor, an emergency medical technician in Louisville, Ky., was shot eight times in her bed. And Monday night Minneapolis, another black man died in police custody; a video shows George Floyd pleading with an officer whose shoe is on his neck.

While we await such a day, Let us say your name: Ahmaud Arbery, Ahmaud Arbery, Ahmaud Arbery. I am sorry that we all know your name now; That we will forget it far too soon. I am sorry that the only song they know to sing for you is tragedy. I am sorry that all I can do is write this poem I am sorry that your life has become a metaphor: a house being built, down the road, He liked to mark its progress, dream of building one himself, Eyes shine through windows, Like raccoons in the woods at night, Their faces twisted, pink, and hot, He knows these trees, and their strange fruit, Of thee I sing. after hatred's song is spilled out into the streets and across soft green lawns it cannot be unsung After bullet leaves chamber it cannot be recalled My heart rages for another mother's loss of her son for the blindness for the cover up for the tears not enough to wet the graves of so many lost for the sake of insanity: a black babysitter caring for white children a black professor opening his own front door a young black woman sleeping in her own college lounge a black teen knocking on a door to ask directions his first words: Don't Be Afraid a black boy jogging in the morning There is an essential difference between running and running for your life. I remember my mother, the night she got down on her hands and knees on the frayed rug, Tired of the facade of racial progress Pain too hard to bear, fists pumping out the beat, ""I can't take it anymore."" I don't fear the pick-up trucks It's only the dogs sometimes, when there are two or more, and mean, Who charge out onto the road, hair raised along their backs, barking and growling.

We fight to rise above this sin We fight to be a world of one We fight for our humanity because after leaves fall they cannot be reattached to the tree because broken hearts still beat because Justice peeks her head around the corner.

RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: And I'm joined by MORNING EDITION poet-in-residence Kwame Alexander. Hi, Kwame. KWAME ALEXANDER, BYLINE: Hey, Rachel. MARTIN: So last time you were here, Kwame, you and I encouraged our listeners to really look for the protective nature of poetry and to write a poem in response to the murder of Ahmaud Arbery. He is the black man who was chased down by two white men and killed last February when he was out jogging. ALEXANDER: I still struggle to grapple with what it means to be black and safe in America. Did you know that in the weeks following Arbery's death, three more African Americans were killed under police brutality? Sean Reed's death in Indianapolis, recorded live on social media. Breonna Taylor, an emergency medical technician in Louisville, was shot eight times in her bed. And just Monday night, Rachel, in south Minneapolis, another black man died in police custody. His name is George Floyd. There's video of him pleading with an officer, who's on his neck. We hear him crying out, I can't breathe. MARTIN: Which, of course, were the last words of Eric Garner, who was killed at the hands of police in New York in 2014. And it is an impossible reality to try to reconcile. How do we face our best selves when we are confronted with this truth that is unfathomable and unjust? ALEXANDER: I don't know. I recall a Toni Morrison quote. She said, ""This is precisely the time when artists go to work. There is no time for despair, no place for self-pity, no need for silence, no room for fear. We speak. We write. We do language."" MARTIN: The art that comes from hurt is a compelling force, right? It can be formidable. And you are doing your part in that with your poems. We got over a thousand entries from our listeners, an emotional outpouring of poems, reflections about America, America today. ALEXANDER: Look; I know I sound like a broken record here, but, wow, I was blown away with the heart, the anger, the angst and the hope in all of these submissions. MARTIN: So you took them and combined them into many words and one voice. ALEXANDER: Yeah. But, Rachel, our listeners, they write these muscular and moving poems and reflections. I'm just honored to be able to bring them together. So this is our crowdsource community poem ""Running For Your Life."" MARTIN: OK. ALEXANDER: What is the color of air? Who owns the right to breathe? Why are we so afraid of each other? When will they come for the brown men I know and love? What was his crime? MARTIN: Is there justice for all in the land of the free, or only those who are white like me? What is the vaccine for this pandemic? I wonder where my baby is. ALEXANDER: Another black body shot. White-hot hate left its stain on a blackened Georgia road. MARTIN: My country, tis of thee. We must raise the skeletons buried deep in our past. ALEXANDER: 1880, 1890, 1920, 1990, 2020 - give it time, white fragility says. Nothing moves forward until this hunting stops a knife on our collective tongues. MARTIN: Please stop running from the truth and listen. This death was everyone's fault. This is on you, young America. We must accept the lingering shame and guilt, the anger and mistrust inequality have instilled, apologize for the damage, commit to sow a future with humility.

MARTIN: I am sorry that the only song they know to sing for you is tragedy. I am sorry that all I can do is write this poem. I am sorry that your life has become a metaphor. ALEXANDER: My heart rages for another mother's loss of her son, for the blindness, for the cover-up, for the tears not enough to wet the graves of so many lost for the sake of insanity. MARTIN: A black babysitter caring for white children, a black professor opening his own front door, a young black woman sleeping in her own college lounge, a black teen knocking on a door to ask directions - his first words, don't be afraid - a black boy jogging in the morning. There is an essential difference between running and running for your life.

HONG KONG — Thousands of protesters shouted pro-democracy slogans and insults at police in Hong Kong on Wednesday as lawmakers debated a bill criminalizing abuse of the Chinese national anthem in the semi-autonomous city. Police massed outside the legislative building ahead of the session and warned protesters that if they did not disperse, they could be prosecuted. In the Central business district, police raised flags warning protesters to disperse before they shot pepper balls at the crowd and searched several people. More than 50 people in the Causeway Bay shopping district were rounded up and made to sit outside a shopping mall, while riot police with pepper spray patrolled and warned journalists to stop filming. ADVERTISEMENTSkip ................................................................ In the Mong Kok district in Kowloon, some protesters set cardboard boxes and plastic on fire as demonstrations carried on into the night. The blaze was put out by firefighters. Across Hong Kong, 360 people were arrested on charges including unauthorized assembly, possession of items that could be used for unlawful purposes — such as gasoline bombs — to driving slowly and blocking traffic, according to Facebook posts by the Hong Kong police force. The bill would make it illegal to insult or abuse the Chinese national anthem, “March of the Volunteers” in semi-autonomous Hong Kong. Those guilty of the offense would face up to three years in prison and a fine of 50,000 Hong Kong dollars ($6,450). Opponents of the bill say it is a blow to freedom of expression in the city, while Beijing officials say it will foster a patriotic spirit and socialist values. “Western democracies all have laws to protect their national flags, national anthems and emblems. Any insulting acts toward these symbols would also be criminal,” pro-Beijing lawmaker Tony Tse said in the legislative debate. Tse said the bill would not affect human rights or force people to love the country or support any political power. “The purpose of this is to protect the dignity of a country,” he said. Pro-democracy lawmaker Charles Mok disagreed, saying the legislation would not help gain the respect of people and was an excuse to control freedom, speech and ideas of people. “We oppose the second reading of the national anthem bill, not because we don’t respect the national anthem. The national anthem is a symbol of the country’s dignity. If it wants to be respected, then let this government first respect the rights and freedoms of its people first,” Mok said. ADVERTISEMENTSkip ................................................................ The debate over the anthem bill is expected to continue on Thursday. The bill was proposed in January 2019 after spectators from Hong Kong jeered at the anthem during high-profile international soccer matches in 2015. Last year, FIFA fined the Hong Kong Football Association after fans booed the national anthem at a World Cup qualifying game. Hong Kong was returned to China from British colonial rule in 1997 under a “one country, two systems” framework that promised freedoms not found on the mainland. Anti-China sentiment has risen as residents see Beijing moving to erode those rights. Mass protests in 2014, known as the Umbrella Revolution, followed the Chinese government’s decision to allow direct election of the city leader only after it screened candidates. In the end, the plan for direct elections was dropped. Legislation proposed in Hong Kong last year that would have allowed Hong Kong residents to be sent to mainland China for trials set off months of demonstrations that at times involved clashes between protesters and police. The legislation was withdrawn. China’s ceremonial parliament now meeting in Beijing has moved to enact a national security law for Hong Kong aimed at forbidding secessionist and subversive activity, as well as foreign interference and terrorism. Hong Kong’s own government has been unable to pass such legislation due to opposition in the city, and Beijing advanced the law itself after the protests last year. Asked about possible U.S. retaliation over the security legislation, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said in Beijing that China would take necessary steps to fight back against what he called “erroneous foreign interference in Hong Kong’s affairs.”",0.0

1618260171,2020-05-27 13:35:00,George Floyd's Death Stokes Call For Minneapolis Officers To Be Charged With Murder,https://www.krwg.org/post/george-floyds-death-stokes-call-minneapolis-officers-be-charged-murder,en,False,,214420,krwg.org,http://krwg.org/,"Updated at 2:20 p.m. ET Just one day after the death of a black man whose arrest was recorded and posted on social media by a passerby, Minneapolis is grappling with the fallout that has spread beyond city limits. The disturbing video of Monday night's death — during which a white officer's knee was planted firmly on George Floyd's neck and his desperate calls for help were ignored — has prompted protests in the Minnesota city and demands for charges for the officers involved. At a news conference Wednesday, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey called on Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman to ""act on the evidence before him"" and press charges on the arresting officer. ""Why is the man who killed George Floyd not in jail? If you had done it or I had done it, we would be behind bars right now. And I cannot come up with a good answer to that question,"" Frey told a news conference Wednesday. ""We watched for five whole excruciating minutes as a white officer firmly pressed his knee into the neck of an unarmed, handcuffed black man,"" he added, noting that the arresting officer was not practicing a technique condoned by the city's police. ""I saw no threat; I saw nothing that would signal that this kind of force was necessary."" Frey refrained from specifying what charges he would like to see, citing a desire not to impede investigators. But Floyd's sister Bridgett went one step further on national television earlier Wednesday. ""I would like for those officers to be charged with murder because that's exactly what they did,"" she told the Today show. ""They murdered my brother; he was crying for help."" She said the family, which has retained legal representation, is far from satisfied with the announcement that the four officers in the video have been fired — a swift decision that Frey said was ""the right call."" The Minneapolis Police Department has not publicly confirmed the officers' identities, and it said the FBI is also investigating the circumstances of Floyd's death. The announcement also failed to satisfy protesters who on Tuesday evening thronged to the department's 3rd Precinct, where clashes erupted between demonstrators and law enforcement in riot gear. As Minnesota Public Radio reported, the demonstrators damaged the building and a squad car in a confrontation that eventually saw police firing tear gas into the crowd. ""What we witnessed today was state-sponsored murder, a state-sponsored execution,"" Steven Belton, president of the nonprofit Urban League Twin Cities, said at a gathering of local civil rights leaders earlier Tuesday outside City Hall. ""And what we await to see is whether it's going to become state-sanctioned execution. It'll be sanctioned if nothing is done."" The controversy engulfing Minneapolis is not unfolding in a vacuum. Already a video recorded earlier this year in Georgia — depicting the death of an unarmed black man, who was followed and shot by two white men while out for a jog three months ago — has renewed questions about the conduct of local police, who did not arrest the men until after the video surfaced this month. And this week, a recorded encounter in New York City's Central Park caught fire after it was posted to social media. In the video, a white woman calls the police on a black man, who says he had simply asked her to leash her dog while he was out bird-watching. ""He's recording me and threatening me and my dog,"" she tells emergency operators multiple times as the man recording her keeps his distance. After the video surfaced, the woman was fired by her employer, the investment firm Franklin Templeton. The video recorded in Minneapolis more closely called to mind an earlier death in New York City, however. Like Eric Garner, who died after an officer's chokehold in 2014, Floyd's final words before he appeared to lose consciousness were a plea for help: ""I can't breathe."" Floyd is seen wailing the phrase several times with his face planted on the pavement, his hands apparently cuffed behind his back and a male officer kneeling on his neck. Observers standing nearby are heard telling officers that Floyd's nose was bleeding and that he was dying. The officer and his colleagues show little reaction as the man gradually goes silent. The officer does not lift his weight off Floyd's neck throughout most of the video until medical workers arrive to lift him into an ambulance on a stretcher. The New York City police officer who used the chokehold on Garner, Daniel Pantaleo, was never charged with a crime but was fired last year on a judge's recommendation. The Floyd family's attorney emphasized the link with Garner in comments Wednesday to the Today show. ""It's worse than Eric Garner in many ways,"" civil rights attorney Benjamin Crump said, ""because you hear the people even pleading with them, 'Please get your knee off his neck. Have some humanity; this is a human being,' "" U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota said in a statement Tuesday, ""There must be a complete and thorough outside investigation into what occurred, and those involved in this incident must be held accountable. Justice must be served for this man and his family, justice must be served for our community, and justice must be served for our country."" ",0.0

Like any politician, humans aren't the only ones in the middle of an election cycle. One small town in Vermont appoints a mayor of the four legged variety. Meet Lincoln, a Nubian goat and the first pet mayor of Fair Haven, Vermont, elected to office in 2019. Her campaign caused quite the international stir. I got a phone call from Paris. They wanted to know what was going on. And then this year we made the A rumor times in 2019 the first round of the Pet Mayor race. Just because I think it was the first time this was happening. Word spread, especially in France. They were very interested to know what was happening. What's going on? Why's there go being the mayor? Liz Strep, a a reporter for New Station My NBC five covered the goat mayors rise to political fame and her 2020 bid for re election. But don't worry, Fairhaven isn't actually taking executive orders from a goat. The idea electing an animal mayor really started because the school needed a new playground, their playgrounds. I think 30 years old, it's just really not safe. This slide has a big hole in it, and it's just going down. So as a fund raiser, Teoh get a new playground. They thought of this idea. You know, why don't you let a pet mayor and that will spark donations? That's really their only platform, that these candidates are running forest to raise money. So these animals really aren't making any major decisions in the town. They're really more of a mascot to encourage people to donate money to those students. A new playground Last year's election was pretty small. There were, I believe, three candidates. Lincoln ended up winning. She was a young, spunky little goat, very friendly. So I think that really helped her win that election. Lincoln's first days Mayer was very official, though politicians on four legs do come with their challenges. Last year, Lincoln was attending her swearing in ceremony. She had a little bit of an accident. She lost some for marbles. I guess you could say over things a little bit of a commotion there, but it was very entertained. She made her mark. You could say that wasn't one of her final. She, I guess, had a pretty successful first term, which is why she was seeking re election this year. The pet election turned out to be a huge hit both in and out of Fairhaven. So when the 2020 cycle began, competition was fierce because last year was such a big success. And there was so much publicity about Lincoln becoming the town's first pet mayor. A lot of students in the Fairhaven grade school wanted to nominate their own pets, so we had a bunny, a hamster old horse. I think there were five or six dogs. Five acts. There were 18 candidates. There were three main candidates that stood out to voters. Lincoln, the incumbent goat, Sammy, the police canine. And Murphy, the therapy dog. Lincoln at a very successful first term as mayor being an incumbent. A lot of people knew her name already that she was definitely a front runner. She raised. I think, about 1000 or so dollars for the playground, but the goal is $80,000. They really need to raise a lot more money. Murphy thinks reading is important for kids. He thinks having a safe place to play and be outside and get off their phones. This has important. Murphy, a therapy dog, volunteers at the Bear Even grade school, so students were already very familiar with Murphy and Spur. These owner also had several fund raisers during his campaign, though he raised about $500 before the actual town meeting day vote for the school's playground. We were amazed that we were able to raise that much. And then there, Sammy, but police canine Sammy was actually a rescue dog. All the kids were very from there with her, and they're always I wanted her to come in and pay a visit. Do you get to vote today? Welcome to the election stuff Surveying the voters at the polls. A lot of them were very interested in what the name of the animal waas, but also how cute they were. Why do you want to be the war? Said She's so you want 4 to 9 semi because he's true. Why did you want pizzazz? He's cute, and she likes the log on leashes out polling place on town meeting day. A few of the candidates were outside kind of doing a meet and greet with the kids, though I think that could have swayed some of the undecided voters if they had a good experience. He's feeling great. You got to greet all the kids coming to vote. So it was his day. Well, I think she's hungry. That's about yet She's been nibbling on the building. It's a different sort of a day for Everybody Loves Dogs. And then there's even a greater population of love. Police K Nights, Theo Day after a town meeting day, I was in the classroom with a bunch of eighth graders who are counting ballots, and we were there as the results came in. I won't Lincoln doing because I wanted Lincoln personally because he leaves a lot of money for the playground. Last year, I will say this. Eighth grade class WAAS Chris Stan's Class Kristan is Lincoln's owner, so they were a little biased. They really, really were pretty for Lincoln to win. It's my pleasure to announce the winner of the mayoral race fair in Vermont this year. There are a winner is Murphy the dog with 146 votes. When it was announced over the speaker that Murphy had one, there was a little bit of the side. They were a little disappointed, but it didn't take long for them to start cheering and applauding for Murphy. They were very excited that passing the torch on and it's a new year. I think they're looking forward to seeing what Murphy will do with his mayoral seat. I think Murphy will do a great job with the playground fun, so I really wanted him from that store sampling to win. Yeah, I asked him. He didn't care, but he's a new playground and an excuse to see adorable animals weren't the only benefits to the 2020 pet election. The kids were able to learn valuable lessons about exercising their voting rights. Your vote is your voice in the Democratic process. You have a lifetime of voting ahead of you, and I have to take that chance. Every opportunity you get. At the end of the day, this whole pet mayor raises to raise money for the playground, but also to really introduce kids to the importance of voting and taking election seriously, getting to the voting booth and making your voice heard. That's a right that we all have. You know, where U. S citizens and starting that process really early and getting Kate's excited about this process. That's really built goal of all of this. It doesn't matter who wins the playground, the kids, that's what it's about. They haven't reached their goal yet for the playground, but they're really helping that. Murphy can pulls through and get a lot of donations during his time as mayor. And, of course, we had to know. Will this small Vermont town ever hand over the mayoral office to a human? I don't think that there haven will have a human mayor anytime soon. Because Fairhaven has a human town manager, which is essentially sort of the same thing as a mayor. He makes a lot of the big decisions. He oversees that select board. So I think the town government is free, comfortable with just having a town manager. But I think they also really love having a pet mayor. If you'd like to donate to the Fairhaven Grade School Playground Fund, check out the link to the go Fund me in the description box. I'm Alexander Stone, and from everyone here it dispatches from the middle. Thanks for watching",0.0

Wochit FARMINGTON — When protesters gathered along East Main Street on May 21, one of them brought a New Mexico flag that had the Zia symbol altered and transformed into a Nazi symbol. This flag, along with the mass gathering of hundreds of people during a pandemic, led to outcry from many San Juan County residents. The May 21 protest was the second protest demanding that all businesses be allowed to reopen. During both protests, people compared New Mexico's response to the coronavirus to the measures implemented by Nazis in Germany during the holocaust. The protesters also compared Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham to Adolph Hitler. Buy Photo A protester on May 14 holds a sign comparing Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham to Adolph Hitler.

The organizers presented the petition to Farmington city officials and the San Juan County Sheriff’s Office on May 26, according to Claudia Anderson, who delivered the petition. ""I found the demonstration last Thursday to be unlawful and highly detrimental to Farmington,"" Anderson said, explaining that it violated public health orders. The public health orders include prohibiting gatherings of more than five people and requiring six-foot social distancing. The protest attracted between 500 and 1,000 people, many of whom did not wear masks or social distance. ""They managed in one fell swoop to violate every single order,"" she said.

Anderson said she hopes the petition leads to the creation of a bipartisan working group to ""lay a path forward.' ""If the open up crowd wasn't so anti-mask, it would help,"" she said. ""If my crowd wasn't so, 'keep it shut down until our numbers drop,' maybe that would help. The compromise would be if everybody would follow the CDC guidelines for mask wearing and social distancing in public places, we probably could open up a little further."" In a phone conversation on May 27, Mayor Nate Duckett said the San Juan County Office of Emergency Management is a nonpartisan group that meets every week to discuss the pandemic and local response to the virus. The San Juan County Office of Emergency Management posts regular updates to its Facebook page, which Duckett encourages residents to follow. Another petition was also started on Change.org around the same time in support of Mayor Nate Duckett and Sheriff Shane Ferrari, who were targeted in the other petition. By 11:30 a.m. May 27, it had 1,344 signatures. Ferrari attended the rally Ferrari was one of the elected officials present at the rally and a picture circulating on social media depicts him in uniform. The man holding the flag with the Nazi symbol can be seen in the background. Ferrari said in an email to The Daily Times that he is aware of the petition and, because it is an internet petition, many of the signatures are not from San Juan County residents. Since the rally, Ferrari said he has been answering questions via social media, email and phone. These questions have come from concerned residents, and he said he will continue to answer those questions.

Because of that duty, he declined to comment on how the man holding the flag was exercising his rights. ""Moving forward, I would ask for citizens to remember we are part of a diverse community and we are all struggling through health, economic and lifestyle changes,"" he said.

Farmington mayor says permit wasn't required to protest Farmington elected leaders addressed some of the concerns highlighted in the petition during the City Council meeting on May 26, which was recorded and can be viewed on the city’s website, fmtn.org. Duckett said the protesters did not apply for a permit for either the May 14 or May 21 rally. He said the city consulted with its attorney as well as the police chief and determined that city ordinances did not require the group to apply for a permit.

(Photo: Hannah Grover/The Daily Times) Duckett: 'That symbol has been used by individuals who are intolerant' Duckett stressed that he could not speak for the man who brought the flag, but he does not condone the use of hate symbols. “I know that this symbol has been used for other things throughout time, but I think all of us can identify, at least in the most recent history, that that symbol has been used by individuals who are intolerant,” he said. Councilor Linda Rodgers (Photo: ) Later, he told The Daily Times that ""there's no place for the use of that symbol in our community"" and that he doesn't want to ever see it used again. Councilor Linda Rodgers said she was among the many people offended by the flag. “It’s offensive, plain and simple,” she said. Rodgers said she supports the right to peacefully protest, however she added that hate and racism do not have a place in Farmington. County Commissioner Jim Crowley, who had attended at least one of the rallies, also condemned the use of the symbol. ""I completely condemn the use of Nazi symbolism,"" he said in an email. ""The use of this symbol has totally overshadowed the true meaning of this event, which was to support our local businesses. Those gathered, did so to support the need for businesses to reopen and effectively save the economy of our county."" City leaders speak out against political polarization of pandemic Rodgers also addressed the petition’s concerns with the way Farmington has handled the pandemic. She said city officials have been doing their best in a situation that none of them could have prepared for. “There’s not a book that we can go to and look for information,” she said. Buy Photo Janis Jakino (Photo: Jon Austria/The Daily Times) Councilor Janis Jakino said she does not condone the political polarization that has occurred during the pandemic and she encouraged protesters to exercise better judgment. “We’re all coping with this predicament in our own way and some better than others,” she said. Duckett agreed with Jakino about the polarization. ""We will make it through this and we'll be stronger in the end of it and we will learn some stuff that we never thought we would ever learn in our lives,"" Duckett said. ""We can do that humanely and we can do that civilly and it doesn't need to be anything that is divisive and politicized."" He said the politicization has been disturbing, including turning wearing or not wearing a mask into a political statement. CLOSE Bloomfield Senior Center is continuously making face masks for the public to help combat the COVID-19 pandemic. The demand is high and non-stop. Wochit ""I encourage people to do what they need to do for their health and the health of those around them,"" Duckett said. ""I think that's the social contract that all of us need to consider right now as we move forward."" He said that there is a “social contract all of us need to consider right now.” Duckett encouraged residents to follow the public health orders and take the steps needed to reduce the spread of the coronavirus so that the businesses can reopen. He said the City Council is concerned about the economic crisis resulting from the pandemic and supports allowing businesses to reopen at 20% capacity, which he said is appropriate and just. ""We all agreed on that with the idea that individuals can shop small businesses in the same safe manner as they shop these big stores,"" he said during the City Council meeting. On May 27, he said businesses in Farmington, San Juan County and across the nation will need to implement visible measures to reduce the spread of coronavirus in order for people to feel comfortable shopping there. Duckett said he is receiving emails from people concerned about the lack of those measures at local businesses. Nate Duckett (Photo: Photo by city of Farmington) Duckett commended the grocery store Albertsons for its efforts. He said when he shops there he has observed all employees wearing masks and the store has plexiglass shields and is wiping down all the carts and baskets in between uses. Ultimately, Duckett said everyone has the same goal — ""to get back to our lives in a safe and productive manner."" ""We're all going to have to do something to get there,"" he said. He encouraged people to wear masks, but also said there are people who, for health reasons, cannot wear masks. Duckett said people need to be gracious and not judge those who are not wearing a mask.

Some pulled an American flag from a nearby building and threw it into the blaze. Others added branches pulled from trees. A cinder block structure, on the north side of the park, that had bathrooms and a maintenance office, was engulfed in flames.Several miles north, a separate protest broke out in Northwest D.C., near the Maryland border. The Metropolitan Police Department says there were break-ins at a Target and a shopping center that houses Neiman Marcus, Saks Fifth Avenue Men’s Store, T.J. Maxx, a movie theater and specialty stores.

An Associated Press photographer saw police then begin firing many 40 millimeter canisters of tear gas toward the crowd. People were choking, gasping and some throwing up as they scattered, leaving only a few still in the streets.As police and National Guard troops took up positions with plastic shields on major streets, crowds melted away. WSB-TV showed footage about an hour later of officers taking people who lingered in the streets into custody, using plastic ties to handcuff them on street corners. 10:05 p.m. ETBIRMINGHAM - People have damaged a confederate monument in Birmingham, Alabama.

Police said they were investigating Wednesday night’s death as a homicide and had a suspect in custody, but were still investigating what led to the shooting. Protesters began gathering in the early afternoon near the city’s 3rd Precinct station, in the southern part of the city where 46-year-old George Floyd died on Memorial Day after an officer knelt on his neck until he became unresponsive. News helicopter footage showed protesters milling in streets near the city’s 3rd Precinct station, with some running in and out of nearby stores. A Target, a Cub Foods, a Dollar Tree and an auto parts store all showed signs of damage and looting. As darkness fell, fire erupted in the auto parts store, and city fire crews rushed to control it. Protesters set other fires in the street. Officers could be seen surrounding the nearby precinct, not attempting to intervene in the looting. Multiple fires burned early Thursday at buildings and smoke hung over the city. Fire crews worked to put out flames. Blocks of buildings with broken-out windows and other damage from looting were seen, and KSTP-TV reported that some people were seen going through buildings. Police spokesman John Elder said officers responding to a reported stabbing near the protests found a man lying on the sidewalk with what turned out to be a bullet wound. The man was pronounced dead at a local hospital. Elder said a suspect was in custody but said the facts leading up to the shooting were “still being sorted out.” It was the second night of violent protest since the death of Floyd, whom police were seeking to arrest outside a Minneapolis grocery store on a report of a counterfeit bill being passed. A bystander’s cellphone video showed an officer kneeling on Floyd ‘s neck for almost eight minutes as he eventually became unresponsive. Mayor Jacob Frey tweetedfor calm early Thursday. “Please, Minneapolis, we cannot let tragedy beget more tragedy,” he said on Twitter. He also asked for the public’s help in keeping the peace. The officer and three others were fired Tuesday, and on Wednesday, Frey called for him to be criminally charged. Protesters also gathered Wednesday evening at the officer’s suburban home as well as the Minneapolis home of Mike Freeman, the Hennepin County prosecutor who would make a charging decision in the case. No violence was reported in those protests. As the protests stretched into the evening, Police Chief Medaria Arradondo urged calm. In an interview with KMSP-TV, he noted the internal investigation as well as the FBI’s investigation of Floyd’s death and said they offer a chance at justice. “Justice historically has never come to fruition through some of the acts we’re seeing tonight, whether it’s the looting, the damage to property or other things,” he said. Elder said officers from St. Paul, Metro Transit and the state patrol were helping police the area. In California, hundreds of people protesting Floyd’s death blocked a Los Angeles freeway and shattered windows of California Highway Patrol cruisers on Wednesday.",0.0

1619025186,2020-05-28 09:37:27,Mayor: Officer who put knee on man’s neck should be charged,https://www.krqe.com/news/national/mayor-officer-who-put-knee-on-mans-neck-should-be-charged/,en,True,,662160,KRQE,https://www.krqe.com/,"MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — The mayor of Minneapolis called Wednesday for criminal charges against the white police officer seen on video kneeling against the neck of a handcuffed black man who complained that he could not breathe and died in police custody. Based on the video, Mayor Jacob Frey said officer Derek Chauvin should be charged in the death of George Floyd. The footage recorded by a bystander shows Chauvin with his knee on Floyd’s neck as Floyd gasps for breath on the ground with his face against the pavement. The officer does not move for at least eight minutes, even after Floyd stops speaking and moving. “I’ve wrestled with, more than anything else over the last 36 hours, one fundamental question: Why is the man who killed George Floyd not in jail?” said Frey, who is white. He later added: “I saw no threat. I saw nothing that would signal that this kind of force was necessary.” The day after Floyd died, Chauvin and three other officers were fired — an act that did not stem the flood of anger that followed the widely seen video shot on Memorial Day outside a convenience store. Protesters marched more than 2 miles Tuesday to the police precinct in that part of the city, with some damaging property and skirmishing with officers in riot gear who fired tear gas. Conflict erupted again Wednesday at the same precinct, with some protesters throwing rocks and bottles at police. News helicopter video appeared to show looting of nearby stores, including a Target, a Cub Foods and an auto parts store, with no evident police intervention. Another demonstration unfolded on the street outside Chauvin’s suburban home. An officer told protesters that Chauvin was not there. Red cans of paint were earlier spilled on his driveway, and someone wrote “murderer” in chalk at the end of his driveway. No one answered when an Associated Press reporter knocked on the door. Many activists, citizens and celebrities called for criminal charges before Frey did. But Floyd’s family and the community may have to wait months, if not years, before investigations are complete. Floyd family attorney Benjamin Crump, a prominent civil rights lawyer, called for peaceful protests. “We cannot sink to the level of our oppressors, and we must not endanger others during this pandemic,” Crump said in a statement. “We will demand and ultimately force lasting change by shining a light on treatment that is horrific and unacceptable and by winning justice.” Police Chief Medaria Arradondo, who rose to the top job after his predecessor was forced out following the 2017 shooting of an unarmed white woman by a black Minneapolis officer, urged protesters to “be respectful.” He said he was working to change the department’s culture. “One incident can significantly bring people to doubt that,” he said. The chief defended the department’s use of tear gas to break up Tuesday night’s protests, saying officers used it only after some people broke into a secure area that gave them access to squad cars and weapons. Gov. Tim Walz and Minnesota’s two top law enforcement officials — Attorney General Keith Ellison and Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington, both black — promised a thorough, transparent investigation. But Walz and Ellison didn’t endorse the mayor’s call to immediately charge the officer, saying the legal process needs to play out. “I understand the emotions are running high, and I think it’s important for the mayor to channel the emotion of the people who he represents. But I think it is critical that we adhere very closely to the facts and the law and the normal process,” Ellison said. The Hennepin County Attorney’s Office, which would prosecute any state charges, issued a statement saying that Floyd’s death had “outraged us and people across the country” and that the case “deserves the best we can give.” The FBI was investigating whether officers willfully deprived Floyd of his civil rights. Floyd’s death and that of Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia have reopened the divide between minority communities and police that grew to a national uproar following the 2014 killings of Eric Garner and Michael Brown, the 2015 killing of Freddie Gray and others. Speaking to reporters at Cape Canaveral, Florida, President Donald Trump called the death in Minneapolis “a very, very sad event” and said his administration was going to “look at it.” Later, he tweeted that he had asked for the federal investigation be expedited. Democrat Joe Biden said Floyd’s death was “part of an ingrained, systemic cycle of injustice that still exists in this country” and “cuts at the very heart of our sacred belief that all Americans are equal in rights.” It also “sends a very clear message to the black community and black lives that are under threat every single day,” Biden added, saying he was glad the mayor and the police department fired the officers, “but I don’t think that’s enough.” A 2017 Pew Research Center study found that police think the public does not understand the risks they face. A more recent study from September showed police were considered more trustworthy than Congress, but only 33% of black adults and half of Hispanics say they believe officers treat racial and ethnic groups equally.

Based on the video, Mayor Jacob Frey said officer Derek Chauvin should be charged in the death of George Floyd. The footage recorded by a bystander shows Chauvin with his knee on Floyd’s neck as Floyd gasps for breath on the ground with his face against the pavement. The officer does not move for at least eight minutes, even after Floyd stops speaking and moving. “I’ve wrestled with, more than anything else over the last 36 hours, one fundamental question: Why is the man who killed George Floyd not in jail?” said Frey, who is white. He later added: “I saw no threat. I saw nothing that would signal that this kind of force was necessary.” The day after Floyd died, Chauvin and three other officers were fired — an act that did not stem the flood of anger that followed the widely seen video shot on Memorial Day outside a convenience store. Protesters marched more than 2 miles Tuesday to the police precinct in that part of the city, with some damaging property and skirmishing with officers in riot gear who fired tear gas. Conflict erupted again Wednesday at the same precinct, with some protesters throwing rocks and bottles at police. News helicopter video appeared to show looting of nearby stores, including a Target, a Cub Foods and an auto parts store, with no evident police intervention. Another demonstration unfolded on the street outside Chauvin’s suburban home. An officer told protesters that Chauvin was not there. Red cans of paint were earlier spilled on his driveway, and someone wrote “murderer” in chalk at the end of his driveway. No one answered when an Associated Press reporter knocked on the door.

China’s ceremonial legislature, ending a one-week annual session curtailed because of the coronavirus, approved a decision by the ruling Communist Party to impose national security laws on Hong Kong. The body’s standing committee, a smaller group with decision-making power, is charged with developing the specific laws against secession, subversion, terrorism and foreign interference in Hong Kong’s affairs. No timetable has been announced, but they could be enacted at one of its next meetings in June and August. The move marks a definitive end to China’s more low-key approach to Hong Kong over the large-scale protests last year, said Cornell University China expert Allen Carlson. Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam, who has come under fire for her handling of the protests, said the decision was welcome because of the difficulty her government faces in passing national security legislation on its own. The city’s constitution requires it to enact such a law, but successive governments have been unable or unwilling to because of opposition. Lam said in a statement that new laws would “sanction an extremely small minority of criminals who threaten national security” and “not affect the legitimate rights and freedoms enjoyed by Hong Kong residents.” In a joint statement, top diplomats from the United States, U.K., Canada and Australia reiterated their “deep concern” regarding Beijing’s decision to impose a national security law in Hong Kong. Such a decision “would curtail the Hong Kong people’s liberties, and in doing so, dramatically erode Hong Kong’s autonomy and the system that made it so prosperous,” the statement said. One of the signatories, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, had notified Congress on Wednesday that the Trump administration no longer regards Hong Kong as autonomous from mainland China, setting the stage for the possible withdrawal of preferential trade and financial treatment that the U.S. gives to the former British colony. ADVERTISEMENTSkip ................................................................ Japan joined in the criticism of Beijing’s move. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said Japan is deeply concerned about the decision “amid strong concerns expressed by the international community and the people of Hong Kong.” German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said the European Union was in agreement that Hong Kong’s “high degree of autonomy cannot be undermined.” “Hong Kong’s citizens enjoy freedoms and rights that are guaranteed through the Basic Law and the ‘one country, two systems’ principle,” Maas said in a statement. “We expect these legal principles to be respected.” Pro-Beijing lawmakers said Hong Kong would retain its high degree of autonomy under the “one country, two systems” framework that has governed the territory since Britain returned it to China in 1997. “We truly believe that this decision made by the National People’s Congress would not harm the rights and freedom that Hong Kong people enjoy,” pro-Beijing lawmaker Martin Liao said. “It could solve the issue of violence and riot and let citizens return to a peaceful and stable life.” As China’s orderly 3,000-member Congress rubber-stamped the move in Beijing, Hong Kong’s legislature was taking on another bill that would criminalize insulting or abusing the Chinese national anthem in a raucous session in which three pro-democracy lawmakers were ejected and proceedings halted for about five hours. The legislature’s president, Andrew Leung, suspended the meeting shortly after it began and ejected Eddie Chu for holding up a sarcastic sign about a pro-Beijing lawmaker that read “Best Chairperson, Starry Lee.” A second pro-democracy lawmaker was thrown out for yelling after the meeting resumed, and then a third after rushing forward with a large plastic bottle in a cloth bag that spilled its brownish contents on the floor in front of the president’s raised dais. ADVERTISEMENTSkip ................................................................ “We have wanted to use any method to stop this national anthem law getting passed by this legislature, which is basically controlled by the Chinese Communist Party, because the law is just another way of putting pressure on Hong Kong people,” Chu said outside the chamber. He said the legislature’s president had objected to his placard calling Lee an “illegal chairperson” during Wednesday’s first day of debate, so he made a new one that called her the best chairperson instead. Lee was recently elected chair of a key committee that sent the anthem bill to the full legislature for consideration. Her election, which the pro-democracy opposition contends was illegal, ended a monthslong filibuster that had prevented the committee from acting on the bill and other legislation. After the meeting restarted, pro-democracy lawmaker Ray Chan started yelling, and Leung ordered him ejected, too. Then a rushing Ted Hui kicked the cloth bag toward the president’s dais after security officers grabbed him and it fell from his hands. Members left the chamber, security guards sprayed disinfectant and cleaning workers arrived to wipe the carpet. Then firefighters in full protective gear entered and appeared to take samples from the floor using swabs. The meeting didn’t resume until 4 p.m. Hui later described the contents as a rotten plant, and said he wanted Leung to feel and smell the rotting of “one country, two systems” and Hong Kong’s civilization. “I wanted him to taste it, unfortunately it (fell) on the ground because I was hit by security guards,” he said. As the action unfolded, Hong Kong activist Joshua Wong applauded Pompeo’s announcement in a separate news conference. Sanctions or the freezing of Hong Kong’s special economic status would “let Beijing know it is a must to completely withdraw and stop the implementation of the national security law,” said Wong, who rose to prominence as a student leader during pro-democracy demonstrations in 2014. Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said ahead of Pompeo’s announcement that China would take necessary steps to fight back against any “erroneous foreign interference in Hong Kong’s affairs.” — Moritsugu reported from Beijing.

DETROIT — A Michigan court on Thursday ordered a barber to close his shop and stop defying the state’s coronavirus restrictions, though he vowed to keep cutting hair. The Michigan appeals court overturned a decision by a Shiawassee County judge and directed him to sign an injunction sought by state regulators. Karl Manke, 77, said he’s not backing down. He told The Associated Press that he got the news while cutting someone’s hair and he doesn’t intend to comply with it. ADVERTISEMENTSkip ................................................................ “I could care less,” he said by phone from his shop in Owosso, about 70 miles northwest of Detroit. “If they want to put me in jail, put me in jail. … I will be governed — fair governing — but not ruled. This is a police state action.” Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has kept barbershops and hair salons closed for weeks, citing a high risk of virus transmission as stylists cut hair and people wait for their turn. “Uncontroverted evidence clearly revealed that COVID-19 is a highly communicable illness,” the appeals court said in a 2-1 decision. “Uncontroverted evidence revealed that COVID-19 is spread by infected persons showing no symptoms that could serve to warn others of the possibility of infection.” Manke’s attorney, David Kallman, later asked the Michigan Supreme Court to intervene. Manke reopened his shop on May 4, saying he needed to make money and declaring that the “government is not my mother.” He has been ticketed for violating Whitmer’s orders. Separate from the court case, he’s had his shop and barber’s licenses suspended. Nonetheless, customers have traveled from all over the state to get a haircut and endorse his defiance. Manke gave free haircuts last week during a protest at the state Capitol. Texas hair salon owner Shelley Luther, who was briefly jailed for opening her shop, appeared at a rally outside Manke’s business. Elsewhere in Michigan, state regulators inspected Ardor and Grit Salon in Holland, according to the Mackinac Center Legal Foundation. The owner, Sarah Huff, participated in the Capitol protest, and her shop has been open since May 15. “She needs to make a living and she believes she can do so safely,” attorney Patrick Wright said. In Springfield, Missouri, Great Clips salons were temporarily closed after receiving threatening messages. Two hairstylists who tested positive for the coronavirus might have exposed 140 clients to the illness. ___ Check out more of the AP’s coronavirus coverage at https://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak ___ Follow Ed White at https://twitter.com/edwhiteap",0.0

Violent protests over the death of the black man in police custody broke out in Minneapolis for a second straight night Wednesday, with protesters in a standoff with officers outside a police precinct and looting of nearby stores. (Carlos Gonzalez/Star Tribune via AP) MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Cheering protesters torched a Minneapolis police station Thursday that the department was forced to abandon as three days of violent protests spread to nearby St. Paul and angry demonstrations flared across the U.S over the death of George Floyd, a handcuffed black man who pleaded for air as a white police officer kneeled on his neck. A police spokesman confirmed late Thursday that staff had evacuated the 3rd Precinct station, the focus of many of the protests, “in the interest of the safety of our personnel” shortly after 10 p.m. Livestream video showed the protesters entering the building, where fire alarms blared and sprinklers ran as blazes were set. Protesters could be seen setting fire to a Minneapolis Police Department jacket and cheering. Late Thursday, President Donald Trump blasted the “total lack of leadership” in Minneapolis. “Just spoke to Governor Tim Walz and told him that the Military is with him all the way. Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts,” he said on Twitter. Protests first erupted Tuesday, a day after Floyd’s death in a confrontation with police captured on widely seen citizen video. On the video, Floyd can be seen pleading as Officer Derek Chauvin presses his knee against him. As minutes pass, Floyd slowly stops talking and moving. The 3rd Precinct covers the portion of south Minneapolis where Floyd was arrested. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz earlier Thursday activated the National Guard at the Minneapolis mayor’s request, but it wasn’t immediately clear when and where the Guard was being deployed, and none could be seen during protests in Minneapolis or St. Paul. The Guard tweeted minutes after the precinct burned that it had activated more than 500 soldiers across the metro area. The Guard said a “key objective” was to make sure fire departments could respond to calls, and said in a follow-up tweet it was “here with the Minneapolis Fire Department” to assist. But no move was made to put out the 3rd Precinct fire. Assistant Fire Chief Bryan Tyner said fire crews could not safely respond to fires at the precinct station and some surrounding buildings. Earlier Thursday, dozens of businesses across the Twin Cities boarded up their windows and doors in an effort to prevent looting, with Minneapolis-based Target announcing it was temporarily closing two dozen area stores. Minneapolis shut down nearly its entire light-rail system and all bus service through Sunday out of safety concerns. In St. Paul, clouds of smoke hung in the air as police armed with batons and wearing gas masks and body armor kept a watchful eye on protesters along one of the city’s main commercial corridors, where firefighters also sprayed water onto a series of small fires. At one point, officers stood in line in front of a Target, trying to keep out looters, who were also smashing windows of other businesses. Hundreds of demonstrators returned Thursday to the Minneapolis neighborhood at the center of the violence, where the nighttime scene veered between an angry protest and a street party. At one point, a band playing in a parking lot across from the 3rd Precinct broke into a punk version of Bob Marley’s “Redemption Song.” Nearby, demonstrators carried clothing mannequins from a looted Target and threw them onto a burning car. Later, a building fire erupted nearby. But elsewhere in Minneapolis, thousands of peaceful demonstrators marched through the streets calling for justice. Floyd’s death has deeply shaken Minneapolis and sparked protests in cities across the U.S. Local leaders have repeatedly urged demonstrators to avoid violence. “Please stay home. Please do not come here to protest. Please keep the focus on George Floyd, on advancing our movement and on preventing this from ever happening again,” tweeted St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter, who is black. Erika Atson, 20, was among thousands of people who gathered outside government offices in downtown Minneapolis, where organizers had called a peaceful protest. Many protesters wore masks because of the coronavirus pandemic, but there were few attempts at social distancing. Atson, who is black, described seeing her 14- and 11-year-old brothers tackled by Minneapolis police years ago because officers mistakenly presumed the boys had guns. She said she had been at “every single protest” since Floyd’s death and worried about raising children who could be vulnerable in police encounters. “We don’t want to be here fighting against anyone. We don’t want anyone to be hurt. We don’t want to cause any damages,” she said. “We just want the police officer to be held accountable.” The group marched peacefully for three hours before another confrontation with police broke out, though details were scarce. After calling in the Guard, Walz urged widespread changes in the wake of Floyd’s death. “It is time to rebuild. Rebuild the city, rebuild our justice system and rebuild the relationship between law enforcement and those they’re charged to protect,” Walz said. Much of the Minneapolis violence occurred in the Longfellow neighborhood, where protesters converged on the precinct station of the police who arrested Floyd. In a strip mall across the street from the 3rd Precinct station, the windows in nearly every business had been smashed, from the large Target department store at one end to the Planet Fitness gym at the other. Only the 24-hour laundromat appeared to have escaped unscathed. “WHY US?” demanded a large expanse of red graffiti scrawled on the wall of the Target. A Wendy’s restaurant across the street was charred almost beyond recognition. Among the casualties of the overnight fires: a six-story building under construction that was to provide nearly 200 apartments of affordable housing. “We’re burning our own neighborhood,” said a distraught Deona Brown, a 24-year-old woman standing with a friend outside the precinct station, where a small group of protesters were shouting at a dozen or so stone-faced police officers in riot gear. “This is where we live, where we shop, and they destroyed it.” No officers could be seen beyond the station. “What that cop did was wrong, but I’m scared now,” Brown said. Others in the crowd saw something different in the wreckage. Protesters destroyed property “because the system is broken,” said a young man who identified himself only by his nickname, Cash, and who said he had been in the streets during the violence. He dismissed the idea that the destruction would hurt residents of the largely black neighborhood. “They’re making money off of us,” he said angrily of the owners of the destroyed stores. He laughed when asked if he had joined in the looting or violence. “I didn’t break anything.” The protests that began Wednesday night and extended into Thursday were more violent than Tuesday’s, which included skirmishes between offices and protesters but no widespread property damage. Mayor Jacob Frey appealed for calm but the city’s response to the protests was quickly questioned as things started spiraling into violence. “If the strategy was to keep residents safe — it failed,” City Council Member Jeremiah Ellison, who is black, tweeted. “Prevent property damage — it failed.” On Thursday, he urged police to leave the scene of the overnight violence, saying their presence brings people into the streets. Protests have also spread to other U.S. cities. In New York City, protesters defied New York’s coronavirus prohibition on public gatherings Thursday, clashing with police, while demonstrators blocked traffic in downtown Denver. A day earlier, demonstrators had taken to the streets in Los Angeles and Memphis. In Louisville, Kentucky, police confirmed that at least seven people had been shot Thursday night as protesters demanded justice for Breonna Taylor, a black woman who was fatally shot by police in her home in March. Amid the violence in Minneapolis, a man was found fatally shot Wednesday night near a pawn shop, possibly by the owner, authorities said. Fire crews responded to about 30 intentionally set blazes, and multiple fire trucks were damaged by rocks and other projectiles, the fire department said. No one was hurt by the blazes. The city on Thursday released a transcript of the 911 call that brought police to the grocery store where Floyd was arrested. The caller described someone paying with a counterfeit bill, with workers rushing outside to find the man sitting on a van. The caller described the man as “awfully drunk and he’s not in control of himself.” Asked by the 911 operator whether the man was “under the influence of something,” the caller said: “Something like that, yes. He is not acting right.” Police said Floyd matched the caller’s description of the suspect. The U.S. Attorney’s Office and the FBI in Minneapolis said Thursday they were conducting “a robust criminal investigation” into the death. President Donald Trump has said he had asked an investigation to be expedited. The FBI is also investigating whether Floyd’s civil rights were violated. Chauvin, the officer who kneeled on Floyd’s neck, was fired Tuesday with three other officers involved in the arrest. The next day, the mayor called for Chauvin to be criminally charged. He also appealed for the activation of the National Guard. ___ Associated Press writers Steve Karnowski, Jeff Baenen and Doug Glass in Minneapolis, and Gretchen Ehlke in Milwaukee contributed to this report.",0.0

Many protesters wore masks because of the coronavirus pandemic, but there were few attempts at social distancing. Atson, who is black, described seeing her 14- and 11-year-old brothers tackled by Minneapolis police years ago because officers mistakenly presumed the boys had guns. She said she had been at “every single protest” since Floyd’s death and worried about raising children who could be vulnerable in police encounters. “We don’t want to be here fighting against anyone. We don’t want anyone to be hurt. We don’t want to cause any damages,” she said. “We just want the police officer to be held accountable.” The group marched peacefully for three hours before another confrontation with police broke out, though details were scarce. After calling in the Guard, Walz urged widespread changes in the wake of Floyd’s death. “It is time to rebuild. Rebuild the city, rebuild our justice system and rebuild the relationship between law enforcement and those they’re charged to protect,” Walz said. Much of the Minneapolis violence occurred in the Longfellow neighborhood, where protesters converged on the precinct station of the police who arrested Floyd. In a strip mall across the street from the 3rd Precinct station, the windows in nearly every business had been smashed, from the large Target department store at one end to the Planet Fitness gym at the other. Only the 24-hour laundromat appeared to have escaped unscathed. “WHY US?” demanded a large expanse of red graffiti scrawled on the wall of the Target. A Wendy’s restaurant across the street was charred almost beyond recognition. Among the casualties of the overnight fires: a six-story building under construction that was to provide nearly 200 apartments of affordable housing. “We’re burning our own neighborhood,” said a distraught Deona Brown, a 24-year-old woman standing with a friend outside the precinct station, where a small group of protesters were shouting at a dozen or so stone-faced police officers in riot gear. “This is where we live, where we shop, and they destroyed it.” No officers could be seen beyond the station. “What that cop did was wrong, but I’m scared now,” Brown said. Others in the crowd saw something different in the wreckage. Protesters destroyed property “because the system is broken,” said a young man who identified himself only by his nickname, Cash, and who said he had been in the streets during the violence. He dismissed the idea that the destruction would hurt residents of the largely black neighborhood. “They’re making money off of us,” he said angrily of the owners of the destroyed stores. He laughed when asked if he had joined in the looting or violence. “I didn’t break anything.” The protests that began Wednesday night and extended into Thursday were more violent than Tuesday’s, which included skirmishes between offices and protesters but no widespread property damage. Mayor Jacob Frey appealed for calm but the city’s response to the protests was quickly questioned as things started spiraling into violence. “If the strategy was to keep residents safe — it failed,” City Council Member Jeremiah Ellison, who is black, tweeted. “Prevent property damage — it failed.” On Thursday, he urged police to leave the scene of the overnight violence, saying their presence brings people into the streets. Protests have also spread to other U.S. cities. In New York City, protesters defied New York’s coronavirus prohibition on public gatherings Thursday, clashing with police, while demonstrators blocked traffic in downtown Denver. A day earlier, demonstrators had taken to the streets in Los Angeles and Memphis. In Louisville, Kentucky, police confirmed that at least seven people had been shot Thursday night as protesters demanded justice for Breonna Taylor, a black woman who was fatally shot by police in her home in March. Amid the violence in Minneapolis, a man was found fatally shot Wednesday night near a pawn shop, possibly by the owner, authorities said. Fire crews responded to about 30 intentionally set blazes, and multiple fire trucks were damaged by rocks and other projectiles, the fire department said. No one was hurt by the blazes. The city on Thursday released a transcript of the 911 call that brought police to the grocery store where Floyd was arrested. The caller described someone paying with a counterfeit bill, with workers rushing outside to find the man sitting on a van. The caller described the man as “awfully drunk and he’s not in control of himself.” Asked by the 911 operator whether the man was “under the influence of something,” the caller said: “Something like that, yes. He is not acting right.” Police said Floyd matched the caller’s description of the suspect. The U.S. Attorney’s Office and the FBI in Minneapolis said Thursday they were conducting “a robust criminal investigation” into the death. President Donald Trump has said he had asked an investigation to be expedited. The FBI is also investigating whether Floyd’s civil rights were violated. Chauvin, the officer who kneeled on Floyd’s neck, was fired Tuesday with three other officers involved in the arrest. The next day, the mayor called for Chauvin to be criminally charged. He also appealed for the activation of the National Guard. ___ Associated Press writers Steve Karnowski, Jeff Baenen and Doug Glass in Minneapolis, and Gretchen Ehlke in Milwaukee contributed to this report.",0.0

(AP Photo/Jim Mone) MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz called in the National Guard on Thursday as looting broke out in St. Paul and a wounded Minneapolis braced for more violence after rioting over the death of George Floyd, a handcuffed black man in police custody, reduced parts of one neighborhood to a smoking shambles. The Minneapolis unrest ravaged several blocks in the Longfellow neighborhood, with scattered rioting reaching for miles across the city. It was the second consecutive night of violent protests following the death of Floyd, who gasped for breath during a Monday arrest in which an officer kneeled on his neck for almost eight minutes. In footage recorded by a bystander, Floyd can be heard pleading that he can’t breathe until he slowly stops talking and moving. Another protest was announced for Thursday evening near county offices in downtown Minneapolis. Some stores in Minneapolis and the suburbs closed early, fearing more strife. The city shut down its light-rail system and planned to stop all bus service out of safety concerns. Around midday Thursday, the violence spread a few miles away to a Target in St. Paul’s Midway neighborhood, where police said 50 to 60 people rushed the store attempting to loot it. Police and state patrol squad cars later blocked the entrance, but the looting then shifted to shops along nearby University Avenue, one of St. Paul’s main commercial corridors, and other spots in the city. St. Paul spokesman Steve Linders said authorities have been dealing with unrest in roughly 20 different areas throughout the city. “Please stay home. Please do not come here to protest. Please keep the focus on George Floyd, on advancing our movement and on preventing this from ever happening again. We can all be in that fight together,” St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter tweeted. Walz called for widespread changes in the wake of Floyd’s death. “It is time to rebuild. Rebuild the city, rebuild our justice system, and rebuild the relationship between law enforcement and those they’re charged to protect. George Floyd’s death should lead to justice and systemic change, not more death and destruction,” Walz said.

Memphis police blocked a main thoroughfare after a racially mixed group of protesters gathered outside a police precinct.

No one was hurt by the blazes. There was no sign of police at the destroyed shopping center, though a couple dozen were outside the precinct house. One man standing outside the building was using a bullhorn to shout. “I can’t breathe, I can’t breathe. Mama, I can’t breathe,” repeating some of Floyd’s pleas for relief. Across from the precinct, someone had spray-painted the sidewalk in red: “Where’s humanity?” The 46-year-old Floyd died as police arrested him outside a convenience store after a report of a counterfeit bill being passed.

The most comparable situation to the current disturbances happened when the Guard was called up to deal with the riots in Minneapolis in 1967, a summer when anger over racial inequalities came to a boil in many cities across the country.

Over the past few days demonstrations in Minnesota have evolved from peaceful cries for justice into violence and destruction. Floyd's arrest and final minutes of his life were captured in multiple videos that are circulating widely on social media. In all versions, Floyd is pinned to the ground with his hands handcuffed behind his back. The knee of a police officer is crushing his neck, as another officer stands a few feet away. He is watching, seeming unfazed as the 46-year-old cries, ""I can't breathe."" Angry crowds have looted businesses and burned buildings. Meanwhile, law enforcement has met the civil disorder with clouds of tear gas. The unrest prompted Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz to activate the National Guard on Thursday to bring calm to the streets.

Protesters walked from the Capitol down the 16th Street pedestrian mall. (AP Photo/David Zalubowski) DENVER (AP) — Protesters swarmed Denver on Thursday, blocking traffic and smashing vehicles while running from gunfire and police tear gas after a demonstration against the death of a black man in Minneapolis police custody turned violent. Hundreds of demonstrators stood in the downtown streets and chanted as darkness fell outside the Colorado State Capitol, where protesters spray-painted graffiti and broke car windows. In other areas of downtown Denver, police in riot gear fired gas canisters, used rubber bullets and walked in a phalanx through the streets to drive protesters away. The protest briefly spilled over onto Interstate 25, blocking all lanes of traffic until police used tear gas to disperse the crowd. The protests continued into the night, despite Denver Mayor Michael Hancock pleading for calm. “I certainly understand everyone’s frustration and sense of pain and disgust following the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis,” he said in a video posted on Twitter. “But I want to plead to everyone. Let’s demonstrate, but let’s demonstrate peacefully. Leave the weapons home.” Earlier in the protest, gunfire outside the state Capitol sent people running for cover. Gary Cutler, a spokesman for the Colorado State Patrol, said the shots were fired in a park across the street. Most of the protesters already had left the area and were marching downtown. Cutler said the Capitol building was locked down, and everyone inside was safe. No injuries have been reported from the shots. State Rep. Leslie Herod, who was protesting at the Capitol, tweeted, “We just got shot at.” She later said, “We will not be deterred by this unspeakable act of violence.” Police spokesman Kurt Barnes said it’s unclear if the protesters were being targeted, and no one has been arrested. About six or seven shots were fired, he said. Several hundred protesters had gathered to call for justice following the death of Floyd, who died in police custody in Minneapolis on Monday after an officer knelt on his neck for almost eight minutes. In footage recorded by a bystander, Floyd pleaded that he couldn’t breathe. Some among the Denver protesters carried signs reading “Black Lives Matter” and chanted, “Hey, hey. Ho, ho. Racist police got to go.” Aerial footage showed several protesters smashing the windows out of at least two vehicles parked outside the Capitol, and others spray-painted graffiti on the Capitol steps. A cellphone video shot by protester Anabel Escobar, 29, showed a man on the hood of an SUV making its way through the crowd in front of the Capitol. The video showed the driver speeding up and then apparently trying to run the man over after he fell off the hood. The vehicle sped away as other protesters chased it. It was unclear if the man on the hood was injured. Gov. Jared Polis said Thursday night he was “absolutely shocked” by the video. “Coloradans are better than this,” he said. “I share the immense anguish we all feel about the unjust murder of George Floyd. But let me be clear, senseless violence will never be healed by more violence.” As the protest started, The Denver Police Department tweeted a message from Chief Paul Pazen sending condolences to Floyd’s family and saying the city’s officers do not use the tactics employed by the Minneapolis officers. He called that type of force “inexcusable.” Four Minneapolis police officers have been fired, and the mayor has called for the officer who knelt on Floyd’s neck to be criminally charged. The death has led to violent protests in Minneapolis and demonstrations in other cities, including Los Angeles.",0.0

(KRQE) – Albuquerque joins the nationwide outcry over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. During a press conference on Friday, the Albuquerque Police Department provided an update of the protests that took place Thursday night and what transpired. People were seen lining the streets near Central and Wyoming on Thursday night chanting, holding signs, many saying they’re just desperate for racial equality and they want to make sure their voices are heard. Protesters say they are frustrated after another African American was killed at the hands of a white police officer. After Floyd’s death earlier this week, they say they can’t wrap their head around how this keeps happening and they are tired of seeing these senseless deaths. Protesters also say they worry it could happen here. “People say black lives matter, people say blue lives matter. Yes you’re right, blue lives do matter, white lives matter, Asian lives matter, Native lives matter but in this point in time right now, black people’s lives are getting treated worse than animals and it’s time for it to stop,” said protester Damien Johnson. The Albuquerque Police Department was in the area of Central and Mesilla monitoring the protest. They report several shots were fired from a vehicle in the area of Wisconsin and Central and that four people were taken into custody. The Albuquerque Police Department held a press conference on Friday, to highlight what took place during the demonstrations. APD Police Chief Mike Geier stated that the protest started off peaceful with around 400 people gathering. Police report they were able to shut down Central from Wyoming to Louisiana so that residents could gather and have their voices heard. Deputy Chief Harold Medina thanked the initial group of individuals who participated in the peaceful demonstration. “I want to start by first thanking the first group of individuals that went out. This group of individuals went out and they peacefully demonstrated and they were a good example of what it means to be an American and exercise your first amendment right,” said Medina. A second group of individuals were in the area of Wyoming and Central around 9:30 p.m. and were causing a disturbance. Geier stated that a female sergeant was approached by individuals and her vehicle was damaged. “One of our female officers, a Sergeant, was driving in the area. A group surrounded her car, attacked the car. Actually broke the windows and caused some damage to the car,” said Geier. Several individuals were also seen on camera approaching vehicles and were attempting to drag civilians out of their cars and tried to damage their vehicles. Medina stated that one vehicle in particular was driving around firing shots. While it is unclear how many shots were fired by that specific vehicle, Medina says that the department used its new shot spotter technology to determine that there were about 33 total registered reports of shots fired in the area. Police say that the suspect vehicle drove to the area of Mesilla and Central where police attempted to initiate a traffic stop to take individuals into custody. One suspect fled the scene on foot but eventually returned and four people in total were taken into custody. While officers were trying to process the scene, a group of people started to cause problems for the officers. One individual allegedly took a baseball bat to several police vehicles, breaking the windows. “A group of individuals from the Wyoming area responded to where the officers were conducting the traffic stop, surrounded our officers, and began to commit criminal damage to some of our police vehicles,” said Medina. At that time, two Emergency Response Teams were called to the area to secure the scene and an armored vehicle was sent in to extract the individuals who were taken into custody. Medina states to prevent further escalation, police decided to leave the suspect vehicle at the scene. At this time, Medina explains the ERT teams were being confronted by the crowd and as the teams were told to fall back, the crowd would advance. The department used a helicopter spotlight to distract the crowd and buses were able to pick up officers. Medina states the crowd did attempt to follow the officers who were trying to exit the scene and gas was used to create distance between the officers and the crowd so that the officers were able to board the bus and leave the scene. The crowd dispersed shortly after. The four individuals who were arrested have since been released pending further investigation. Chief Geier made the following statement on behalf of the Albuquerque Police Department: The death of Mr. Floyd is deeply disturbing and should be of concern to everybody in our country. On behalf of our department and the city of Albuquerque, I would like to offer our sympathies and condolences to the Floyd family. Those officers’ actions are inconsistent with the training and protocols of our department. APD has worked tirelessly to build trust between law enforcement and the community we are sworn to protect. What occurred in Minneapolis is an unfortunate reminder of how quickly a death can undermine interest. The law enforcement profession must do better and hold ourselves to a higher standard. Our officers are trained to treat all individuals with dignity and respect. This is the essence of the principles of procedural justice. Like APD, most agencies today are taught to teach their officers to de-escalate critical situations and avoid the use of force if possible. We will not tolerate these actions and denounce this type of police brutality. The senseless misconduct demonstrated in this unfortunate incident should not define other police departments across the nation. APD denounces the behavior of the Minneapolis officers and we will continue to build the trust we’ve established in the community we proudly serve. “ APD Police Chief Mike Geier Related Coverage:",0.0

(AP Photo/David Zalubowski) DENVER (AP) — Protesters swarmed Denver on Thursday, blocking traffic and smashing vehicles while running from gunfire and police tear gas after a demonstration against the death of a black man in Minneapolis police custody turned violent. Hundreds of demonstrators stood in the downtown streets and chanted as darkness fell outside the Colorado State Capitol, where protesters spray-painted graffiti and broke car windows. In other areas of downtown Denver, police in riot gear fired gas canisters, used rubber bullets and walked in a phalanx through the streets to drive protesters away. The protest briefly spilled over onto Interstate 25, blocking all lanes of traffic until police used tear gas to disperse the crowd. The protests continued into the night, despite Denver Mayor Michael Hancock pleading for calm. “I certainly understand everyone’s frustration and sense of pain and disgust following the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis,” he said in a video posted on Twitter. “But I want to plead to everyone. Let’s demonstrate, but let’s demonstrate peacefully. Leave the weapons home.” Earlier in the protest, gunfire outside the state Capitol sent people running for cover. Gary Cutler, a spokesman for the Colorado State Patrol, said the shots were fired in a park across the street. Most of the protesters already had left the area and were marching downtown. Cutler said the Capitol building was locked down, and everyone inside was safe. No injuries have been reported from the shots. State Rep. Leslie Herod, who was protesting at the Capitol, tweeted, “We just got shot at.” She later said, “We will not be deterred by this unspeakable act of violence.” Police spokesman Kurt Barnes said it’s unclear if the protesters were being targeted, and no one has been arrested. About six or seven shots were fired, he said. Several hundred protesters had gathered to call for justice following the death of Floyd, who died in police custody in Minneapolis on Monday after an officer knelt on his neck for almost eight minutes. In footage recorded by a bystander, Floyd pleaded that he couldn’t breathe. Some among the Denver protesters carried signs reading “Black Lives Matter” and chanted, “Hey, hey. Ho, ho. Racist police got to go.” Aerial footage showed several protesters smashing the windows out of at least two vehicles parked outside the Capitol, and others spray-painted graffiti on the Capitol steps. A cellphone video shot by protester Anabel Escobar, 29, showed a man on the hood of an SUV making its way through the crowd in front of the Capitol. The video showed the driver speeding up and then apparently trying to run the man over after he fell off the hood. The vehicle sped away as other protesters chased it. It was unclear if the man on the hood was injured. Gov. Jared Polis said Thursday night he was “absolutely shocked” by the video. “Coloradans are better than this,” he said. “I share the immense anguish we all feel about the unjust murder of George Floyd. But let me be clear, senseless violence will never be healed by more violence.” As the protest started, The Denver Police Department tweeted a message from Chief Paul Pazen sending condolences to Floyd’s family and saying the city’s officers do not use the tactics employed by the Minneapolis officers. He called that type of force “inexcusable.” Four Minneapolis police officers have been fired, and the mayor has called for the officer who knelt on Floyd’s neck to be criminally charged. The death has led to violent protests in Minneapolis and demonstrations in other cities, including Los Angeles.",0.0
1619650230,2020-05-29 00:05:20,Demonstrators gather in northeast Albuquerque to protest George Floyd’s death,https://www.krqe.com/news/albuquerque-metro/demonstrators-gather-in-albuquerque-to-protest-george-floyds-death/,en,False,,96605,krqe.com,http://www.krqe.com/#spider,"Warning: Contains graphic language ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (KRQE) – Albuquerque joins the nationwide outcry over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. During a press conference on Friday, the Albuquerque Police Department provided an update of the protests that took place Thursday night and what transpired. People were seen lining the streets near Central and Wyoming on Thursday night chanting, holding signs, many saying they’re just desperate for racial equality and they want to make sure their voices are heard. Protesters say they are frustrated after another African American was killed at the hands of a white police officer. After Floyd’s death earlier this week, they say they can’t wrap their head around how this keeps happening and they are tired of seeing these senseless deaths. Protesters also say they worry it could happen here. “People say black lives matter, people say blue lives matter. Yes you’re right, blue lives do matter, white lives matter, Asian lives matter, Native lives matter but in this point in time right now, black people’s lives are getting treated worse than animals and it’s time for it to stop,” said protester Damien Johnson. The Albuquerque Police Department was in the area of Central and Mesilla monitoring the protest. They report several shots were fired from a vehicle in the area of Wisconsin and Central and that four people were taken into custody. The Albuquerque Police Department held a press conference on Friday, to highlight what took place during the demonstrations. APD Police Chief Mike Geier stated that the protest started off peaceful with around 400 people gathering. Police report they were able to shut down Central from Wyoming to Louisiana so that residents could gather and have their voices heard. Deputy Chief Harold Medina thanked the initial group of individuals who participated in the peaceful demonstration. “I want to start by first thanking the first group of individuals that went out. This group of individuals went out and they peacefully demonstrated and they were a good example of what it means to be an American and exercise your first amendment right,” said Medina. A second group of individuals were in the area of Wyoming and Central around 9:30 p.m. and were causing a disturbance. Geier stated that a female sergeant was approached by individuals and her vehicle was damaged. “One of our female officers, a Sergeant, was driving in the area. A group surrounded her car, attacked the car. Actually broke the windows and caused some damage to the car,” said Geier. Several individuals were also seen on camera approaching vehicles and were attempting to drag civilians out of their cars and tried to damage their vehicles. Medina stated that one vehicle in particular was driving around firing shots. While it is unclear how many shots were fired by that specific vehicle, Medina says that the department used its new shot spotter technology to determine that there were about 33 total registered reports of shots fired in the area. Police say that the suspect vehicle drove to the area of Mesilla and Central where police attempted to initiate a traffic stop to take individuals into custody. One suspect fled the scene on foot but eventually returned and four people in total were taken into custody. While officers were trying to process the scene, a group of people started to cause problems for the officers. One individual allegedly took a baseball bat to several police vehicles, breaking the windows. “A group of individuals from the Wyoming area responded to where the officers were conducting the traffic stop, surrounded our officers, and began to commit criminal damage to some of our police vehicles,” said Medina. At that time, two Emergency Response Teams were called to the area to secure the scene and an armored vehicle was sent in to extract the individuals who were taken into custody. Medina states to prevent further escalation, police decided to leave the suspect vehicle at the scene. At this time, Medina explains the ERT teams were being confronted by the crowd and as the teams were told to fall back, the crowd would advance. The department used a helicopter spotlight to distract the crowd and buses were able to pick up officers. Medina states the crowd did attempt to follow the officers who were trying to exit the scene and gas was used to create distance between the officers and the crowd so that the officers were able to board the bus and leave the scene. The crowd dispersed shortly after. The four individuals who were arrested have since been released pending further investigation.

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci) WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump spent Friday walking back his post-midnight “thugs” tweet about Minneapolis protesters that added to outrage over the police killing of a black man. Trump’s later repeated condemnation of the killing and outreach to the man’s family was a marked change in tone from his earlier comments that also invoked a civil-rights-era phrase fraught with racist overtones. “When the looting starts, the shooting starts,” Trump had written in a tweet that was quickly flagged by Twitter as violating rules against “glorifying violence.” Trump later said his comments had been misconstrued. “Frankly it means when there’s looting, people get shot and they die,” he said. Trump’s whiplash comments came after protesters torched a Minneapolis police station on Thursday night, capping three days of searing demonstrations over the death of George Floyd, who was captured on video pleading for air as a white police officer knelt on his neck for over eight minutes. And they underscored Trump’s complicated relationship with race as he tries to maintain a law-and-order mantle while looking to appeal to black voters during an election year. They also highlighted his refusal to avoid controversy or cede the spotlight even as the battered nation tries to make sense of another killing and reels over the mounting COVID-19 death toll. Trump, in his tweets, borrowed a phrase once used by former Miami Police Chief Walter Headley in a 1967 speech outlining his department’s efforts to “combat young hoodlums who have taken advantage of the civil rights campaign.” In the speech, Headley said his department had been successful “because I’ve let the word filter down that when the looting starts, the shooting starts.” “We don’t mind being accused of police brutality,” he said in the same speech, according to news reports from the time. Trump, after hours of backlash, said Friday evening that he was unaware of the origins of the phrase. “But I’ve heard it for a long time, as most people have. And frankly it means when there’s looting, people get shot and they die,” he said. Trump also revealed that he had been in touch with Floyd’s family as he continued to denounce the circumstances of the man’s killing, which he called “a terrible insult to police and to policemen.” “I just expressed my sorrow,” Trump told reporters. “He was in tremendous pain, obviously, and couldn’t breathe. And it was very obvious to anybody that watched it.” Still, Trump called on protesters to keep their demonstrations peaceful. “The family of George is entitled to justice, and the people of Minnesota are entitled to live in safety,” he said. “Law and order will prevail.” Criticism of the Trump’s tweet had been swift, with his presumptive Democratic presidential rival Joe Biden saying it was “no time for incendiary tweets, no time to incite violence.” “It’s not helpful,” said Minnesota’s Democratic Gov. Tim Walz. “Anything we do to add fuel to that fire is really, really challenging.” Rep. Emmanuel Cleaver, D-Mo., said that, as the country passed the grim milestone of more than 100,000 COVID-19 deaths, Trump had missed a chance to help the public cope with “two viruses: One is the coronavirus and the other is the virus of racial animus.” Trump has been accused of stoking racial tensions and exploiting divisions for personal gain since long before he ran for president, beginning with the full-page ads he ran in 1989 calling for the death penalty for the Central Park Five, five young men of color who were wrongly convicted of assaulting a white jogger. Trump — who rarely holds his tongue — has been silent in the face of a long list of high-profile killings by police of black men, including Eric Garner, who was placed in a chokehold and whose dying words, “I can’t breathe,” became a rallying cry for the Black Lives Matter movement. (Trump has instead invoked those words on several occasions to mock political rivals, even bringing his hands to his neck for dramatic effect.) He spent years railing against NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick and other players for kneeling during the National Anthem to protest racial injustice and police brutality. And in one speech he appeared to advocate rougher treatment of people in custody, speaking dismissively of the police practice of shielding the heads of handcuffed suspects as they are being placed in patrol cars. At the same time, Trump and his campaign have tried to make inroads with black Americans, particularly after Biden suggested last week that black voters who support Trump “ain’t black.” A bedrock of the Democratic base, black Americans are unlikely to embrace Trump en masse, but his campaign believes even a marginal shift could make a difference — and send a message to white voters uneasy about the president’s charged rhetoric. Meanwhile, the unrest complicates the Trump campaign’s plans for Minnesota, one of the key swing states he hopes to win in November. Twitter’s decision to flag Trump’s tweet — the second time it has acted this week — came a day after he signed an executive order challenging the social media giant’s protections against lawsuits as he accuses it of stifling conservative voices. The warning label prevented the tweet from being shared or liked, though it could still be viewed by users. The White House, trying to skirt the blockage, reposted the message on its own official Twitter account Friday morning. Twitter quickly flagged that tweet, too, accusing the White House of promoting violence. Supporters of the president balked at the move. Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale accused the media, Biden and other Democrats of “purposefully misrepresenting what the President had said, and showing once again that they are incapable of resisting their base impulse of dividing Americans, solely for the purpose of political gain, ratings, and cable news profit.”",0.0

On the video, Floyd can be seen pleading as Officer Derek Chauvin presses his knee against him. As minutes pass, Floyd slowly stops talking and moving. The 3rd Precinct covers the portion of south Minneapolis where Floyd was arrested. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz earlier Thursday activated the National Guard at the Minneapolis mayor's request, but it wasn't immediately clear when and where the Guard was being deployed, and none could be seen during protests in Minneapolis or St. Paul. The Guard tweeted minutes after the precinct burned that it had activated more than 500 soldiers across the metro area. The Guard said a ""key objective"" was to make sure fire departments could respond to calls, and said in a follow-up tweet it was ""here with the Minneapolis Fire Department"" to assist. But no move was made to put out the 3rd Precinct fire. Assistant Fire Chief Bryan Tyner said fire crews could not safely respond to fires at the precinct station and some surrounding buildings. Earlier Thursday, dozens of businesses across the Twin Cities boarded up their windows and doors in an effort to prevent looting, with Minneapolis-based Target announcing it was temporarily closing two dozen area stores. Minneapolis shut down nearly its entire light-rail system and all bus service through Sunday out of safety concerns. In St. Paul, clouds of smoke hung in the air as police armed with batons and wearing gas masks and body armor kept a watchful eye on protesters along one of the city's main commercial corridors, where firefighters also sprayed water onto a series of small fires. At one point, officers stood in line in front of a Target, trying to keep out looters, who were also smashing windows of other businesses. Hundreds of demonstrators returned Thursday to the Minneapolis neighborhood at the center of the violence, where the nighttime scene veered between an angry protest and a street party. At one point, a band playing in a parking lot across from the 3rd Precinct broke into a punk version of Bob Marley's ""Redemption Song."" Nearby, demonstrators carried clothing mannequins from a looted Target and threw them onto a burning car. Later, a building fire erupted nearby. But elsewhere in Minneapolis, thousands of peaceful demonstrators marched through the streets calling for justice. Floyd's death has deeply shaken Minneapolis and sparked protests in cities across the U.S. Local leaders have repeatedly urged demonstrators to avoid violence. ""Please stay home. Please do not come here to protest. Please keep the focus on George Floyd, on advancing our movement and on preventing this from ever happening again,"" tweeted St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter, who is black. Erika Atson, 20, was among thousands of people who gathered outside government offices in downtown Minneapolis, where organizers had called a peaceful protest. Many protesters wore masks because of the coronavirus pandemic, but there were few attempts at social distancing. Atson, who is black, described seeing her 14- and 11-year-old brothers tackled by Minneapolis police years ago because officers mistakenly presumed the boys had guns. She said she had been at ""every single protest"" since Floyd's death and worried about raising children who could be vulnerable in police encounters. ""We don't want to be here fighting against anyone. We don't want anyone to be hurt. We don't want to cause any damages,"" she said. ""We just want the police officer to be held accountable."" The group marched peacefully for three hours before another confrontation with police broke out, though details were scarce. After calling in the Guard, Walz urged widespread changes in the wake of Floyd's death. ""It is time to rebuild. Rebuild the city, rebuild our justice system and rebuild the relationship between law enforcement and those they're charged to protect,"" Walz said. Much of the Minneapolis violence occurred in the Longfellow neighborhood, where protesters converged on the precinct station of the police who arrested Floyd. In a strip mall across the street from the 3rd Precinct station, the windows in nearly every business had been smashed, from the large Target department store at one end to the Planet Fitness gym at the other. Only the 24-hour laundromat appeared to have escaped unscathed. ""WHY US?"" demanded a large expanse of red graffiti scrawled on the wall of the Target. A Wendy's restaurant across the street was charred almost beyond recognition. Among the casualties of the overnight fires: a six-story building under construction that was to provide nearly 200 apartments of affordable housing. ""We're burning our own neighborhood,"" said a distraught Deona Brown, a 24-year-old woman standing with a friend outside the precinct station, where a small group of protesters were shouting at a dozen or so stone-faced police officers in riot gear. ""This is where we live, where we shop, and they destroyed it."" No officers could be seen beyond the station. ""What that cop did was wrong, but I'm scared now,"" Brown said. Others in the crowd saw something different in the wreckage. Protesters destroyed property ""because the system is broken,"" said a young man who identified himself only by his nickname, Cash, and who said he had been in the streets during the violence. He dismissed the idea that the destruction would hurt residents of the largely black neighborhood. ""They're making money off of us,"" he said angrily of the owners of the destroyed stores. He laughed when asked if he had joined in the looting or violence. ""I didn't break anything."" The protests that began Wednesday night and extended into Thursday were more violent than Tuesday's, which included skirmishes between offices and protesters but no widespread property damage. Mayor Jacob Frey appealed for calm but the city's response to the protests was quickly questioned as things started spiraling into violence. ""If the strategy was to keep residents safe - it failed,"" City Council Member Jeremiah Ellison, who is black, tweeted. ""Prevent property damage - it failed."" On Thursday, he urged police to leave the scene of the overnight violence, saying their presence brings people into the streets. Protests have also spread to other U.S. cities. In New York City, protesters defied New York's coronavirus prohibition on public gatherings Thursday, clashing with police, while demonstrators blocked traffic in downtown Denver. A day earlier, demonstrators had taken to the streets in Los Angeles and Memphis. In Louisville, Kentucky, police confirmed that at least seven people had been shot Thursday night as protesters demanded justice for Breonna Taylor, a black woman who was fatally shot by police in her home in March. Amid the violence in Minneapolis, a man was found fatally shot Wednesday night near a pawn shop, possibly by the owner, authorities said. Fire crews responded to about 30 intentionally set blazes, and multiple fire trucks were damaged by rocks and other projectiles, the fire department said. No one was hurt by the blazes. The city on Thursday released a transcript of the 911 call that brought police to the grocery store where Floyd was arrested. The caller described someone paying with a counterfeit bill, with workers rushing outside to find the man sitting on a van. The caller described the man as ""awfully drunk and he's not in control of himself."" Asked by the 911 operator whether the man was ""under the influence of something,"" the caller said: ""Something like that, yes. He is not acting right."" Police said Floyd matched the caller's description of the suspect. The U.S. Attorney's Office and the FBI in Minneapolis said Thursday they were conducting ""a robust criminal investigation"" into the death. President Donald Trump has said he had asked an investigation to be expedited. The FBI is also investigating whether Floyd's civil rights were violated. Chauvin, the officer who kneeled on Floyd's neck, was fired Tuesday with three other officers involved in the arrest. The next day, the mayor called for Chauvin to be criminally charged. He also appealed for the activation of the National Guard. ___ Associated Press writers Steve Karnowski, Jeff Baenen and Doug Glass in Minneapolis, and Gretchen Ehlke in Milwaukee contributed to this report.",0.0

She said she had been at ""every single protest"" since Floyd's death and worried about raising children who could be vulnerable in police encounters. ""We don't want to be here fighting against anyone. We don't want anyone to be hurt. We don't want to cause any damages,"" she said. ""We just want the police officer to be held accountable."" The group marched peacefully for three hours before another confrontation with police broke out, though details were scarce. After calling in the Guard, Walz urged widespread changes in the wake of Floyd's death. ""It is time to rebuild. Rebuild the city, rebuild our justice system and rebuild the relationship between law enforcement and those they're charged to protect,"" Walz said. Much of the Minneapolis violence occurred in the Longfellow neighborhood, where protesters converged on the precinct station of the police who arrested Floyd. In a strip mall across the street from the 3rd Precinct station, the windows in nearly every business had been smashed, from the large Target department store at one end to the Planet Fitness gym at the other. Only the 24-hour laundromat appeared to have escaped unscathed. ""WHY US?"" demanded a large expanse of red graffiti scrawled on the wall of the Target. A Wendy's restaurant across the street was charred almost beyond recognition. Among the casualties of the overnight fires: a six-story building under construction that was to provide nearly 200 apartments of affordable housing. ""We're burning our own neighborhood,"" said a distraught Deona Brown, a 24-year-old woman standing with a friend outside the precinct station, where a small group of protesters were shouting at a dozen or so stone-faced police officers in riot gear. ""This is where we live, where we shop, and they destroyed it."" No officers could be seen beyond the station. ""What that cop did was wrong, but I'm scared now,"" Brown said. Others in the crowd saw something different in the wreckage. Protesters destroyed property ""because the system is broken,"" said a young man who identified himself only by his nickname, Cash, and who said he had been in the streets during the violence. He dismissed the idea that the destruction would hurt residents of the largely black neighborhood. ""They're making money off of us,"" he said angrily of the owners of the destroyed stores. He laughed when asked if he had joined in the looting or violence. ""I didn't break anything."" The protests that began Wednesday night and extended into Thursday were more violent than Tuesday's, which included skirmishes between offices and protesters but no widespread property damage. Mayor Jacob Frey appealed for calm but the city's response to the protests was quickly questioned as things started spiraling into violence. ""If the strategy was to keep residents safe - it failed,"" City Council Member Jeremiah Ellison, who is black, tweeted. ""Prevent property damage - it failed."" On Thursday, he urged police to leave the scene of the overnight violence, saying their presence brings people into the streets. Protests have also spread to other U.S. cities. In New York City, protesters defied New York's coronavirus prohibition on public gatherings Thursday, clashing with police, while demonstrators blocked traffic in downtown Denver. A day earlier, demonstrators had taken to the streets in Los Angeles and Memphis. In Louisville, Kentucky, police confirmed that at least seven people had been shot Thursday night as protesters demanded justice for Breonna Taylor, a black woman who was fatally shot by police in her home in March. Amid the violence in Minneapolis, a man was found fatally shot Wednesday night near a pawn shop, possibly by the owner, authorities said. Fire crews responded to about 30 intentionally set blazes, and multiple fire trucks were damaged by rocks and other projectiles, the fire department said. No one was hurt by the blazes. The city on Thursday released a transcript of the 911 call that brought police to the grocery store where Floyd was arrested. The caller described someone paying with a counterfeit bill, with workers rushing outside to find the man sitting on a van. The caller described the man as ""awfully drunk and he's not in control of himself."" Asked by the 911 operator whether the man was ""under the influence of something,"" the caller said: ""Something like that, yes. He is not acting right."" Police said Floyd matched the caller's description of the suspect. The U.S. Attorney's Office and the FBI in Minneapolis said Thursday they were conducting ""a robust criminal investigation"" into the death. President Donald Trump has said he had asked an investigation to be expedited. The FBI is also investigating whether Floyd's civil rights were violated. Chauvin, the officer who kneeled on Floyd's neck, was fired Tuesday with three other officers involved in the arrest. The next day, the mayor called for Chauvin to be criminally charged. He also appealed for the activation of the National Guard. ___ Associated Press writers Steve Karnowski, Jeff Baenen and Doug Glass in Minneapolis, and Gretchen Ehlke in Milwaukee contributed to this report.",0.0

On the video, Floyd can be seen pleading as Officer Derek Chauvin presses his knee against him. As minutes pass, Floyd slowly stops talking and moving. The 3rd Precinct covers the portion of south Minneapolis where Floyd was arrested. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz earlier Thursday activated the National Guard at the Minneapolis mayor's request, but it wasn't immediately clear when and where the Guard was being deployed, and none could be seen during protests in Minneapolis or St. Paul. The Guard tweeted minutes after the precinct burned that it had activated more than 500 soldiers across the metro area. The Guard said a ""key objective"" was to make sure fire departments could respond to calls, and said in a follow-up tweet it was ""here with the Minneapolis Fire Department"" to assist. But no move was made to put out the 3rd Precinct fire. Assistant Fire Chief Bryan Tyner said fire crews could not safely respond to fires at the precinct station and some surrounding buildings. Earlier Thursday, dozens of businesses across the Twin Cities boarded up their windows and doors in an effort to prevent looting, with Minneapolis-based Target announcing it was temporarily closing two dozen area stores. Minneapolis shut down nearly its entire light-rail system and all bus service through Sunday out of safety concerns. In St. Paul, clouds of smoke hung in the air as police armed with batons and wearing gas masks and body armor kept a watchful eye on protesters along one of the city's main commercial corridors, where firefighters also sprayed water onto a series of small fires. At one point, officers stood in line in front of a Target, trying to keep out looters, who were also smashing windows of other businesses. Hundreds of demonstrators returned Thursday to the Minneapolis neighborhood at the center of the violence, where the nighttime scene veered between an angry protest and a street party. At one point, a band playing in a parking lot across from the 3rd Precinct broke into a punk version of Bob Marley's ""Redemption Song."" Nearby, demonstrators carried clothing mannequins from a looted Target and threw them onto a burning car. Later, a building fire erupted nearby. But elsewhere in Minneapolis, thousands of peaceful demonstrators marched through the streets calling for justice. Floyd's death has deeply shaken Minneapolis and sparked protests in cities across the U.S. Local leaders have repeatedly urged demonstrators to avoid violence. ""Please stay home. Please do not come here to protest. Please keep the focus on George Floyd, on advancing our movement and on preventing this from ever happening again,"" tweeted St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter, who is black. Erika Atson, 20, was among thousands of people who gathered outside government offices in downtown Minneapolis, where organizers had called a peaceful protest. Many protesters wore masks because of the coronavirus pandemic, but there were few attempts at social distancing. Atson, who is black, described seeing her 14- and 11-year-old brothers tackled by Minneapolis police years ago because officers mistakenly presumed the boys had guns.

1619723583,2020-05-29 02:00:20,Minneapolis police station torched amid George Floyd protest,https://www.abqjournal.com/1460630/george-floyd-protesters-set-minneapolis-police-station-afire.html,en,False,,99,Albuquerque Journal ,http://www.abqjournal.com/,"ADVERTISEMENTSkip ................................................................ The Pentagon took the rare step Friday of ordering the Army to put several active-duty U.S. military police units on the ready to deploy to Minneapolis, according to three people with direct knowledge of the orders who did not want their names used because they were not authorized to discuss the preparations. Ben Hubert, 26, of Minneapolis, said he wasn’t surprised people were breaking curfew and setting fires. “I’m outraged,” he said of the Floyd case. “But I’m also sad. The injustice has been going on for so long. It’s been swelling for years.” Downtown, thousands of protesters encircled a police station after the 8 p.m. curfew. “Prosecute the police!” some chanted, and “Say his name: George Floyd!” There was no violence, though some protesters sprayed graffiti on buildings. The renewed protests came after Officer Derek Chauvin, 44, was charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. He also was accused of ignoring another officer who expressed concerns about Floyd as he lay handcuffed on the ground, pleading that he could not breathe while Chauvin pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes. Floyd, who was black, had been arrested on suspicion of using a counterfeit bill at a store. Chauvin, who was fired along with three other officers who were at the scene, faces more than 12 years in prison if convicted of murder. An attorney for Floyd’s family welcomed the arrest but said he expected a more serious murder charge and wants the other officers arrested, too. Prosecutor Mike Freeman said more charges were possible, but authorities “felt it appropriate to focus on the most dangerous perpetrator.” ADVERTISEMENTSkip ................................................................ As the night dragged on, more fires erupted on the south side: A Japanese restaurant, a Wells Fargo bank, another restaurant, an Office Depot. Many burned for hours. Mayor Jacob Frey tweeted that firefighters could not respond until areas were secure. He said the city was working with the National Guard and the state to “provide support in the south.” Protests nationwide have been fueled by outrage over Floyd’s death and years of police violence against African Americans. Protesters smashed windows at CNN headquarters in Atlanta, set a police car on fire and struck officers with bottles. Large demonstrations in New York, Houston, Washington, D.C., and dozens of other cities ranged from people peacefully blocking roads to repeated clashes with police. “You are disgracing our city,” Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms told protesters. “You are disgracing the life of George Floyd and every other person who has been killed in this country.” Police were trying to put Floyd in a squad car Monday when he stiffened and fell to the ground, saying he was claustrophobic, a criminal complaint said. Chauvin and Officer Tou Thoa arrived and tried several times to get the struggling Floyd into the car. Chauvin eventually pulled Floyd out of the car, and the handcuffed Floyd went to the ground face down. Officer J.K. Kueng held Floyd’s back and Officer Thomas Lane held his legs while Chauvin put his knee on Floyd’s head and neck area, the complaint said. When Lane asked if Floyd should be rolled onto his side, Chauvin said, “No, staying put is where we got him.” Lane said he was “worried about excited delirium or whatever.” An autopsy said the combined effects of being restrained, potential intoxicants in Floyd’s system and his underlying health issues, including heart disease, likely contributed to his death. It revealed nothing to support strangulation as the cause of death. There were no other details about intoxicants, and toxicology results can take weeks. In the 911 call that drew police, the caller describes the man suspected of paying with counterfeit money as “awfully drunk and he’s not in control of himself.” ADVERTISEMENTSkip ................................................................ After Floyd apparently stopped breathing, Lane again said he wanted to roll Floyd onto his side. Kueng checked for a pulse and said he could not find one, according to the complaint. Chauvin had his knee on Floyd’s neck for 8 minutes, 46 seconds, including nearly three minutes after Floyd stopped moving and talking, the complaint said. Chauvin’s attorney had no comment when reached by The Associated Press. The prosecutor highlighted the “extraordinary speed” in charging the case four days after Floyd’s death and defended himself against questions about why it did not happen sooner. Freeman said his office needed time to gather evidence, including what he called the “horrible” video recorded by a bystander. News of the arrest came moments after Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz acknowledged the “abject failure” in responding to this week’s protests and called for swift justice for the officers. Walz said the state took the lead after the police station burned. “Minneapolis and St. Paul are on fire. The fire is still smoldering in our streets. The ashes are symbolic of decades and generations of pain, of anguish unheard,” Walz said. President Donald Trump said Friday that he’d spoken to Floyd’s family and “expressed my sorrow.” He called video of the arrest “just a horrible thing to witness and to watch. It certainly looked like there was no excuse for it.” Attorney Benjamin Crump, who is representing Floyd’s family, asked to take custody of Floyd’s body for an independent autopsy. The doctor who will do the autopsy is Michael Baden, former chief medical examiner of New York City, who was hired to do an autopsy for Eric Garner, a black man who died in 2014 after New York police placed him in a chokehold and he pleaded that he could not breathe. State and federal authorities also are investigating Floyd’s death. ___ Associated Press writers Steve Karnowski, Aaron Morrison and Doug Glass in Minneapolis, Gretchen Ehlke in Milwaukee, Bernard Condon in New York, and James LaPorta in Delray Beach, Fla., contributed to this report.",0.0
1619723581,2020-05-29 02:01:38,Breaking: Police confront protesters in SE ABQ,https://www.abqjournal.com/1460629/police-confront-protesters-in-se-abq.html,en,False,,99,Albuquerque Journal ,http://www.abqjournal.com/,".......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. — Officers in riot gear fired what appeared to be tear gas as they retreated from a confrontation with protesters in a Southeast Albuquerque neighborhood overnight. Gilbert Gallegos, an Albuquerque police spokesman, said there were no reported injuries to anyone involved in the incident. The tensions had risen following an earlier Black Lives Matter demonstration at Central and Wyoming over the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Floyd, a black man, died in police custody on Monday after a white officer restrained him by digging his knee into his neck. ADVERTISEMENTSkip ................................................................ Floyd was handcuffed and could be heard telling the officer he could not breathe. Video of the incident, which was taken by a bystander, has gone viral, sparking protests across the country. The Albuquerque demonstration went on for hours. Gallegos said the situation boiled over late Thursday night after officers stopped and detained a group of people, who allegedly shot dozens of rounds, near the Black Lives Matter protest at Central and Wyoming. Gallegos said several protesters surrounded them following the arrest and became confrontational. At least two police vehicles had their windows smashed out during the blow up. That led to a confrontation on Mesilla, just north of Central, where dozens of protesters waved signs and yelled at officers clad in riot gear, wielding batons. A woman told the Journal that the crowd had followed the police from Central and Wyoming after they saw officers pulling over a vehicle nearby and arresting some men without telling them why. She said officers in riot gear showed up after the protesters began to surround the police. Protesters yelled “I can’t breathe” and “(expletive) the police” as they paced a few feet from the officers. ADVERTISEMENTSkip ................................................................ Dozens of people crowded the block of Mesilla, some recording from their phones at a distance as others blocked the end of the street with their vehicles. The line of riot police began to load onto city buses as a helicopter shined its spotlight onto the gathering and told the crowd to disperse. It was right then that at least three gas canisters were fired into the crowd. A woman was injured, but it was unclear by what. A man began throwing the canisters back at the officers as the crowd ran back toward Central. Protesters gathered around the woman on the ground, and she appeared to be shaken but OK. But it didn’t end there, as Gallegos said after the crowd dispersed someone stole the vehicle that police had initially stopped the four shooting suspects in. Officers followed the vehicle, alongside a couple car loads of protesters, to the University area where it was abandoned. Police tried to arrest the driver when he got into another vehicle, but a group of protesters came to his defense. Officers let the man go to prevent another confrontation. In Minneapolis, protesters set fire to a police station on Thursday. Protesters also clashed with police in New York City, while demonstrators blocked traffic in downtown Denver, according to The Associated Press.",0.0

The statement said there were “some arrests,” but police didn't provide a number.“No officers discharged their service weapons,” police spokesman Sgt. Lamont Washington wrote in an email to The Associated Press. Washington said that all seven were civilians.The protests stretched for more than six hours, ending in the early hours of Friday as rain poured down.“Understandably, emotions are high,” Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer tweeted just before midnight, sharing a Facebook post asking for peace that he said was written on behalf of Taylor's mother. “As Breonna's mother says let's be peaceful as we work toward truth and justice.”Taylor, a 26-year-old emergency medical tech, was shot eight times on March 13 after Louisville narcotics detectives knocked down the front door. No drugs were found in the home.Attention on Taylor's death has intensified after her family sued the police department earlier this month. The case has attracted national headlines alongside the shooting of Ahmaud Arbery in a Georgia neighborhood in February.Thursday's demonstration came as protesters across the country — from Los Angeles to Memphis, Tennessee, to New York to Minneapolis itself — have demonstrated against the death of a black man, George Floyd, in Minneapolis police custody.Around 12:20 a.m., Fischer tweeted a video that he said was a message from Taylor's family.“Louisville, thank you so much for saying Breonna's name tonight. We are not going to stop until we get justice,” a woman says in the video. “But we should stop tonight before people get hurt. Please go home, be safe and be ready to keep fighting.”Meanwhile, live video from downtown Louisville around 12:30 a.m. showed some protesters behind makeshift wooden barricades, which appeared to be made out of picnic tables spray-painted with the words “You can’t kill us all.” Police in body armor and face shields held batons and lined up around Louisville City Hall. They appeared to fire rubber bullets and deploy tear gas canisters, fogging the air and inducing coughs among the remaining members of the crowd.Chants from protesters early Friday included “No justice, no peace” and “Whose streets? Our streets.”",0.0

Submit Privacy Notice A CNN crew was arrested while covering Minneapolis protests Share Shares Copy Link Copy Hide Transcript Show Transcript Omar, It is so good to see you. That was quite a scene of what you've just endured for the past hour. Can you tell us what happened? Well, we saw a lot of it play out on TV there. There seemed to be a little bit of confusion as to what what was supposed to or what was allowed to happen. Now, well, as we're reporting, we had been in verbal contact. At least it seemed, with some of the police officers saying, All right, where can we be? We have heard we played some of it as they were giving out commands for people to clear the area. And we saw that as protesters completely cleared out. And that, of course, came after there was an hour and 1/2. Or at least where we're standing, where there was no sort of police presence. So as people came down, we saw them walking down the block, and whether repress or not, we wanted to make sure we were out of the way. So you so we basically stepped onto the corner is where we were. And I think the moment before the arrest actually happened was we saw at least 11 protester or Allison, who was not media sort of run past us. And that person was cornered by State Patrol was the main unit that seemed to be there. And after that person was apprehended, they then turned toward us now, and that was the first moment I could say that police had gotten behind us. So in a sense, we were sort of surrounded by state patrolman, and it seemed like Minneapolis police officers as well. But again, it was that moment where all of a sudden someone runs past and there are already on edge based on the absolute destruction that's all around them. And that arrests happened just right in front of the Minneapolis Third Precinct. That, of course, went up in flames last night. Omar, I'm not sure you know this, but our cameras were not only rolling the whole time you were taken into custody, but the cameras continue to roll. Frankly, for the entire ride to the precinct, we could see the picture for the whole time. First of all, let me also say, Omar, what an amazing job you did throughout that your composure and your ability to keep your cool is a testament to your professionalism. Um, which we already knew about by how great of a job you're doing covering the story on the streets there. You and your team did a terrific job. Now what we did not hear, even though we saw the transportation, is from the moment you were lead away until the moment you were just released. So can you please tell us what took place while you were in custody? Well, everyone to their credit, was pretty cordial after that happened. So it seemed I was actually talking to the officer that was leading me away. I was like, And then we're gonna be out here for the next few days. What is the guidance of where we should be? If you don't want us that close, where should we? Because we're under the impression that that was OK. And he said, Look, I don't know, man. I'm just following orders, so I don't know who is potentially giving that order in that particular moment. But as far as the people that were leading me away, they there was no animosity there. They weren't they weren't violent with me. We're having conversation about just how crazy this week has been for every single part of the city. And like I mentioned, a lot of these people are on edge. And as we were walking by, we saw a person on the edge of sort of the perimeter that they had formed. And this wasn't a protester. This was just a a random it seemed citizen, who was saying, Hey, I need to get back into my place over there. And where were you when this neighborhood? Completely about the short. I mean, we saw where they were. They were in the middle of what became a focal point of anger, passion, violence, even at times and there they were forced to retreat. And then this morning, literally within a matter of minutes, we saw all of them swarm back in clearing out these protesters from the city level. That's we saw the fire department and Police Department come in. And then the State Patrol was advancing as we're seeing up that street toward our location. Now, where we were standing basically to my right, was where all the protesters were outside or in front of the the building that was on fire and into our left was where they were advancing. So we were basically just going to try and step back and let them continue to advance down the street. But again, you saw what unfolded there. But as far as what happened in between again, they were They were pretty cordial. Once we're in the trucks as well. They were were downtown. Obviously, this is the Hennepin County Public Safety Building here. They're all pretty pretty good with us. Onda conversation. Well, that's a relief, Omar, because you could not have been more professional. You were doing your job by the book. You presented your credentials. You told them that you were a journalist. You told them that you were within and you told them you were. They were. You were live on the air. I mean, you did them the courtesy of explaining that we were live on the air at that moment. And I'm just wondering, after you and your crew were arrested, at what point did they? I mean, did they ever say sorry, that was a mistake. Or when they released you, Was there an explanation of that? That had all been a big misunderstanding or mistake and you're allowed to report there. That conversation may have happened above some of the people that were with for us. It was literally a situation off. Tell me who you are. Me as far as identification purposes than they left. And they came back and said, You're with CNN, Correct? Yes. And then we explained that to other team members that were with me on three, including the security that we that we had hired for this. And then they left, came back and then let us out of the van, were inside the van, handcuffed the whole time. And then we were sat down, waited for a little bit more, and then from there, that was when they eventually came back with our with our belongings that they confiscated. Over the course of this, they had they unclipped our handcuffs. And then that is when we were let out. And again, it's answer your question. There was no sort of sorry. This is a big misunderstanding, blah, blah, blah, because it seems that conversation may have happened. But it didn't happen with us in particular, but also is the difference of jurisdiction. Just just one more question because it was It was a nerve racking moment for all of us watching. You know, Bakari Sellers just described watching it and saying that it was really emotional and heart pumping for him because he was scared for you and other people watching. Given the backdrop of everything that's happening in Minneapolis, he was scared for you at this moment when you were being taken into custody. You know, I should also let you know that Josh Campbell, who was reporting a block or two away from you, was not taken into custody. He was treated quite politely. Were you scared when this was happening? And do you have any idea why you were arrested and not Josh Kim? Well, there was a moment, I would say, minutes after it happened, where things started to sink in a little bit. I think I don't have to tell you Alison or John that sometimes when you're in this job in these scenarios, there's a lot of adrenaline pumping. You're trying to focus and balance so many different factors. In a case like this, I'm tryingto balance what the actual story is, how the story line is advancing while also trying to be aware of our surroundings, which at times can get dangerous. So there's that mentality, and then the arrest happened. I was still trying to communicate with you all as this was going on, because I was just confused as you. We have been showing our credentials throughout this entire week, and especially in the moments leading up to that. So I couldn't really understand what was going on. But as we were walking away and you're sort of taking in the entire neighborhood that had been completely decimated again from the passion of the protesters and unfortunately, some of the rioting and looting that we had seen. It did cross my mind that what is really happening here, and the one thing that gave me a little bit of comfort was that it happened on live TV. There has been this When you talk within the community about, let's just say what's happened with George Floyd. There's always a discussion that what's happening isn't new. It's being filmed, and that speaks to the power of having something happen on camera because you can have people speak up for you without you saying anything. And that gave me a little bit of comfort knowing that you guys saw what was happening. I was living what was happening, and the country was seeing what was happening unfold in real time, right before their eyes. You don't have to doubt my story. It's not filtered in any sort of way. You saw it for your own eyes, and that gave me a little bit of comfort, but it definitely was nerve racking a certain point.",0.0
1619994609,2020-05-29 01:56:34,7 shot at Louisville protest over fatal police shooting,https://www.krqe.com/news/national/7-shot-at-louisville-protest-over-fatal-police-shooting/,en,True,,662160,KRQE,https://www.krqe.com/,"In a photo provided by Jada W., protesters gather Thursday, May 28, 2020, in downtown Louisville, Ky., against the police shooting of Breonna Taylor, a black woman fatally shot by police in her home in March. At least seven people were shot during the protest. (Jada W. via AP) LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) — Looking to defuse anger after gunfire wounded at least seven people at a protest in Louisville, the mother of a black woman killed by police urged protesters Friday to continue demanding justice but do so “without hurting each other.” Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear read the statement from Breonna Taylor’s mother hours after gunshots erupted during protests late Thursday outside City Hall. One person was in critical condition, Louisville Metro Police said Friday. Mayor Greg Fischer said police officers fired no shots. Instead, they provided aid to the wounded, he said. TV video showed terrified protesters fleeing as gunfire erupted. With more rallies planned, Taylor’s mother joined the chorus of calls for protests to remain peaceful. In her statement, Tamika Palmer said her daughter — an emergency medical technician — devoted her life to others and the “last thing she’d want right now is any more violence.” “Please keep saying her name,” her statement said. “Please keep demanding justice and accountability, but let’s do it the right way without hurting each other. We can and we will make some real change here. Now is the time. Let’s make it happen, but safely.” On Friday evening, what appeared to be several hundred people gathered downtown for the second night of protests. The crowd briefly blocked traffic near City Hall and chanted, “No justice, no peace.” Protesters carried signs calling for justice for Breonna Taylor and George Floyd, the black man who died after a Minneapolis police officerpressed his knee into Floyd’s neck for several minutes even after he stopped moving and pleading for air. Police presence intensified around 9:45 p.m. Friday, as officers in riot gear stood shoulder-to-shoulder moving people down a key street near City Hall, the Courier Journal reported. A police officer was seen on camera during a WAVE-TV broadcast firing what appeared to be pepper bullets directly at the camera crew. “I’m getting shot! I’m getting shot!” WAVE-TV reporter Kaitlin Rust is heard yelling off-camera. She told the indignant anchors int he studio that the crew was behind the line, but police wanted them to move further away. Police spokeswoman Jessie Halladay said no shots had been fired at Friday’s protest as of 10:40 p.m. and no significant injuries had been reported. Two people were arrested. Bracing for more protests, police said they wouldn’t tolerate violence or property destruction. “We value the right to free speech and understand this community has a lot to say right now,” Louisville police Lt. Col. LaVita Chavous said. “We hear you.” But she added that police were prepared to “take whatever action we must to try to ensure no one else is injured during this time of unrest. We ask the community to please voice your opinions in a peaceful way.” Meanwhile, Louisville’s mayor said the use of no-knock warrants by police was being suspended, the latest in a series of policy changes and others actions in response to Taylor’s death. “To the people who gathered downtown last night to protest, and to many more throughout our city and throughout our country who feel angry, hurt, afraid, frustrated, tired and sick of story after story of black lives ending at the hands of law enforcement, I hear you,” Fischer said. Two people wounded in the gunfire underwent surgery, while five were in good condition, he said. Beshear, speaking on CNN, said Thursday’s protest started peacefully but some people later “turned it into something that it should not have been.” Local Councilwoman Keisha Dorsey termed the protest as “a revolt against a system in which people have felt oppressed,” the Courier Journal reported. “What I’m seeing is people who are trying their best to do something with their hurt, their pain and their frustration.” The Louisville protests followed the release of a 911 call Taylor’s boyfriend made on March 13, moments after the 26-year-old EMT was shot eight times by narcotics detectives who knocked down her front door. No drugs were found in the home. Hundreds of demonstrators marched through downtown Louisville, ending in the early hours of Friday as rain poured down. Windows were broken and several vehicles were damaged during the unrest, police said. Shots were fired into government buildings, including police headquarters, they said. Bricks were thrown into buildings and graffiti was splashed in several places, including a firefighter memorial, they said. The police description of the damage made no reference to any looting. Jordan Basham, a 24-year-old white bartender, said she was a few feet from where the people were shot. As people fled in terror, a man she didn’t know pushed her to the ground, told her not to move and used his own body to shield her, she said Friday. “I’ll never be able to get that picture out of my mind,” she said. “But I am still very glad that I was there. As long as they’re out there protesting, I’ll be back.” Many protesters wore masks as Kentuckians are strongly urged to follow health guidelines to contain the coronavirus pandemic. Attention on Taylor’s death has intensified since her family sued the police department this month. The case has attracted national headlines alongside the shooting of Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia in February and the recent death of Floyd. A scream is first heard off camera. “I’m getting shot! I’m getting shot!” Kaitlin Rust is heard saying. “It’s OK, it’s those pepper bullets” “They’re telling us to move now, farther away” “We were behind their line, I guess, a little too close for comfort.”",0.0
1619994606,2020-05-29 04:46:06,Minneapolis police station torched amid George Floyd protest,https://www.krqe.com/news/national/minneapolis-police-station-torched-amid-george-floyd-protest/,en,True,,662160,KRQE,https://www.krqe.com/,"MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Thick smoke hovered over Minneapolis on Friday, hours after cheering protesters torched a police station that officers abandoned as a third night of violent protests flared over the death of George Floyd, a handcuffed black man who pleaded for air as a white police officer knelt on his neck. Police evacuated the 3rd Precinct station, the focus of many of the protests, late Thursday to protect employees, a spokesman said. Livestream video showed protesters entering the building, where intentionally set fires activated smoke alarms and sprinklers. President Donald Trump threatened action, prompting a warning from Twitter for “glorifying violence.” Dozens of fires were also set in nearby St. Paul, where nearly 200 businesses were damaged or looted. Protests spread across the U.S., fueled by outrage over Floyd’s death, and years of violence against African Americans at the hands of police. Demonstrators clashed with officers in New York and blocked traffic in Columbus, Ohio, and Denver. Trump threatened to bring Minneapolis “under control,” calling the protesters “thugs” and tweeting that “when the looting starts, the shooting starts.” The tweet drew another warning from Twitter, which said the comment violated the platform’s rules, but the company did not remove it. Trump also blasted the “total lack of leadership” in Minneapolis. A visibly tired and frustrated Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey made his first public appearance of the night early Friday at City Hall and took responsibility for evacuating the precinct, saying it had become too dangerous for officers. As Frey continued, a reporter cut across loudly with a question: “What’s the plan here?” “With regard to?” Frey responded. Then he added: “There is a lot of pain and anger right now in our city. I understand that … What we have seen over the past several hours and past couple of nights here in terms of looting is unacceptable.” He defended the city’s lack of engagement with looters — only a handful of arrests across the first two nights of violence — and said, “We are doing absolutely everything that we can to keep the peace.” He said National Guard members were stationed in locations to help stem looting, including at banks, grocery stores and pharmacies. The Minnesota State Patrol arrested a CNN television crew early Friday as the journalists reported on the unrest. While live on air, CNN reporter Omar Jimenez was handcuffed and led away. A producer and a photojournalist for CNN were also taken away in handcuffs. The Minnesota State Patrol said the journalists were among four people arrested as troopers were “clearing the streets and restoring order,” and they were released after being confirmed to be media members. CNN said on Twitter that the arrests were “a clear violation of their First Amendment rights.” Firefighters worked Friday to contain a number of blazes as National Guard troops blocked access to streets where businesses had been damaged. They marched side by side and block by block as they expanded a perimeter around a heavily damaged area. Protests first erupted Tuesday, a day after Floyd’s death in a confrontation with police captured on widely seen citizen video. In the footage, Floyd can be seen pleading as officer Derek Chauvin presses his knee against him. As minutes pass, Floyd slowly stops talking and moving. Gov. Tim Walz activated the National Guard at the Minneapolis mayor’s request. The Guard tweeted minutes after the precinct burned that it had activated more than 500 soldiers across the metro area. A couple dozen Guard members, armed with assault-style rifles, blocked a street Friday morning near a Target store that has sustained heavy damage by looters. The Guard said a “key objective” was to make sure firefighters could respond to calls, and said in a follow-up tweet that soldiers would assist the Minneapolis Fire Department. But no move was made to put out the 3rd Precinct fire. Assistant Fire Chief Bryan Tyner said fire crews could not safely respond to blazes at the precinct station and some surrounding buildings. Earlier Thursday, dozens of businesses across the Twin Cities boarded up their windows and doors in an effort to prevent looting, with Minneapolis-based Target announcing it was temporarily closing two dozen area stores. Minneapolis shut down nearly its entire light-rail system and all bus service through Sunday out of safety concerns. By Thursday night, hundreds of demonstrators returned to the Minneapolis neighborhood at the center of the violence. Demonstrators carried clothing mannequins from a looted Target and threw them onto a burning car. Elsewhere in Minneapolis, thousands of peaceful demonstrators marched through the streets calling for justice. Local leaders repeatedly urged demonstrators to avoid violence. “Please stay home. Please do not come here to protest. Please keep the focus on George Floyd, on advancing our movement and on preventing this from ever happening again,” tweeted St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter, who is black. Erika Atson, 20, was among thousands of people who gathered outside government offices in downtown Minneapolis, where organizers had called for a peaceful protest. Many protesters wore masks because of the coronavirus pandemic, but there were few attempts at social distancing. Atson, who is black, described seeing her 14- and 11-year-old brothers tackled by Minneapolis police years ago because officers mistakenly presumed the boys had guns. She said she had been at “every single protest” since Floyd’s death and worried about raising children who could be vulnerable in police encounters. “We don’t want to be here fighting against anyone. We don’t want anyone to be hurt. We don’t want to cause any damages,” she said. “We just want the police officer to be held accountable.” The group marched peacefully for three hours before another confrontation with police broke out, though details were scarce. After calling in the Guard on Thursday, Walz urged widespread changes in the wake of Floyd’s death. “It is time to rebuild. Rebuild the city, rebuild our justice system and rebuild the relationship between law enforcement and those they’re charged to protect,” Walz said. Among the casualties of the protests: a six-story building under construction that was to provide nearly 200 apartments of affordable housing. “We’re burning our own neighborhood,” said a distraught Deona Brown, a 24-year-old woman standing with a friend outside the precinct station, where a small group of protesters were shouting at a dozen or so stone-faced police officers in riot gear. “This is where we live, where we shop, and they destroyed it.” “What that cop did was wrong, but I’m scared now,” Brown said. Others in the crowd saw something different in the wreckage. Protesters destroyed property “because the system is broken,” said a young man who identified himself only by his nickname, Cash, and who said he had been in the streets during the violence. He dismissed the idea that the destruction would hurt residents of the largely black neighborhood. “They’re making money off of us,” he said angrily of the owners of the destroyed stores. He laughed when asked if he had joined in the looting or violence. “I didn’t break anything.” In New York City, protesters defied New York’s coronavirus prohibition on public gatherings Thursday, clashing with police, while demonstrators blocked traffic in downtown Denver and downtown Columbus. A day earlier, demonstrators had taken to the streets in Los Angeles and Memphis. In Louisville, Kentucky, police confirmed that at least seven people had been shot Thursday night as protesters demanded justice for Breonna Taylor, a black woman who was fatally shot by police in her home in March. Anger over the killing extended to Africa, where the head of the African Union Commission on Friday rejected “continuing discriminatory practices against black citizens of the USA.” In a series of tweets, Moussa Faki Mahamat urged the “total elimination” of all forms of racism in the U.S. In Mississippi, the mayor of the community of Petal resisted calls to resign following his remarks about Floyd’s death. Hal Marx, a Republican, asked on Twitter: “Why in the world would anyone choose to become a police officer in our society today?” In a follow-up tweet, he said he “didn’t see anything unreasonable.” The city on Thursday released a transcript of the 911 call that brought police to the grocery store where Floyd was arrested. The caller described someone paying with a counterfeit bill, with workers rushing outside to find the man sitting on a van. The caller described the man as “awfully drunk” and said he was “not in control of himself.” Asked by the 911 operator whether the man was “under the influence of something,” the caller said: “Something like that, yes. He is not acting right.” Police said Floyd matched the caller’s description of the suspect. State and federal authorities are investigating Floyd’s death. Chauvin, the officer who knelt on Floyd’s neck, was fired Tuesday, along with three other officers involved in the arrest. ___ Associated Press writers Steve Karnowski, Jeff Baenen and Doug Glass in Minneapolis, Gretchen Ehlke in Milwaukee, and Aaron Morrison in New York contributed to this report.",0.0

Ohio Governor Mike DeWine held a news conference Friday to talk about Floyd’s death and the protests in downtown Columbus on Thursday night. “While Fran and I feel sorrow and disgust at what we saw, we cannot fully comprehend or imagine what an African American family must feel,” DeWine said. “His death impacts all of us. We have a responsibility to each other . . . regardless of race, to stand up and speak out and say ‘We won’t tolerate conduct like this.'” Floyd was restrained by officer Derek Chauvin, who dug his knee into Floyd’s neck. Chauvin was arrested Friday and charged with third degree murder and manslaughter. “This officer’s conduct violated every principle of human decency, but it also violated any kind of basic police training,” DeWine said. Peaceful protests in Columbus turned violent when some involved began throwing objects at police officers. Police responded by using tear gas to push the crowd back. The crowd let up, but an hour later the protest escalated when demonstrators smashed windows at the Ohio Statehouse while some went inside the building. “Protests expressing outrage are not only understandable, they are appropriate,” DeWine said. “Ohioans should speak out against wrongdoing. Ohioans should speak out for change . . . I ask my fellow Ohio citizens today as you gather in protest in the coming days throughout Ohio, regardless of the issue, please do so peacefully. We must not fight violence with more violence.” SWAT arrived on the scene soon after the Statehouse break-in. Officers used a loudspeaker to announce an emergency was declared in the area, meaning any protesters who refused to leave would be arrested. “The Columbus Police officers who responded to the Statehouse area yesterday put their own lives at risk and did an excellent job,” DeWine said. “The vast majority, almost all police officers do a good job. But we have a moral obligation to make sure every officer, all 35,000, have the proper training.” More of the damage left behind by tonight’s demonstrations downtown. Police are still out around downtown.

Half of the group is now on the move heading down Broad St. @nbc4i pic.twitter.com/S173HcF51q — Adrienne Robbins (@ARobbinsTV) May 29, 2020 The protestors in Columbus chanted, “Black Lives Matter” and “Say His Name” in reference to Floyd and “I Can’t Breathe” in reference to the 2014 death of Eric Garner. Garner was placed in a choke hold during an arrest and officer Daniel Pantaleo kept him in the choke hold while Garner told the officers “I can’t breathe” several times. A grand jury decided to not indict Pantaleo. Columbus Mayor Andrew Ginther and Columbus City Council President Shannon Hardin both responded to the protests on Twitter urging those involved to protest peacefully.

Columbus police say several businesses were damaged during the protests, and multiple people were detained. “It’s OK, to exercise your amendment rights and your freedom of speech, and we encourage that. It’s OK to do that. However, it is not acceptable to exercise those amendment rights and then turn to criminal actions such as criminal damaging and vandalism,” said Sgt. James Fuqua with the Columbus Division of Police.

Deputies will uphold the public’s right to protest peacefully, but acts of violence and criminal damaging won’t be tolerated. I want to be clear the Franklin County Sheriff’s Office is listening. In recent years, we have established a Community Advisory Board that serves as a liaison between the public and law enforcement, and our deputies routinely attend block watch and community meetings, and town hall forums. The FCSO is committed to hearing the concerns, frustrations, fears, and needs of the people we have sworn to protect and serve. It is my sincere hope that the sheriff’s office will continue to play a meaningful role in building a bridge of trust, and promoting healing,” Franklin County Sheriff Dallas Baldwin released in a statement. According to a release from State House officials, the following damage was reported after the protests: Windows: 28 Statehouse window panes shattered along the West and South sides of the Statehouse, as well as damage to the wood frames. · Damage to the State St. door · Damage to the West Rotunda doors Exterior West Plaza 5 Pole Lamps North Plaza No Damage East Plaza Fire damage to flags in flower beds Flower bed damage from fire South Plaza Bench, SE Node (Granite and bench damaged) There was no damage to the Atrium or Senate Building. Many of the trash cans on the exterior were dumped and thrown. Some cans missing, lids missing, cans dented.

At least seven people were shot during the protest. (Jada W. via AP) LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) — Looking to defuse anger after gunfire wounded at least seven people at a protest in Louisville, the mother of a black woman killed by police urged protesters Friday to continue demanding justice but do so “without hurting each other.” Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear read the statement from Breonna Taylor’s mother hours after gunshots erupted during protests late Thursday outside City Hall. One person was in critical condition, Louisville Metro Police said Friday. Mayor Greg Fischer said police officers fired no shots. Instead, they provided aid to the wounded, he said. TV video showed terrified protesters fleeing as gunfire erupted. With more rallies planned, Taylor’s mother joined the chorus of calls for protests to remain peaceful. In her statement, Tamika Palmer said her daughter — an emergency medical technician — devoted her life to others and the “last thing she’d want right now is any more violence.” “Please keep saying her name,” her statement said. “Please keep demanding justice and accountability, but let’s do it the right way without hurting each other. We can and we will make some real change here. Now is the time. Let’s make it happen, but safely.” On Friday evening, what appeared to be several hundred people gathered downtown for the second night of protests. The crowd briefly blocked traffic near City Hall and chanted, “No justice, no peace.” Protesters carried signs calling for justice for Breonna Taylor and George Floyd, the black man who died after a Minneapolis police officerpressed his knee into Floyd’s neck for several minutes even after he stopped moving and pleading for air. Police presence intensified around 9:45 p.m. Friday, as officers in riot gear stood shoulder-to-shoulder moving people down a key street near City Hall, the Courier Journal reported. A police officer was seen on camera during a WAVE-TV broadcast firing what appeared to be pepper bullets directly at the camera crew. “I’m getting shot! I’m getting shot!” WAVE-TV reporter Kaitlin Rust is heard yelling off-camera. She told the indignant anchors int he studio that the crew was behind the line, but police wanted them to move further away. Police spokeswoman Jessie Halladay said no shots had been fired at Friday’s protest as of 10:40 p.m. and no significant injuries had been reported. Two people were arrested. Bracing for more protests, police said they wouldn’t tolerate violence or property destruction. “We value the right to free speech and understand this community has a lot to say right now,” Louisville police Lt. Col. LaVita Chavous said. “We hear you.” But she added that police were prepared to “take whatever action we must to try to ensure no one else is injured during this time of unrest. We ask the community to please voice your opinions in a peaceful way.” Meanwhile, Louisville’s mayor said the use of no-knock warrants by police was being suspended, the latest in a series of policy changes and others actions in response to Taylor’s death. “To the people who gathered downtown last night to protest, and to many more throughout our city and throughout our country who feel angry, hurt, afraid, frustrated, tired and sick of story after story of black lives ending at the hands of law enforcement, I hear you,” Fischer said. Two people wounded in the gunfire underwent surgery, while five were in good condition, he said. Beshear, speaking on CNN, said Thursday’s protest started peacefully but some people later “turned it into something that it should not have been.” Local Councilwoman Keisha Dorsey termed the protest as “a revolt against a system in which people have felt oppressed,” the Courier Journal reported. “What I’m seeing is people who are trying their best to do something with their hurt, their pain and their frustration.” The Louisville protests followed the release of a 911 call Taylor’s boyfriend made on March 13, moments after the 26-year-old EMT was shot eight times by narcotics detectives who knocked down her front door. No drugs were found in the home. Hundreds of demonstrators marched through downtown Louisville, ending in the early hours of Friday as rain poured down. Windows were broken and several vehicles were damaged during the unrest, police said. Shots were fired into government buildings, including police headquarters, they said. Bricks were thrown into buildings and graffiti was splashed in several places, including a firefighter memorial, they said. The police description of the damage made no reference to any looting. Jordan Basham, a 24-year-old white bartender, said she was a few feet from where the people were shot. As people fled in terror, a man she didn’t know pushed her to the ground, told her not to move and used his own body to shield her, she said Friday. “I’ll never be able to get that picture out of my mind,” she said. “But I am still very glad that I was there. As long as they’re out there protesting, I’ll be back.” Many protesters wore masks as Kentuckians are strongly urged to follow health guidelines to contain the coronavirus pandemic. Attention on Taylor’s death has intensified since her family sued the police department this month. The case has attracted national headlines alongside the shooting of Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia in February and the recent death of Floyd. A scream is first heard off camera. “I’m getting shot! I’m getting shot!” Kaitlin Rust is heard saying. “It’s OK, it’s those pepper bullets” “They’re telling us to move now, farther away” “We were behind their line, I guess, a little too close for comfort.”",0.0
1619997544,2020-05-29 04:46:06,Minneapolis police station torched amid George Floyd protest,https://www.krqe.com/news/national/minneapolis-police-station-torched-amid-george-floyd-protest/,en,True,,96605,krqe.com,http://www.krqe.com/#spider,"MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Thick smoke hovered over Minneapolis on Friday, hours after cheering protesters torched a police station that officers abandoned as a third night of violent protests flared over the death of George Floyd, a handcuffed black man who pleaded for air as a white police officer knelt on his neck. Police evacuated the 3rd Precinct station, the focus of many of the protests, late Thursday to protect employees, a spokesman said. Livestream video showed protesters entering the building, where intentionally set fires activated smoke alarms and sprinklers. President Donald Trump threatened action, prompting a warning from Twitter for “glorifying violence.” Dozens of fires were also set in nearby St. Paul, where nearly 200 businesses were damaged or looted. Protests spread across the U.S., fueled by outrage over Floyd’s death, and years of violence against African Americans at the hands of police. Demonstrators clashed with officers in New York and blocked traffic in Columbus, Ohio, and Denver. Trump threatened to bring Minneapolis “under control,” calling the protesters “thugs” and tweeting that “when the looting starts, the shooting starts.” The tweet drew another warning from Twitter, which said the comment violated the platform’s rules, but the company did not remove it. Trump also blasted the “total lack of leadership” in Minneapolis. A visibly tired and frustrated Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey made his first public appearance of the night early Friday at City Hall and took responsibility for evacuating the precinct, saying it had become too dangerous for officers. As Frey continued, a reporter cut across loudly with a question: “What’s the plan here?” “With regard to?” Frey responded. Then he added: “There is a lot of pain and anger right now in our city. I understand that … What we have seen over the past several hours and past couple of nights here in terms of looting is unacceptable.” He defended the city’s lack of engagement with looters — only a handful of arrests across the first two nights of violence — and said, “We are doing absolutely everything that we can to keep the peace.” He said National Guard members were stationed in locations to help stem looting, including at banks, grocery stores and pharmacies. The Minnesota State Patrol arrested a CNN television crew early Friday as the journalists reported on the unrest. While live on air, CNN reporter Omar Jimenez was handcuffed and led away. A producer and a photojournalist for CNN were also taken away in handcuffs. The Minnesota State Patrol said the journalists were among four people arrested as troopers were “clearing the streets and restoring order,” and they were released after being confirmed to be media members. CNN said on Twitter that the arrests were “a clear violation of their First Amendment rights.” Firefighters worked Friday to contain a number of blazes as National Guard troops blocked access to streets where businesses had been damaged. They marched side by side and block by block as they expanded a perimeter around a heavily damaged area. Protests first erupted Tuesday, a day after Floyd’s death in a confrontation with police captured on widely seen citizen video. In the footage, Floyd can be seen pleading as officer Derek Chauvin presses his knee against him. As minutes pass, Floyd slowly stops talking and moving. Gov. Tim Walz activated the National Guard at the Minneapolis mayor’s request. The Guard tweeted minutes after the precinct burned that it had activated more than 500 soldiers across the metro area. A couple dozen Guard members, armed with assault-style rifles, blocked a street Friday morning near a Target store that has sustained heavy damage by looters. The Guard said a “key objective” was to make sure firefighters could respond to calls, and said in a follow-up tweet that soldiers would assist the Minneapolis Fire Department. But no move was made to put out the 3rd Precinct fire. Assistant Fire Chief Bryan Tyner said fire crews could not safely respond to blazes at the precinct station and some surrounding buildings. Earlier Thursday, dozens of businesses across the Twin Cities boarded up their windows and doors in an effort to prevent looting, with Minneapolis-based Target announcing it was temporarily closing two dozen area stores. Minneapolis shut down nearly its entire light-rail system and all bus service through Sunday out of safety concerns. By Thursday night, hundreds of demonstrators returned to the Minneapolis neighborhood at the center of the violence. Demonstrators carried clothing mannequins from a looted Target and threw them onto a burning car. Elsewhere in Minneapolis, thousands of peaceful demonstrators marched through the streets calling for justice. Local leaders repeatedly urged demonstrators to avoid violence. “Please stay home. Please do not come here to protest. Please keep the focus on George Floyd, on advancing our movement and on preventing this from ever happening again,” tweeted St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter, who is black. Erika Atson, 20, was among thousands of people who gathered outside government offices in downtown Minneapolis, where organizers had called for a peaceful protest. Many protesters wore masks because of the coronavirus pandemic, but there were few attempts at social distancing. Atson, who is black, described seeing her 14- and 11-year-old brothers tackled by Minneapolis police years ago because officers mistakenly presumed the boys had guns. She said she had been at “every single protest” since Floyd’s death and worried about raising children who could be vulnerable in police encounters. “We don’t want to be here fighting against anyone. We don’t want anyone to be hurt. We don’t want to cause any damages,” she said. “We just want the police officer to be held accountable.” The group marched peacefully for three hours before another confrontation with police broke out, though details were scarce. After calling in the Guard on Thursday, Walz urged widespread changes in the wake of Floyd’s death. “It is time to rebuild. Rebuild the city, rebuild our justice system and rebuild the relationship between law enforcement and those they’re charged to protect,” Walz said. Among the casualties of the protests: a six-story building under construction that was to provide nearly 200 apartments of affordable housing. “We’re burning our own neighborhood,” said a distraught Deona Brown, a 24-year-old woman standing with a friend outside the precinct station, where a small group of protesters were shouting at a dozen or so stone-faced police officers in riot gear. “This is where we live, where we shop, and they destroyed it.” “What that cop did was wrong, but I’m scared now,” Brown said. Others in the crowd saw something different in the wreckage. Protesters destroyed property “because the system is broken,” said a young man who identified himself only by his nickname, Cash, and who said he had been in the streets during the violence. He dismissed the idea that the destruction would hurt residents of the largely black neighborhood. “They’re making money off of us,” he said angrily of the owners of the destroyed stores. He laughed when asked if he had joined in the looting or violence. “I didn’t break anything.” In New York City, protesters defied New York’s coronavirus prohibition on public gatherings Thursday, clashing with police, while demonstrators blocked traffic in downtown Denver and downtown Columbus. A day earlier, demonstrators had taken to the streets in Los Angeles and Memphis. In Louisville, Kentucky, police confirmed that at least seven people had been shot Thursday night as protesters demanded justice for Breonna Taylor, a black woman who was fatally shot by police in her home in March. Anger over the killing extended to Africa, where the head of the African Union Commission on Friday rejected “continuing discriminatory practices against black citizens of the USA.” In a series of tweets, Moussa Faki Mahamat urged the “total elimination” of all forms of racism in the U.S. In Mississippi, the mayor of the community of Petal resisted calls to resign following his remarks about Floyd’s death. Hal Marx, a Republican, asked on Twitter: “Why in the world would anyone choose to become a police officer in our society today?” In a follow-up tweet, he said he “didn’t see anything unreasonable.” The city on Thursday released a transcript of the 911 call that brought police to the grocery store where Floyd was arrested. The caller described someone paying with a counterfeit bill, with workers rushing outside to find the man sitting on a van. The caller described the man as “awfully drunk” and said he was “not in control of himself.” Asked by the 911 operator whether the man was “under the influence of something,” the caller said: “Something like that, yes. He is not acting right.” Police said Floyd matched the caller’s description of the suspect. State and federal authorities are investigating Floyd’s death. Chauvin, the officer who knelt on Floyd’s neck, was fired Tuesday, along with three other officers involved in the arrest. ___ Associated Press writers Steve Karnowski, Jeff Baenen and Doug Glass in Minneapolis, Gretchen Ehlke in Milwaukee, and Aaron Morrison in New York contributed to this report.",0.0

Ohio Governor Mike DeWine held a news conference Friday to talk about Floyd’s death and the protests in downtown Columbus on Thursday night. “While Fran and I feel sorrow and disgust at what we saw, we cannot fully comprehend or imagine what an African American family must feel,” DeWine said. “His death impacts all of us. We have a responsibility to each other . . . regardless of race, to stand up and speak out and say ‘We won’t tolerate conduct like this.'” Floyd was restrained by officer Derek Chauvin, who dug his knee into Floyd’s neck. Chauvin was arrested Friday and charged with third degree murder and manslaughter. “This officer’s conduct violated every principle of human decency, but it also violated any kind of basic police training,” DeWine said. Peaceful protests in Columbus turned violent when some involved began throwing objects at police officers. Police responded by using tear gas to push the crowd back. The crowd let up, but an hour later the protest escalated when demonstrators smashed windows at the Ohio Statehouse while some went inside the building. “Protests expressing outrage are not only understandable, they are appropriate,” DeWine said. “Ohioans should speak out against wrongdoing. Ohioans should speak out for change . . . I ask my fellow Ohio citizens today as you gather in protest in the coming days throughout Ohio, regardless of the issue, please do so peacefully. We must not fight violence with more violence.” SWAT arrived on the scene soon after the Statehouse break-in. Officers used a loudspeaker to announce an emergency was declared in the area, meaning any protesters who refused to leave would be arrested. “The Columbus Police officers who responded to the Statehouse area yesterday put their own lives at risk and did an excellent job,” DeWine said. “The vast majority, almost all police officers do a good job. But we have a moral obligation to make sure every officer, all 35,000, have the proper training.” More of the damage left behind by tonight’s demonstrations downtown.

It is my sincere hope that the sheriff’s office will continue to play a meaningful role in building a bridge of trust, and promoting healing,” Franklin County Sheriff Dallas Baldwin released in a statement.

LOS ANGELES — Murder. Brutality. Reprehensible. Indefensible. Police nationwide, in unequivocal and unprecedented language, have condemned the actions of Minneapolis police in the custody death of a handcuffed black man who cried for help as an officer knelt on his neck, pinning him to the pavement for at least eight minutes. But some civil rights advocates say their denunciations are empty words without meaningful reform behind them. Authorities say George Floyd was detained Monday because he matched the description of someone who tried to pay with a counterfeit bill at a convenience store, and the 46-year-old resisted arrest. A bystander’s disturbing video shows Officer Derek Chauvin, who is white, kneeling on Floyd’s neck, even as Floyd begs for air and slowly stops talking and moving. ADVERTISEMENTSkip ................................................................ “There is no need to see more video,” Chattanooga, Tennessee, Police Chief David Roddy tweeted Wednesday. “There no need to wait to see how ‘it plays out’. There is no need to put a knee on someone’s neck for NINE minutes. There IS a need to DO something. If you wear a badge and you don’t have an issue with this … turn it in.” The reaction from some law enforcement stands in stark contrast to their muted response or support for police after other in-custody fatalities. Sheriffs and police chiefs have strongly criticized the Minneapolis officer on social media and praised the city’s police chief for his quick dismissal of four officers at the scene. Some even called for them to be criminally charged. “I am deeply disturbed by the video of Mr. Floyd being murdered in the street with other officers there letting it go on,” Polk County, Georgia, Sheriff Johnny Moats wrote on Facebook. “I can assure everyone, me or any of my deputies will never treat anyone like that as long as I’m Sheriff. This kind of brutality is terrible and it needs to stop. All Officers involved need to be arrested and charged immediately. Praying for the family.” Typically, police call for patience and calm in the wake of a use of force. They are reluctant to weigh in on episodes involving another agency, often citing ongoing investigations or due process. “Not going hide behind ‘not being there,'” tweeted San Jose Police, California, Chief Eddie Garcia. “I’d be one of the first to condemn anyone had I seen similar happen to one of my brother/ sister officers. What I saw happen to George Floyd disturbed me and is not consistent with the goal of our mission. The act of one, impacts us all.” But Gloria Browne-Marshall, a civil rights attorney and professor at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice, said she wouldn’t be a “cheerleader” for a “handful” of chiefs who harshly decried the officers’ behavior. “Any minute progress is seen as miraculous because so little has been done for so long,” she said. “It’s nothing close to progress or what outrage would be taking place if it was a white man as the victim of this assault.” Melina Abdullah, co-founder of Black Lives Matter in Los Angeles, said she wasn’t “particularly moved” by the relatively few police who voiced outrage. ADVERTISEMENTSkip ................................................................ Abdullah said the three other officers who witnessed Chauvin’s actions and did not intervene contributed to a long-standing system of police racism and oppression against people of color. “We’ve got to remember that it was not just Officer Chauvin who was sitting on George Floyd’s neck,” she said. Abdullah and hundreds of others protested what she called Floyd’s lynching on Wednesday night. Some blocked lanes of a freeway and shattered windows of California Highway Patrol cruisers. Minneapolis is bracing for more violence after days of civil unrest, with burned buildings, looted stores and angry graffiti demanding justice. The governor on Thursday called in the National Guard. On Thursday night, protesters torched a Minneapolis police station that the department was forced to abandon. The heads of the Los Angeles and Chicago departments — both of which have been rocked before by police brutality scandals — addressed Floyd’s death and its potential effect on race relations between law enforcement and communities of color. Even the New York Police Department weighed in. Eric Garner died in the city in 2014 after he was placed in a chokehold by police and uttered the same words Floyd did: “I can’t breathe.” It took city officials five years to fire the officer, and no criminal or federal charges were brought. “What we saw in Minnesota was deeply disturbing. It was wrong,” NYPD Commissioner Dermot Shea wrote Thursday. “We must take a stand and address it. We must come together, condemn these actions and reinforce who we are as members of the NYPD. This is not acceptable ANYWHERE.” Before he was commissioner, Shea spearheaded the NYPD’s shift to community policing that moved away from a more confrontational style favored by other commissioners after Garner’s death. Harris County, Texas, Sheriff Ed Gonzalez, who also spoke out online, told The Associated Press that law enforcement agencies keep promising reforms in the wake of fatalities, but they are “not delivering it on a consistent basis.” “When bad things happen in our profession, we need to be able to call it like it is,” he said. “We keep thinking that the last one will be the last one, and then another one surfaces.”",0.0
1620032698,2020-05-29 06:13:00,Cliven Bundy Armed Standoff Case Going Back To Court,https://www.krwg.org/post/cliven-bundy-armed-standoff-case-going-back-court,en,False,,214420,krwg.org,http://krwg.org/,"It's been more than two years since Cliven Bundy left the federal courthouse in downtown Las Vegas a free man. His arm around his wife, Carol Bundy, the Nevada rancher was defiant. ""We're not done with this,"" Bundy told reporters in January 2018. ""If the federal government comes after us again we will definitely tell 'em the truth."" On Friday, the Justice Department will try to come after the Bundys again, when federal prosecutors will appeal for a retrial over a 2014 armed standoff between Bundy, his militia and federal agents who had come to round up the rancher's cows that were illegally grazing on federal land. The government's case against Cliven Bundy, his sons, Ammon and Ryan and a Montana militiaman named Ryan Payne, collapsed after a judge declared a mistrial in December 2017. Bundy and his men were accused of conspiracy against federal agents and other charges for their role in the tense standoff which later became a symbol over the fight against federal control of public lands. ""If there is no successful prosecution, it's going to encourage a lot of anarchists like the Bundys to take actions that not only are a threat to themselves but threats to the public at large,"" said Pat Shea, who served as BLM director during the Clinton administration. Retrial effort criticized For their part, the Bundys and their supporters appear puzzled that the federal government is even pursuing a retrial. ""What's really ironic and frankly I think disgusting is that the Trump Justice Department is the one that allowed the U.S. attorney in Nevada to take the appeal,"" said Larry Klayman, Cliven Bundy's attorney. After all, President Trump recently pardoned two Oregon ranchers whose fight with federal land managers inspired Cliven Bundy's son, Ammon Bundy, to lead a separate, armed takeover of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Oregon in 2016. Federal prosecutors mostly failed to get convictions in that Oregon case and have been widely criticized for bungling the Nevada trial. Judge Gloria Navarro dismissed the case and later declared a mistrial after ruling federal prosecutors ""deliberately misled"" defense attorneys and the court by failing to provide evidence from surveillance cameras and to disclose the existence of federal snipers near the ranch in the days leading up to the April 2014 standoff. The U.S. attorney's office in Nevada declined an interview request by NPR. But court filings indicate prosecutors will likely argue Friday that their missteps in the 2017 trial were ""inadvertent,"" and in particular they say they were trying to balance disclosing Bureau of Land Management surveillance footage with protecting witnesses against violence. Klayman, who is himself a controversial conservative activist and was once fixture in the ""Birther"" movement, says the DOJ is being hypocritical. He says the investigation against former Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn was recently dropped, but not his clients. ""If you're one of the Washington elite and establishment in the nation's capital, you get special treatment,"" Klayman said. ""If you're Cliven Bundy and his sons and the peaceful protesters, basically you don't."" Most of the federal agents and land managers who were at the 2014 standoff say it was anything but a peaceful protest. Photos and social media posts showed militia training their rifles on armed BLM officers who had come to round up Bundy's cattle. Cliven Bundy has refused to recognize the federal government's ownership of millions of acres of public land — including in Nevada. The rancher has consequently not paid federal fees owed for grazing his cows on land near the Lake Mead National Recreation Area since the 1990s. Pandemic ""resuscitates"" movement Retired federal land managers like Pat Shea have expressed outrage over the government's continued failure to prosecute the Bundys, whose cows continue to graze — for free — on land that's now protected as a national monument. The Bundys' original dispute over grazing goes back decades, stemming from tensions between ranchers and environmentalists and the city of Las Vegas, as it began rapidly expanding into a protected desert tortoise's habitat. Bundy was seen as the last rancher in southern Nevada who refused to get out of the business. But in the years since, his critics say the family's fight has devolved into far right extremism, and a widely debunked legal theory that counties and states, not the federal government, should own public land. ""It's like the COVID-19 virus, they mutate as to their belief system so much that you can never tell what they're going to advocate,"" Shea said. ""They are a danger to themselves and a danger to everyone else they come in contact with."" Indeed, the pandemic has lately brought an opportunity to breathe new life to the Bundys and their self-described patriot movement that had been seen as starting to fade. Ammon Bundy and some of the family's followers have been traveling across the West leading protests against coronavirus public health restrictions, protests that thus far haven't drawn huge numbers. At one recent march in Washington state that was streamed on Facebook, activist Kelli Stewart decried the business closures: ""Come on guys, this is the American way, open rebellion to tyrannical laws, we're not slaves."" A rebellious fight against tyranny, or justice against a family that has flaunted the law for decades, that's a question now before the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco. The court takes up the appeal for a retrial in USA vs. Bundy in a virtual session on Friday. ",0.0

The FBI has opened an investigation into the shooting death.Hundreds flocked downtown Thursday night, and on Friday, it happened again — people demanding justice in the death of Taylor, as well as two minority men recently killed.Details of the case remained quiet for several weeks, but gained national attention after video of the Ahmaud Arbery shooting death in Georgia was made public. Activists across the country began speaking out about the deaths of unarmed black citizens at the hands of police and/or racist white people.In March, Taylor was shot at least eight times when three officers forcibly entered her apartment to serve a search warrant in a narcotics investigation. The department said the men announced themselves and returned gunfire when Taylor's boyfriend fired at them.But in a wrongful death lawsuit, Taylor's mother says the officers didn't knock at all and should've called off their search because the suspect they sought had already been arrested.Officers didn't find drugs in her apartment when they entered, Taylor's mother said in the lawsuit.In the weeks leading up to Thursday’s violent protest, Taylor’s family called for the LMPD officers involved in the case to be relieved of their duties and charged. Activists held a candlelight vigil, a parade and a wreath-laying ceremony to bring attention to the case. The events were all held peacefully, and Taylor's mother said she would like it to remain that way. Police presence intensified around 9:45 p.m. Friday, as officers in riot gear stood shoulder-to-shoulder moving people down a key street near City Hall, the Courier Journal reported.A police officer was seen on camera during a WAVE-TV broadcast firing what appeared to be pepper bullets directly at the camera crew.“I'm getting shot! I'm getting shot!” WAVE-TV reporter Kaitlin Rust is heard yelling off-camera. She told the indignant anchors int he studio that the crew was behind the line, but police wanted them to move further away.Seven people were shot during Thursday’s rally. Two people wounded in the gunfire underwent surgery, while five were in good condition, Mayor Greg Fischer said. CNN contributed to this report.",0.0

He was pronounced dead shortly after.That officer and three others involved in the incident have been fired.'He was loved by all'Floyd, a Houston native, grew up in the city's Third Ward and graduated from Jack Yates High School where he played football, according to KTRK.He moved to Minnesota for work and to drive trucks, according to friend and former NBA player, Stephen Jackson.""He knew he had to relocate to be his best self,"" Jackson wrote on Instagram.Jackson, also a Houston native, called Floyd his twin in a second Instagram post.""The difference between me and bro was I had more opportunity than he did,"" wrote Jackson, who won a championship with the San Antonio Spurs in 2003.

For them, national security and patriotism trump the civil liberties that brought millions of Hong Kong residents into the streets last year, hoping to protect their own vision for their future — protests that would not be tolerated across the border. In the early 1980s, as China’s own economy began to open up to trade and investment after decades of Cold War isolation and political upheaval, the contrast between the mainland and Hong Kong was evident on crossing the border into the bucolic rice paddies and fish ponds of Shenzhen. Several generations later, Shenzhen is a metropolis of skyscrapers, high-tech campuses and huge, modern ports that dwarf Hong Kong’s own, at least in trading volume. Railways, roads, bridges and other infrastructure have transformed the Pearl River Delta region that surrounds it into a whole ecosystem of built-up cities that is China’s answer to Silicon Valley and then some. It also is home to increasingly influential tech companies like Huawei Technologies and Tencent. “Hong Kong is a Chinese city,” said Kenneth Courtis, an expert on Asian economies and chairman of Starfort Investment Holdings. Instead of Hong Kong transforming its neighbors in Guangdong province, he said, “it’s more likely that Hong Kong will be more and more absorbed into Guangdong.” The rise of industrial and financial centers like Shenzhen and Shanghai has sidelined Hong Kong in other respects. The city accounts for less than 3% of China’s economic activity, down from a peak of 27% in 1993, the height of its role as go-between in China’s ascent as an export powerhouse. China’s promise to leave Hong Kong’s own legal and economic systems intact for 50 years, until 2047, has helped the city of 7 million retain its attraction as a regional financial hub and bastion of Western-style civil liberties. The national security law endorsed in Beijing followed recent arrests of Hong Kong pro-democracy advocates. Critics say it will undermine civil liberties and might be used to suppress political activity, and many in Hong Kong reacted with dismay. ADVERTISEMENTSkip ................................................................ Many of the millions of Hong Kong citizens who turned out in protests that began a year ago either escaped from the mainland or have parents that left decades ago. Having fled communist rule, they are clinging to liberties forbidden in mainland China, where public dissent is treated as subversive and punishable by long prison terms. “The most frightening thing is that you will never be able to know exactly what would cross the bottom line for the Chinese Communist Party, or even where that bottom line is. No one knows,” said Philip Chan, who was walking in downtown Hong Kong’s Central district under the watchful eyes of masses of police in riot gear, a common sight nowadays. Hong Kong’s government has insisted that the new security law will only affect a small minority of people, saying that life will continue as normal for most. The city’s tycoons planted the seeds both for its success and its eventual undoing when they invested billions in Guangdong, across the border, taking advantage of special incentives and cheap labor, and eventually helping turn China into the world’s factory floor. For the most part, those ultra-wealthy elites have sought to keep the peace with Beijing in return for wielding enormous influence both in local politics and business. Billionaire Li Ka-shing, whose fortune has taken a hit over the past year as Hong Kong’s economy stumbled, told local media that he viewed Beijing’s moves as its “sovereign right.” He and his peers have voiced support for the security legislation, saying they hope it will help ensure public order. Beijing’s insistence on enacting the national security law, among other measures including now-tabled extradition legislation that sparked months of anti-government protests last year, prompted Washington to announce it no longer will treat Hong Kong as being autonomous from Beijing. It’s unclear whether the Trump administration will push ahead with the threat to no longer treat Hong Kong as an autonomous free port or how big the impact of such a move would be. ADVERTISEMENTSkip ................................................................ Hong Kong accounted for about 8% of China’s exports to the U.S. and about 6% of its imports from the U.S. in 2018, but its overall role in trade has been eclipsed by big ports to the north. The city was the world’s second-biggest port after Singapore in 2005 and now is the eighth-largest: Shanghai is by far the biggest and its throughput has doubled during that time while Hong Kong’s has fallen. The city is utterly dependent on the mainland for much of its water, most of its food, and to a large extent, tourism and investment. Before the protests and later the coronavirus pandemic virtually wiped out tourism, the city was a thriving cosmopolitan destination. It’s a shopping and dining mecca with a vibrant cultural scene, strong traditions of philanthropy and historic preservation, and mass media and educational institutions largely unfettered by Communist Party dogma and censorship. At the same time, tensions have been building as the gap between rich and poor has widened. Political sentiment has become polarized as Beijing gradually extended its influence by ensuring its supporters would hold the deciding votes over such decisions as who would be the city’s top leader. “These issues are very much central to the demonstrations,” Courtis said. “Beijing would be very smart to address some of these issues. Repression isn’t the answer.” While many in Hong Kong grew frustrated with disruptions from the anti-government protests that turned violent at times, still more have shown with the votes they are able to cast that they favor more, not less democracy. Some gathered in pop-up demonstrations Friday, including dozens who chanted in protest in the busy IFC shopping mall downtown. Jerome Lau, 70, said he feared the government would crack down on public gatherings and free speech. “Until I take my last breath, I will come out and fight for freedom,” he said. — Associated Press journalists Alice Fung and Magnum Chan in Hong Kong contributed.",0.0

In Minneapolis, where a police precinct was burned the night before, peaceful protests picked up steam as darkness fell, with thousands of people ignoring an 8 p.m. curfew to walk streets in the southern part of the city. Some cars were set on fire in scattered neighborhoods, business break-ins began and eventually there were larger fires. As a pair of restaurants and a Wells Fargo branch were set ablaze, a heavy contingent of National Guard, state troopers and police moved in, some on foot and some in vehicles. In Phoenix, Denver, Las Vegas, Los Angeles and beyond, thousands of protesters carried signs that said: “He said I can’t breathe. Justice for George.” They chanted “”No justice, no peace” and “Say his name. George Floyd.” After hours of peaceful protest in downtown Atlanta, some demonstrators suddenly turned violent, smashing police cars, setting one on fire, spray-painting the iconic logo sign at CNN headquarters, and breaking into a restaurant. The crowd pelted officers with bottles, chanting “Quit your jobs.” At least three officers were hurt and there were multiple arrests, Atlanta police spokesman Carlos Campos said. Campos said protesters shot BB guns at officers and threw bricks, bottles and knives at them. People watched the scene from rooftops, some laughing as skirmishes broke out. Bottoms passionately addressed the protesters at a news conference: “This is not a protest. This is not in the spirit of Martin Luther King Jr.” “You are disgracing our city,” she told protesters. “You are disgracing the life of George Floyd and every other person who has been killed in this country. We are better than this. We are better than this as a city. We are better than this as a country. Go home, go home.” Bottoms was flanked by rappers T.I. and Killer Mike, as well as King’s daughter, Bernice King. Killer Mike cried as he spoke. ADVERTISEMENTSkip ................................................................ “We have to be better than this moment. We have to be better than burning down our own homes. Because if we lose Atlanta what have we got?” he said. After Mayor Bottoms appealed for calm, the violence continued. More cars were set on fire, a Starbucks was smashed up, the windows of the College Football Hall of Fame were broken, and the iconic Omni Hotel was vandalized. Protesters gathered outside the White House, with President Donald Trump inside, and some tried to push through barriers set up by the U.S. Secret Service along Pennsylvania Avenue. An initially peaceful demonstration in New York City spiraled into chaos as night fell, as protesters skirmished with officers, destroyed police vehicles and set fires. In Brooklyn, activists who had marched from Manhattan chanted insults at officers lined up outside the Barclays Center and pelted them with water bottles. Police sprayed an eye-irritating chemical into the largely diverse crowd multiple times, then cleared the plaza. Video posted to social media showed officers using batons and shoving protesters down as they took people into custody and cleared streets. Demonstrators rocked a police van, set it ablaze, then scrawled graffiti across its charred hulk and set it on fire a second time as officers retreated from the area. Blocks away, protesters used a club to batter another police vehicle. Numerous people were arrested and police brought in buses to carry off those they arrested. ADVERTISEMENTSkip ................................................................ “We have a long night ahead of us in Brooklyn,” Mayor Bill de Blasio tweeted. “Our sole focus is deescalating this situation and getting people home safe. There will be a full review of what happened tonight. We don’t ever want to see another night like this.” The police department said numerous officers were injured, including one who had a tooth knocked out. The names of black people killed by police, including Floyd and Eric Garner, who died on Staten Island in 2014, were on signs carried by those in the crowd, and in their chants. “It’s my duty to be out here,” said Brianna Petrisko, among those at Foley Square in lower Manhattan, where most were wearing masks amid the coronavirus pandemic. “Our country has a sickness. We have to be out here. This is the only way we’re going to be heard.” In Houston, where George Floyd grew up, several thousand people rallied in front of City Hall. Among them was 19-year-old Jimmy Ohaz, who came from the nearby city of Richmond, Texas. “My question is how many more, how many more? I just want to live in a future where we all live in harmony and we’re not oppressed.” Tensions rose in several West Coast cities as night fell and protesters blocked highways in Los Angeles and Oakland. About 1,000 protesters gathered in Oakland. They smashed windows, sprayed buildings with “Kill Cops” graffiti and were met with chemical spray from police. Oakland Police were notifying a crowd that the demonstrationwas an unlawful assembly. Authorities said officers were injured when projectiles were thrown and that they were asking people to leave the area. Demonstrators in Los Angeles scuffled at times with police, with a few protesters detained and one officer receiving medical treatment, police said. An LAPD vehicle had its windows smashed, and CNN reported that someone wrote “killer” on a patrol car. Protesters repeatedly clashed with police in the Silicon Valley city of San Jose, said Mayor Sam Liccardo, and police responded with flash-bang grenades and rubber bullets. One officer was being treated at a hospital for an injury that was not life-threatening, he and police officials said. Liccardo said his own officers shared the community’s outrage over Floyd’s in-custody death. “It was a horrible injustice. I’d venture to guess that every police officer out there feels much of the same anger about what happened in Minneapolis,” he told The Associated Press. Thirty miles to the west, Santa Cruz police chief Andrew G. Mills said in a statement that the actions by Minneapolis officers in Floyd’s death “are the antithesis of what we view as good policing.”",0.0

With more rallies planned, Taylor’s mother joined the chorus of calls for protests to remain peaceful. In her statement, Tamika Palmer said her daughter — an emergency medical technician — devoted her life to others and the “last thing she’d want right now is any more violence.” “Please keep saying her name,” her statement said. “Please keep demanding justice and accountability, but let’s do it the right way without hurting each other. We can and we will make some real change here. Now is the time. Let’s make it happen, but safely.” On Friday evening, what appeared to be several hundred people gathered downtown for the second night of protests. The crowd briefly blocked traffic near City Hall and chanted, “No justice, no peace.” Protesters carried signs calling for justice for Breonna Taylor and George Floyd, the black man who died after a Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck for several minutes even after he stopped moving and pleading for air. Police presence intensified around 9:45 p.m. Friday, as officers in riot gear stood shoulder-to-shoulder moving people down a key street near City Hall, the Courier Journal reported.

She told the indignant anchors int he studio that the crew was behind the line, but police wanted them to move further away. Police spokeswoman Jessie Halladay said no shots had been fired at Friday’s protest as of 10:40 p.m. and no significant injuries had been reported. Two people were arrested. ADVERTISEMENTSkip ................................................................ Bracing for more protests, police said they wouldn’t tolerate violence or property destruction. “We value the right to free speech and understand this community has a lot to say right now,” Louisville police Lt. Col. LaVita Chavous said. “We hear you.” But she added that police were prepared to “take whatever action we must to try to ensure no one else is injured during this time of unrest. We ask the community to please voice your opinions in a peaceful way.” Meanwhile, Louisville’s mayor said the use of no-knock warrants by police was being suspended, the latest in a series of policy changes and others actions in response to Taylor’s death. “To the people who gathered downtown last night to protest, and to many more throughout our city and throughout our country who feel angry, hurt, afraid, frustrated, tired and sick of story after story of black lives ending at the hands of law enforcement, I hear you,” Fischer said. Two people wounded in the gunfire underwent surgery, while five were in good condition, he said. Beshear, speaking on CNN, said Thursday’s protest started peacefully but some people later “turned it into something that it should not have been.” Local Councilwoman Keisha Dorsey termed the protest as “a revolt against a system in which people have felt oppressed,” the Courier Journal reported. “What I’m seeing is people who are trying their best to do something with their hurt, their pain and their frustration.” ADVERTISEMENTSkip ................................................................ The Louisville protests followed the release of a 911 call Taylor’s boyfriend made on March 13, moments after the 26-year-old EMT was shot eight times by narcotics detectives who knocked down her front door. No drugs were found in the home. Hundreds of demonstrators marched through downtown Louisville, ending in the early hours of Friday as rain poured down. Windows were broken and several vehicles were damaged during the unrest, police said. Shots were fired into government buildings, including police headquarters, they said. Bricks were thrown into buildings and graffiti was splashed in several places, including a firefighter memorial, they said. The police description of the damage made no reference to any looting. Jordan Basham, a 24-year-old white bartender, said she was a few feet from where the people were shot. As people fled in terror, a man she didn’t know pushed her to the ground, told her not to move and used his own body to shield her, she said Friday. “I’ll never be able to get that picture out of my mind,” she said. “But I am still very glad that I was there. As long as they’re out there protesting, I’ll be back.” Many protesters wore masks as Kentuckians are strongly urged to follow health guidelines to contain the coronavirus pandemic. Attention on Taylor’s death has intensified since her family sued the police department this month. The case has attracted national headlines alongside the shooting of Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia in February and the recent death of Floyd.",0.0
1620308127,2020-05-29 13:04:36,Trump adds fuel to protest fires with denounced tweet,https://www.abqjournal.com/1460723/trump-calls-minneapolis-protesters-thugs-vows-action.html,en,False,,99,Albuquerque Journal ,http://www.abqjournal.com/,".......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump spent Friday walking back his post-midnight “thugs” tweet about Minneapolis protesters that added to outrage over the police killing of a black man. Trump’s later repeated condemnation of the killing and outreach to the man’s family was a marked change in tone from his earlier comments that also invoked a civil-rights-era phrase fraught with racist overtones. “When the looting starts, the shooting starts,” Trump had written in a tweet that was quickly flagged by Twitter as violating rules against “glorifying violence.” Trump later said his comments had been misconstrued. “Frankly it means when there’s looting, people get shot and they die,” he said. ADVERTISEMENTSkip ................................................................ Trump’s whiplash comments came after protesters torched a Minneapolis police station on Thursday night, capping three days of searing demonstrations over the death of George Floyd, who was captured on video pleading for air as a white police officer knelt on his neck for over eight minutes. And they underscored Trump’s complicated relationship with race as he tries to maintain a law-and-order mantle while looking to appeal to black voters during an election year. They also highlighted his refusal to avoid controversy or cede the spotlight even as the battered nation tries to make sense of another killing and reels over the mounting COVID-19 death toll. Trump, in his tweets, borrowed a phrase once used by former Miami Police Chief Walter Headley in a 1967 speech outlining his department’s efforts to “combat young hoodlums who have taken advantage of the civil rights campaign.” In the speech, Headley said his department had been successful “because I’ve let the word filter down that when the looting starts, the shooting starts.” “We don’t mind being accused of police brutality,” he said in the same speech, according to news reports from the time. Trump, after hours of backlash, said Friday evening that he was unaware of the origins of the phrase. “But I’ve heard it for a long time, as most people have. And frankly it means when there’s looting, people get shot and they die,” he said. Trump also revealed that he had been in touch with Floyd’s family as he continued to denounce the circumstances of the man’s killing, which he called “a terrible insult to police and to policemen.” “I just expressed my sorrow,” Trump told reporters. “He was in tremendous pain, obviously, and couldn’t breathe. And it was very obvious to anybody that watched it.” Still, Trump called on protesters to keep their demonstrations peaceful. ADVERTISEMENTSkip ................................................................ “The family of George is entitled to justice, and the people of Minnesota are entitled to live in safety,” he said. “Law and order will prevail.” Criticism of the Trump’s tweet had been swift, with his presumptive Democratic presidential rival Joe Biden saying it was “no time for incendiary tweets, no time to incite violence.” “It’s not helpful,” said Minnesota’s Democratic Gov. Tim Walz. “Anything we do to add fuel to that fire is really, really challenging.” Rep. Emmanuel Cleaver, D-Mo., said that, as the country passed the grim milestone of more than 100,000 COVID-19 deaths, Trump had missed a chance to help the public cope with “two viruses: One is the coronavirus and the other is the virus of racial animus.” Trump has been accused of stoking racial tensions and exploiting divisions for personal gain since long before he ran for president, beginning with the full-page ads he ran in 1989 calling for the death penalty for the Central Park Five, five young men of color who were wrongly convicted of assaulting a white jogger. Trump — who rarely holds his tongue — has been silent in the face of a long list of high-profile killings by police of black men, including Eric Garner, who was placed in a chokehold and whose dying words, “I can’t breathe,” became a rallying cry for the Black Lives Matter movement. (Trump has instead invoked those words on several occasions to mock political rivals, even bringing his hands to his neck for dramatic effect.) He spent years railing against NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick and other players for kneeling during the National Anthem to protest racial injustice and police brutality. And in one speech he appeared to advocate rougher treatment of people in custody, speaking dismissively of the police practice of shielding the heads of handcuffed suspects as they are being placed in patrol cars. At the same time, Trump and his campaign have tried to make inroads with black Americans, particularly after Biden suggested last week that black voters who support Trump “ain’t black.” A bedrock of the Democratic base, black Americans are unlikely to embrace Trump en masse, but his campaign believes even a marginal shift could make a difference — and send a message to white voters uneasy about the president’s charged rhetoric. Meanwhile, the unrest complicates the Trump campaign’s plans for Minnesota, one of the key swing states he hopes to win in November. Twitter’s decision to flag Trump’s tweet — the second time it has acted this week — came a day after he signed an executive order challenging the social media giant’s protections against lawsuits as he accuses it of stifling conservative voices. The warning label prevented the tweet from being shared or liked, though it could still be viewed by users. The White House, trying to skirt the blockage, reposted the message on its own official Twitter account Friday morning. Twitter quickly flagged that tweet, too, accusing the White House of promoting violence. Supporters of the president balked at the move. Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale accused the media, Biden and other Democrats of “purposefully misrepresenting what the President had said, and showing once again that they are incapable of resisting their base impulse of dividing Americans, solely for the purpose of political gain, ratings, and cable news profit.”",0.0

But it falls on all of us, regardless of our race or station — including the majority of men and women in law enforcement who take pride in doing their tough job the right way, every day — to work together to create a ""new normal"" in which the legacy of bigotry and unequal treatment no longer infects our institutions or our hearts.

(AP Photo/Julio Cortez) NEW YORK (AP) — It had been a tense, challenging Thursday evening in the riot-torn Twin Cities for Associated Press photographer Julio Cortez. Midnight was fast approaching, and so was a lone protester carrying an upside-down U.S. flag. Aware of the flag’s power as a visual symbol, Cortez followed the man down the rubble-strewn street and took a photograph that soon rocketed around the world – the protester silhouetted against the flames of a burning liquor store, the light of the fire glowing through the fabric of the flag. Taken at 11:59 p.m. and transmitted a few moments later, it swiftly went viral — perhaps the most indelible image yet of the racial divisions and violent protests flaring after the death of George Floyd, a handcuffed black man who pleaded for air as a white Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck. TV networks featured it on their newscasts. Twitter at one point used it to lead its “What’s Happening” page. Multiple commentators on social media depicted it as “Picture of the Year.” Cortez had sensed an opportunity as soon as he saw the flag-bearer approach – photojournalists know that flags have distinctive symbolic power, as evidenced by the famous photograph of flag-raising Marines at Iwo Jima. “I didn’t think of it as a contest winner,” Cortez said of his photo. “I thought it told a story.” Cortez, based in Baltimore for the AP, had arrived in the Twin Cities on Thursday afternoon, along with New York-based AP photographer John Minchillo. They spent about three hours covering unrest in St. Paul, then shifted to Minneapolis after hearing there was a new outbreak of trouble at a police precinct house there. “We’d been working that scene for about two hours when this particular moment happened,” Cortez said. “The police abandoned the precinct — there was just chaos and fires and people throwing stuff.” Minchillo then relocated, having been asked to provide some video footage. Cortez stayed near the precinct house, though growing uneasy as word spread that a gas line had been severed and might explode. “When I saw the man walking up with the flag, I started getting closer,” he said. “I could tell this was going to be very visual, so I just followed along. I wanted to silhouette him, so I waited for him to walk where it was burning.” David Ake, AP’s director of photography, said Cortez’ photo was powerful on many levels. “The upside-down flag is the universal signal of distress and is framed perfectly and backlit by the flames in the background adding to the urgency of the distress,” he said “One foot in either direction and the image would lose that backlight and lose the impact.” Ake also noted that the person holding the flag is unrecognizable. “It could be any person of any age, race, or gender,” he said. “It could be you or me.” Cortez has been with the AP nearly 10 years, including a previous posting in New Jersey. Among his many assignments, he remembers a similar feeling of uncertainty and risk covering the aftermath of the Boston Marathon bombing in 2013 when the city was locked down due to a manhunt for the suspects.",0.0

1620561515,2020-05-29 19:59:32,Live updates: George Floyd protests grow in cities across the U.S.,https://www.krqe.com/rd/news-share/live-updates-george-floyd-protests-grow-in-cities-across-the-u-s/,en,False,,662160,KRQE,https://www.krqe.com/,"ATLANTA (AP) — Demonstrators marched, stopped traffic and in some cases lashed out violently at police as protests erupted Friday in dozens of U.S. cities following the killing of George Floyd after a white officer pressed a knee into his neck while taking him into custody in Minnesota. In Phoenix, Denver, Las Vegas, Los Angeles and beyond, thousands of protesters carried signs that said: “He said I can’t breathe. Justice for George.” They chanted ”“No justice, no peace” and “Say his name. George Floyd.” After hours of peaceful protest in downtown Atlanta, some demonstrators suddenly turned violent, smashing police cars, setting one on fire, spray-painting the iconic logo sign at CNN headquarters, and breaking into a restaurant. The crowd pelted officers with bottles, chanting “Quit your jobs.” At least three officers were hurt and there were multiple arrests, Atlanta police spokesman Carlos Campos said in an emailed statement. Campos said protesters shot BB guns at officers and threw bricks, bottles and knives at them. People watched the scene from rooftops, some laughing as skirmishes broke out. Demonstrators ignored police demands to disperse. Some protesters moved to the city’s major interstate thoroughfare to try to block traffic. Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms passionately addressed the protesters at a news conference: “This is not a protest. This is not in the spirit of Martin Luther King Jr.” “You are disgracing our city,” she told protesters. “You are disgracing the life of George Floyd and every other person who has been killed in this country. We are better than this. We are better than this as a city. We are better than this as a country. Go home, go home.” Bottoms was flanked by rappers T.I. and Killer Mike, as well as King’s daughter, Bernice King. Killer Mike cried as he spoke. “We have to be better than this moment. We have to be better than burning down our own homes. Because if we lose Atlanta what have we got?” he said. After Mayor Bottoms appealed for calm, the violence continued. More cars were set on fire, a Starbucks was smashed up, the windows of the College Football Hall of Fame were broken, and the iconic Omni Hotel was vandalized. In Minneapolis, a curfew did little to stop protesters and others from gathering in several areas of the city, including the battered Lake Street neighborhood where a police precinct was burned the night before. There were scattered small fires and some stores in a strip mall were being broken into near the city’s 5th Precinct. An initially peaceful demonstration in New York City spiraled into chaos as night fell, as protesters skirmished with officers, destroyed police vehicles and set fires. In Brooklyn, activists who had marched from Manhattan chanted insults at officers lined up outside the Barclays Center and pelted them with water bottles. Police sprayed an eye-irritating chemical into the largely diverse crowd multiple times, then cleared the plaza. Video posted to social media showed officers using batons and shoving protesters down as they took people into custody and cleared streets. Demonstrators rocked a police van, set it ablaze, then scrawled graffiti across its charred hulk and set it on fire a second time as officers retreated from the area. Blocks away, protesters used a club to batter another police vehicle. Numerous people were arrested and police brought in buses to take away prisoners. “We have a long night ahead of us in Brooklyn,” Mayor Bill de Blasio tweeted. “Our sole focus is deescalating this situation and getting people home safe. There will be a full review of what happened tonight. We don’t ever want to see another night like this.” The police department said numerous officers were injured, including one who had a tooth knocked out. The names of black people killed by police, including Floyd and Eric Garner, who died on Staten Island in 2014, were on signs carried by those in the crowd, and in their chants. “It’s my duty to be out here,” said Brianna Petrisko, among those at Foley Square in lower Manhattan, where most were wearing masks amid the coronavirus pandemic. “Our country has a sickness. We have to be out here. This is the only way we’re going to be heard.” In Houston, where George Floyd grew up, several thousand people rallied in front of City Hall. Police had apparently taken into custody a woman who had a rifle and had tried to use it to incite the crowd. Jimmy Ohaz, 19, came from the nearby city of Richmond, Texas. “My question is how many more, how many more? I just want to live in a future where we all live in harmony and we’re not oppressed.” See updates from earlier in the evening below (all times ET).

A CBP statement issued Friday says the drone would have provided “situational awareness” to local law enforcement. It said it routinely conducts such operations if needed to help other agencies or during natural disasters. The drone returned to its base in Grand Forks, North Dakota, after “the requesting agency determined that the aircraft was no longer needed for operational awareness.” CBP did not identify the agency that requested the assistance. 7:52 p.m. CNN Center in Atlanta Police cars getting literally destroyed in Atlanta outside the CNN Center pic.twitter.com/x5zRxZVQpb — Fernando Alfonso III (@fernalfonso) May 29, 2020 SWAT pushing in in ATL, CNN Center vandalized and has had windows smashed pic.twitter.com/EgMrEaYCTB — intelwave ⚓️ (@inteldotwav) May 29, 2020 Atlanta protesters burn American flag in front of CNN Center #GeorgeFloyddeath pic.twitter.com/89FLqW0GYt — ivan (@ivan8848) May 29, 2020 7:41 p.m. New York City protesters reach CNN The Associated Press contributed to this report.",0.0

Las Cruces Sun-News MINNEAPOLIS – Days of civil unrest in the Twin Cities have followed the death of George Floyd, 46, who died May 25, while in police custody. Former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, who is white, was arrested Friday, days after video circulated of him holding his knee to Floyd's neck for at least eight minutes before Floyd, who is black, died. Chauvin is facing third-degree murder and manslaughter charges. Subsequent charges are possible and charges for the other officers involved are anticipated, according to Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman. The disturbing incident, which was caught on video, happened in front of a Cup Foods at the intersection of Chicago Avenue and 38th Street in south Minneapolis. In the video, Floyd can be heard saying, ""I can't breathe."" Buy Photo About 80 businesses were damaged or burned down on East Lake Street in south Minneapolis, Minnesota. The damage occurred in the wake of the May 25, 2020 death of George Floyd, who died after a Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck for several minutes in an incident caught on cellphone video. (Photo: Jacqueline Devine/Sun-News) Protests, some violent, cropped up across the nation. In Minneapolis, residents awoke Friday to smoke billowing, fires burning and police lining their streets after an intense night of protests. While many focused on looting, riots and angry protesters Thursday night, there was a different setting at the site where Floyd died — a community of people grieving. They gathered for a vigil to remember their friend and to support his family during these trying times. Floyd was a 'fine fella' Hundreds of mourners and peaceful protesters gathered at a makeshift memorial in front of the Cup Foods as speakers remembered Floyd. ""I met him (Floyd) before. He was a fine fella when we met,"" said Elton Wright, who works building stages for concerts and has lived in the city for 30 years. ""I remember his name. So, when I heard on the news, I didn’t even need to see his picture. So, that’s why I’m here."" Wright said Floyd's death shook him to his core. ""Tears came out of my eyes. From there on, it was just horrible."" Wright, 63, said he's not a fan of the violent protests and called for all races to come together. ""We need to keep on living and stick together,"" he said. ""We’re going to live together the rest of our lives. It doesn’t matter what color you are, you have to get over it. It’s too much."" Community uses art to protest Building walls, vehicles and even the street itself became canvases for protesters to spray-paint messages, some seeking justice, some promoting violence. Some businesses put up signs that read ""black owned"" or ""minority owned"" in hopes rioters and looters would leave them alone. But also beautiful murals honoring Floyd have gone up in Powderhorn, the neighborhood where he lived. Greta Mclaine, a lifelong resident of the Powderhorn neighborhood, on Thursday picked up a paint brush and along with other artists contributed to a mural going up on the wall of the Cup Foods near where Floyd was pinned down. ""As community muralists and painters, this is our tool for protest for making change and for celebrating George Floyd’s life and what he represents,"" Mclaine said. Buy Photo A group of artists honor George Floyd by painting a mural on the wall of the Cup Foods at the corner of 38th Street and Chicago Avenue south in Minneapolis on Thursday, May 28, 2020. Artists began work on the mural that morning. (Photo: Jacqueline Devine/Sun-News) Mclaine said police brutality against people of color can no longer be ignored and society as a whole needs to change. ""Minneapolis considers itself very liberal and very progressive and the fact that this happened right here right in Powderhorn, it just struck home,"" Mclaine said. ""This is a huge systemic problem and it’s something that we all carry inside ourselves. We are part of the system and so we all have to do a deep dive now."" Breaking the cycle Brandon Royce-Diop, another community member, said part of the reason he attended the vigil was education. ""Part of the reason I'm here is to keep young men out of trouble, protect as many people as I can, and make sure police understand my perspective when I talk to them one on one,"" Diop said. ""They (police) don’t say much but I've looked them in the eye and told them how I feel and what I think and I believe changes in the heart need to happen in order for these types of things to change."" Diop said he's aware of many black men who have been killed by police and said the cycle needs to stop. Buy Photo Hundreds gather at a vigil held Thursday, May 28, 2020, in front of the store where George Floyd, 46, died in the custody of police at the intersection of 38th Street and Chicago Avenue in Minneapolis, Minnesota. (Photo: Jacqueline Devine/Sun-News) ""This was one of the most gruesome and unnecessary and intentional ways I've seen police kill a black man,"" Diop said. ""To me it’s a lynching, and 100 years ago when they used to lynch a black man the entire community would come out to watch. So, I see this as a reversal of that, us demanding justice."" Diop said he is not surprised at the outburst of anger. ""This isn’t the first time, but we want to make sure it’s the last,"" he said. ""It’s a natural response to our condition. I don’t blame anybody. I think there's many ways people express their anger, anguish and sadness. As we’ve learned from history, until things change this is going to happen.""

Civil unrest has also been apparent in other metropolitan areas across the country as angry citizens speak out about Floyd and other recent incidents of racism and police shootings. The first protester Russell Bell said he wept when he saw the video of Floyd's death. A black man who grew up in Waterloo, Iowa, Bell said he's been dealing with racism his entire life.

Other bottles thrown at authorities exploded behind the police line, but no officers appeared to get hit. Protesters chanted, “Quit your jobs.” The officers backed their line away from the group of protesters who were throwing objects at them. Police ordered demonstrators to leave the street and threatened to arrest them if they did not leave quickly. Protesters used accelerant to burn an American flag. People were watching the scene from rooftops, some laughing at skirmishes that broke out and vandalism by the protesters. Protesters were also walking on the interstate in downtown Atlanta and appeared to be trying to block traffic. The Georgia State Patrol has responded. Earlier, as the protest appeared more calm, Kaity Brackett, 27, said she came out to the protest because she thinks the entire criminal justice system needs to be overhauled, starting with policing. She said the Ahmaud Arbery killing was a catalyst for her and referred to his death as a lynching. Arbery was killed on Feb. 23 by a former district attorney investigator and his son, who were not arrested until after video emerged months later.

A tweet from 511 Hampton Roads around 9 p.m. said all eastbound lanes on Interstate 64 were blocked. Police confirmed an “incident” going eastbound shut down the tunnel. Both directions of traffic were released by 10:10 p.m. Protesters could be seen on the livestream shutting down the westbound lanes of the interstate as well. The protesters shut down the interstate for nearly nine minutes starting around 9 p.m. to represent how long Floyd went without air. During those nine minutes, protesters chanted “Black Lives Matter” and “I can’t breathe” while standing among the stopped cars on I-64 near the Mallory Street exit. “I can’t breathe” were some of Floyd’s last words, which were captured on a widely-circulated video on the internet. After stopping traffic, protesters gathered on Mallory Street and chanted “No peace, no sleep” followed by a moment of silence remembering those who died at the hands of police, from suicide or from gun violence. After shutting down the interstate, protesters went to Peninsula Town Center to continue the protest. By 11:20 p.m., Hampton Police were playing a message on a loudspeaker around the intersection of Power Plant Way and Mercury Boulevard saying the gathering had been determined to be unlawful. Police asked the group to disperse. The road was also blocked to traffic. Some officers could be seen with shields and helmets.

Protests were largely peaceful as demonstrators marched in the streets from Los Angeles to New York, but in Atlanta, demonstrators set a police car ablaze and broke windows at CNN’s headquarters. Protesters used barricades to break police vehicle windshields and jumped from car to car in Atlanta. Hundreds of the protesters confronted police outside CNN headquarters. They spray-painted the large, iconic CNN logo outside the building, breaking a windowed entrance. One protester climbed on top of the sign and waved a “Black Lives Matter” flag to cheers from the crowd.

Other bottles thrown at authorities exploded behind the police line, but no officers appeared to get hit. Protesters chanted, “Quit your jobs.” The officers backed their line away from the group of protesters who were throwing objects at them. Police ordered demonstrators to leave the street and threatened to arrest them if they did not leave quickly. Protesters used accelerant to burn an American flag. People were watching the scene from rooftops, some laughing at skirmishes that broke out and vandalism by the protesters. Protesters were also walking on the interstate in downtown Atlanta and appeared to be trying to block traffic. The Georgia State Patrol has responded. Earlier, as the protest appeared more calm, Kaity Brackett, 27, said she came out to the protest because she thinks the entire criminal justice system needs to be overhauled, starting with policing. She said the Ahmaud Arbery killing was a catalyst for her and referred to his death as a lynching. Arbery was killed on Feb. 23 by a former district attorney investigator and his son, who were not arrested until after video emerged months later.

There’s been a protest and a police chief is speaking out. Farmington Police Chief Steven Hebbe says it’s time for leaders to be more vocal about what they won’t tolerate otherwise nothing will change. From the streets of Minneapolis, all the way to southeast Albuquerque, it’s clear that protesters and even law enforcement are desperate for change. “We can’t let stuff like that happen repeatedly,” Chief Hebbe says. He says after watching the video of then Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin kneel on George Floyd’s neck, who later died, he had to speak out. “From a leadership perspective, a law enforcement perspective, we’ve got to come out and be more verbal about what we tolerate and what we don’t and we don’t tolerate what we see in that video,” Hebbe says. Hebbe took to Facebook saying that quote “If we as law enforcement leaders cannot plainly condemn this kind of event, we are failing our profession, our officers and our communities.” “We’ve certainly had our blunders so I’m not condemning any one department but I am talking about us as a profession and us owning the stuff that we do and then pledging to fix it,” Hebbe says. Albuquerque Police Chief Mike Geier echoed Hebbe’s statement following a black lives matter protest Thursday night, where 400 people shut down parts of Central Avenue in Albuquerque. “We will not tolerate these actions and denounce this type of police brutality. The senseless misconduct demonstrated in this unfortunate incident should not define other police departments across,” Geier says. Chief Geier says as the first wave of protestors cleared out a larger group came in around 10 p.m. One of their female sergeants was attacked while she was in her patrol car. protestors surrounded her car and broke the windows. The sergeant was able to escape unharmed. Police also say a group of people fired multiple gunshots from a car. Chief Hebbe says it’s going to take leaders using their platform to make a difference. “Hopefully we can change things for the better and keep a good relationship with our communities,” Chief Hebbe says. He also says his department has a use of a force review unit to hold officers accountable. Albuquerque Police arrested four people in connection with the gunshots but those four were released as police continued their investigation. Related Coverage:",0.0

Harold Medina, a deputy chief with the Albuquerque Police Department, said no injuries were reported in the scuffle, but windows were broken out of several police vehicles and four people were detained for allegedly firing guns. All were later released “pending further investigation.” Many of the questions leveled during the news conference revolved around APD’s actions: whether officers used excessive force; if they escalated the situation by wearing riot gear; and if they lawfully detained the four people accused of firing shots. But Mayor Tim Keller defended the actions taken by the department. “Dozens of shots were fired and APD absolutely had to respond,” Keller said during a morning news conference. “They did it in a way that fortunately kept everyone safe and, while I know it was scary for many, it was also dangerous for many.” As they praised the response of APD, Keller, APD staff and others also took the opportunity to denounce the actions of the Minneapolis police officers that led to Floyd’s death. “My words can’t capture the depth of the pain that so many people, especially people of color, are experiencing right now,” Keller said. “As your mayor, I want to acknowledge that pain. Here in Albuquerque, we stand with those grieving these incidents around the nation. We stand with those calling for justice.” Floyd was handcuffed and could be heard telling officers he could not breathe. Video of the incident, which was recorded by a bystander, has gone viral, sparking protests across the country. “Those officers’ actions are inconsistent with the training and protocols of our department. APD has worked tirelessly to build trust between law enforcement and the community here,” APD Chief Mike Geier said. “What occurred in Minneapolis is an unfortunate reminder of how quickly bad policing can erode that trust.” ADVERTISEMENTSkip ................................................................ APD is no stranger to controversy and has suffered its own black eyes when it comes to unconstitutional policing. The department is currently undergoing a yearslong review and reform process, spurred by a Department of Justice investigation following several high-profile killings by police officers – particularly the killing of James Boyd in 2014. But, on Friday morning, Geier and Keller both emphasized how far the department has come since those days. They said restraint shown by APD officers during the incidents Thursday night illustrates that. In a rundown of the incident, Geier said the 400 people involved in the initial Albuquerque protest, which started at Central and Wyoming around 6 p.m., dispersed after marching along Central as they waved signs and chanted through a loudspeaker. Then, around 10 p.m., a second “more aggressive” group showed up at Central and Wyoming with “different intentions.” He said the majority of officers stayed back to avoid a confrontation as undercover officers watched members of the group spray painting bus stations, vandalizing civilian vehicles and even surrounding a female officer’s vehicle before breaking the windows while she was inside. Geier said the situation escalated as a group of people drove around the area and repeatedly fired off rounds. That’s when APD intervened, stopping the suspected vehicle a few blocks away at Mesilla and Central, and taking four people, some of them juveniles, into custody. ADVERTISEMENTSkip ................................................................ He said a group of protesters surrounded police as they collected evidence from the vehicle, leading dozens of officers clad in riot gear who were staged nearby and an armored vehicle, to move in. Within the hour, a large crowd of protesters had gathered on Mesilla, just north of Central, to face off against a line of officers clad in riot gear and wielding batons. The protesters waved signs and yelled “I can’t breathe” and “(expletive) the police” as they paced a few feet from the officers. Some people recorded the confrontation with their phones from a distance, documenting the event over social media, as others blocked the end of the street with their vehicles. The line of riot police began to load onto city buses as a helicopter shined its spotlight onto the gathering and told the crowd to disperse in between blasts of a siren. At that point, at least three gas canisters were fired into the crowd by the retreating officers. A man began throwing the canisters back at the officers as the crowd ran back toward Central. Protesters gathered around a woman who appeared to be injured, but it was unclear by what. Although much of the crowd dispersed, Medina said it didn’t quite end there. He said someone in the area drove away in the vehicle that police had initially stopped containing the four shooting suspects. Officers followed the vehicle, alongside a couple of car loads of protesters, to the university area, where it was abandoned. Police tried to arrest the driver when he got into another vehicle, but a group of protesters came to his defense. Officers let the man go to prevent another confrontation.",0.0

SANTA FE – About 250 people amassed at the state Capitol late Friday afternoon for a peaceful protest, joining hundreds of thousands of people across the country demonstrating against the killing of George Floyd, a black man who died at the hands of white police officers in Minneapolis on Monday. The demonstration, organized through social media, came a day after protesters in Minneapolis set fire to a police station and other buildings, resulting in the National Guard being deployed. That same night in Albuquerque, police in riot gear used tear gas in a confrontation with protesters and several arrests were made. A New Mexico State Police helicopter circled overhead at the Santa Fe demonstration. ADVERTISEMENTSkip ................................................................ Santa Fe police showed up briefly after protesters took to the streets and marched to the downtown plaza and back, but left soon thereafter. After most of the crowd dispersed, about 50 protesters lingered and continued the demonstration at the intersection of Paseo de Peralta and Old Santa Fe Trail, shouting at passing vehicles, some of which answered back by honking their horns. “I think everyone has had enough. There needs to be change,” said 17-year-old Abby Bay, one of the people who spread the word about the protest on Facebook. “What happened in Minneapolis, it could happen anywhere, even here.” Lacking an organizer, several people stepped up to lead the crowd in chants of “black lives matter” and “I can’t breathe,” the latter words spoken by Floyd as a Minneapolis police officer pressed him to the ground with a knee to his neck. “We’re standing up for the injustices against black people,” said Lonnica Montoya, who led most of the chants. At one point, Montoya read the names of several dozen black citizens who have died at the hands of police. Another woman, Amy Linquist, led the protesters in a song called “Somebody’s Hurting My Brother,” which she said grew out of the Poor People’s Campaign. Protesters also carried signs, some reading “There’s power in Unity” and “Complacency = Complicity.” Holding a sign that said “I can’t breathe,” Derrick Gomez was one of fewer than a dozen African Americans at the demonstration. ADVERTISEMENTSkip ................................................................ “What’s going on in Minneapolis with the riots and looting, and in Albuquerque with police and their guns, we’re here with just signs,” he said. “We have to stand up for what we believe in.” Gomez, who grew up in Santa Fe, where fewer than 1% of people identify as black or African American, said he’s experienced racism all his life. “It’s great to see the diversity here, especially here in New Mexico, where our culture is rich,” he said. “It’s moving that people here do care.” Gomez said he hoped the protests being held across the country will make a difference and change attitudes about racism in America. “As long as we continue, they have to listen to us at some point,” he said. “The moment we quit is the moment they win.”",0.0

More than 500 mourners wearing masks against the coronavirus packed a Houston church a little more than two weeks after Floyd was pinned to the pavement by a white Minneapolis police officer who put a knee on his neck for what prosecutors said was 8 minutes and 46 seconds. Cellphone video of the encounter, including Floyd’s pleas of “I can’t breathe,” ignited protests and scattered violence across the U.S. and around the world, turning the 46-year-old Floyd — a man who in life was little known beyond the public housing project where he was raised in Houston’s Third Ward — into a worldwide symbol of injustice. “Third Ward, Cuney Homes, that’s where he was born at,” Floyd’s brother, Rodney, told mourners at the Fountain of Praise church. “But everybody is going to remember him around the world. He is going to change the world.” The funeral capped six days of mourning for Floyd in three cities: Raeford, North Carolina, near where he was born; Houston, where he grew up; and Minneapolis, where he died. The memorials have drawn the families of other black victims whose names have become familiar in the debate over race and justice — among them, Eric Garner, Michael Brown, Ahmaud Arbery and Trayvon Martin. ___ Trump eyes racial equality debate through economic lens WASHINGTON (AP) — In his comments since George Floyd died, President Donald Trump has shared lots of opinions about the need for “law and order,” about fighting crime and the dangerous ideas of the “liberal left.” When it comes to addressing racism, not so much. Trump has remained largely silent on that, except to argue that a strong economy is the best antidote. He insists he’s “done more for the black community than any president since Abraham Lincoln.” But the lack of substantive discussion of racism by the White House has opened the president to criticism that he has failed to show leadership during the unrest following Floyd’s death and has inflamed the situation with his “law and order” mantra and tweets about looting and shooting, vicious dogs and ominous weapons. Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, a Democrat, says Trump’s relative silence on racism and harsh rhetoric toward protesters have created a confounding dynamic for a consequential national conversation. “I think we have to have the conversation with him being absent,” Bottoms said. “Having a conversation with him would be like having a conversation with a madman. It would mean nothing.” ___ Heat, rain, long lines: Georgia election plagued by problems ATLANTA (AP) — Voters endured heat, pouring rain and waits as long as five hours on Tuesday to cast ballots in Georgia, demonstrating a fierce desire to participate in the democratic process while raising questions about the emerging battleground state’s ability to manage elections in November when the White House is at stake. “It’s really disheartening to see a line like this in an area with predominantly black residents,” said Benaiah Shaw, a 25-year-old African American, as he cast a ballot in Atlanta. A confluence of events disrupted primary elections for president, U.S. Senate and dozens of other contests. There were problems with Georgia’s new voting machines, which combine touchscreens with scanned paper ballots. The polls were staffed by fewer workers because of coronavirus concerns. A reduced workforce contributed to officials consolidating polling places, which disproportionately affected neighborhoods with high concentrations of people of color. Long lines were also reported in whiter suburban areas. Some voters said they requested mail-in ballots that never arrived, forcing them to go to polling places and adding to the lines. Turnout, meanwhile, may be higher than expected as voters said they were determined to exercise their constitutional right after the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis and the ensuing demonstrations that swept cities including Atlanta. Former Vice President Joe Biden easily won the state’s Democratic presidential primary. He was facing no real opposition but hoped to post a strong showing among Georgia’s diverse electorate to show his strength heading into the general election. ___ Video evidence increasingly disproves police narratives Minneapolis police initially told the public that George Floyd died after a “medical incident during a police interaction.” The Buffalo, New York, department said a protester “tripped and fell.” Philadelphia police alleged that a college student who suffered a serious head wound had assaulted an officer. All three claims were quickly disproved by videos seen widely on the internet and television, fueling mistrust and embarrassing agencies that made misleading or incomplete statements that painted their actions in a far more favorable light. Police departments deny lying but acknowledge sometimes making mistakes when releasing information in fast-moving, complicated situations. The videos, they say, do not always capture officers’ perspectives. Defense lawyers say the inaccurate statements are encouraged by a culture of silence in which officers protect misbehaving colleagues, a court system that rarely holds officers accountable and a public that has given police the benefit of the doubt. Floyd died after a white officer put his knee on his neck, even after Floyd stopped moving. Cellphone video showed him pleading for air as other officers stood by and bystanders urged the police to help him. ___ Human remains found at property of man tied to missing kids BOISE, Idaho (AP) — Authorities said they uncovered human remains at an Idaho man’s home Tuesday as they investigated the disappearance of his new wife’s two children — a case that’s drawn global attention for its ties to two other mysterious deaths and the couple’s doomsday beliefs. Chad Daybell, who married the children’s mother, Lori Vallow Daybell, was arrested on suspicion of concealing or destroying evidence after local and federal investigators searched his property, according to the Fremont County Sheriff’s Office. He has not yet been formally charged, and his attorney, Mark Means, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Joshua “JJ” Vallow, who was 7 when he vanished, and 17-year-old Tylee Ryan haven’t been seen since September, and police say Chad and Lori Daybell lied to investigators about the children’s whereabouts before quietly leaving Idaho. They were found in Hawaii months later. Besides the missing children, the couple has been under scrutiny following the deaths of both of their former spouses. Police from the small town of Rexburg, the FBI and sheriff’s investigators searched Chad Daybell’s home in the eastern Idaho town of Salem for the second time, bringing in backhoes and setting up tents in a nearby field. The search warrant is sealed, and Rexburg Assistant Police Chief Gary Hagan said he couldn’t reveal details other than the search is linked to the children’s disappearance. “Throughout the investigation, detectives and investigators have recovered what’s believed to be human remains that have not been identified at this time,” Hagan said in a news conference. ___ New York passes bill to unveil police discipline records ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) — New York state lawmakers repealed a decades-old law Tuesday that has kept law enforcement officers’ disciplinary records secret, spurred by the national uproar over the death of George Floyd. The measure to make officers’ records and misconduct complaints public is among several police accountability bills racing through the state legislature. Others would provide all state troopers with body cameras and ensure that police officers provide medical and mental health attention to people in custody. Many of those bills were first proposed years ago, but got new momentum after huge protests nationwide condemned police brutality. The passage came as criminal charges were brought Tuesday against an NYPD officer over his rough treatment of a protester during demonstrations following the death of Floyd, who pleaded he couldn’t breathe as a white Minneapolis police officer pressed a knee on his neck May 25. Eliminating the law, known as Section 50-a, would make complaints against officers, as well as transcripts and final dispositions of disciplinary proceedings, public for the first time in decades. ___ Senate confirms first black service chief in unanimous vote WASHINGTON (AP) — The Senate on Tuesday unanimously confirmed Gen. Charles Brown Jr. as chief of staff of the U.S. Air Force, making him the first black officer to lead one of the nation’s military services. Vice President Mike Pence took the unusual step of presiding over the vote, something he usually does to break ties. But Brown’s confirmation, 98-0, was not close. Pence called the moment “historic.” The vote came as the Trump administration and the mostly white Senate Republican conference grapple with the aftermath of the killing of George Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis. Protests have convulsed the nation alongside the coronavirus pandemic, with racial discrimination being the common thread between them. The vote in Washington overlapped with Floyd’s funeral in Houston. Brown most recently served as the commander of U.S. Pacific Air Forces. He is a fighter pilot, with more than 2,900 flying hours, including 130 in combat. He posted a video on social media Friday describing a lifetime of dealing with racial bias and the struggle to fit in to a predominantly white society. ___ Confusion reigns as UN scrambles mask, virus spread advice LONDON (AP) — It’s an issue that’s been argued about for months, both by experts and by people strolling through parks all over the world: Can people who don’t feel sick spread the coronavirus, and if so should we all be wearing masks to stop it? Even the World Health Organization can’t seem to get it straight. On Tuesday the U.N. health agency scrambled to explain seemingly contradictory comments it has made in recent days about the two related issues. The confusion and mixed messages only makes controlling the pandemic that much more difficult, experts say. “If you are giving them confusing messages or they’re not convinced about why they should do something, like wear masks, they will just ignore you,” said Ivo Vlaev, a professor of behavioral sciences at the University of Warwick. The communications debacle highlighted WHO’s change to its longstanding mask advice — a revision that was made months after many other organizations and countries already recommended people don masks. ___ Insurance telemarketers fined $225M for a billion robocalls The U.S. communications regulator on Tuesday proposed a $225 million fine, its largest ever, against two health insurance telemarketers for spamming people with 1 billion robocalls using fake phone numbers. The Federal Communications Commission said John Spiller and Jakob Mears made the calls through two businesses. State attorneys general of Arkansas, Indiana, Michigan, Missouri, North Carolina, Ohio and Texas also sued the two men and their companies, Rising Eagle and JSquared Telecom, in federal court in Texas, where both men live, for violating the federal law governing telemarketing, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act. The FCC said the robocalls offered plans from major insurers like Aetna and UnitedHealth with an automated message. If consumers pressed a button for more information, however, they were transferred to a call center that sold plans not connected to those companies. The FCC said the Missouri attorney general sued Rising Eagle’s largest client, Health Advisors of America, for telemarketing violations last year. Over more than four months in early 2019, the FCC said, these telemarketers faked the number their calls displayed in caller ID with intent to deceive consumers; purposefully called people who are on the Do Not Call list; and called people’s mobile phones without getting permission first. Consumers weren’t the only ones bothered. The telemarketers faked their calls to make them appear they came from other companies, which then received angry calls and were named in lawsuits from consumers. The FCC didn’t name these companies, but said one got so many calls that its phone network “became unusable.” ___ What makes an American a patriot? Spike Lee has some answers NEW YORK (AP) — Spike Lee was just 10 when Muhammad Ali, in 1967, refused to be drafted into the Vietnam. It wasn’t his fight, Ali said then. The Vietnamese “never lynched me.” Ali’s stand, and the subsequent vitriol that came his way, made an enormous impression on Lee. His latest film, “Da 5 Bloods,” opens with footage of Ali’s speech. “Everyone is all lovey-dovey with Muhammad Ali now that he’s dead,” says Lee. “But at one time, Muhammad Ali was the most hated man in America.” “Da 5 Bloods,” which premieres Friday on Netflix, is the first major film to put the experience of black Vietnam veterans front and center. Lee bookends the movie with Ali and other black activist figures from the ’60s, framing “Da 5 Bloods” as not just a war film but an inquiry into what patriotism means for African Americans. “The narrative that’s been painted of American heroism is John Wayne,” says Lee. “So I felt it was appropriate that we have true American patriots.”",0.0
1620692312,2020-05-30 00:40:16,ABQ Police Deploy Riot Teams After Peaceful Black Lives Matter Rally,https://www.kunm.org/post/abq-police-deploy-riot-teams-after-peaceful-black-lives-matter-rally,en,False,,146446,kunm.org,http://kunm.org/,"Joining national protests against racist police violence, hundreds of people in Albuquerque participated in a Black Lives Matter car rally Thursday evening, May 28. Near the end of the rally, the Albuquerque Police Department deployed their riot teams, with military-grade equipment, and took into custody four teenagers of color after gunshots were fired nearby. They were not charged and were later released. Their detainment sparked a police altercation with demonstrators. The escalated police response to unarmed Black Lives Matter protesters stands in contrast to the lack of visible police presence at an anti-shutdown demonstration that included armed white protesters on Civic Plaza last month. Black Lives Matter demonstrators, many wearing masks, gathered in cars and on sidewalks in Albuquerque’s International District Thursday evening to grieve the death of George Floyd and others killed in police custody, and to call for justice. Selinda Guerrero, a community organizer with Building Power for Black New Mexico, says they gathered in solidarity with others across the country, but also in response to local police killings of people of color, such as Vicente Villela at the Metropolitan Detention Center in 2019. “Vicente Villela was murdered one year ago in MDC and he was screaming, ‘I can’t breathe’ in the video,” Guerrero said over a bullhorn at the protest. “We are out here for our own people.” Several hundred protesters hung signs from cars, honked and chanted as they looped around the block, with community volunteers in neon vests helping direct traffic. The sign on Katy Wellman’s car read “White silence equals White consent”. “I think it’s very important to show up to all these protests,” said Wellman, “and to show faces, and to show the world that there are supporters, and we do care what’s going on.” APD officers blocked traffic from Central Ave. as many protesters parked their cars and began walking on foot chanting and waving signs. Albuquerque Police Deputy Chief Harold Medina says officers were briefed not to intervene unless there was criminal activity. The department says around 10:00 p.m. they were informed of several shots fired from a vehicle in the area. Once the suspected vehicle got further from the protest site, they pulled it over, and in the car were four young men, two of them black and two Latino. Protesters, including Selinda Guerrero, saw it happening and walked over. “They appeared to be 16 to 18 years old at the most,” said Guerrero. “APD showed up in all unmarked vehicles and they had the kids surrounded. But the officers were dressed in full fatigues, like you would see on a soldier in Afghanistan.” Guerrero says the officers had semi-automatic weapons in the young men’s faces, with an armored vehicle approaching, which APD says was deployed to remove the suspects from the scene. “They were on the ground initially, and then they stood them up when we all came.” The four teenagers were detained but not booked. Deputy Chief Medina says all four people were released, and no weapons were recovered at the scene. APD is investigating whether the four young people were armed. The Albuquerque Police department has a history of using excessive force. Following an investigation, the U.S. Dept. of Justice in 2014 said it was a pattern in the department and it was unconstitutional. They entered into an agreement and yearslong process to enact reforms. In a press conference Friday, Mayor Tim Keller said Thursday night’s incident will be investigated, with the Police Oversight Board and independent investigators from the Department of Justice involved. Deputy Chief Medina says the type of equipment deployed Thursday night -- which included throwing gas canisters -- was not unusual. “Every single large protest, we have our officers prepared in that type of military gear, but we call it riot-control gear,” Medina said. “To go out and respond if necessary and be safe. We also have to think of the safety of our officers.” Last month, several protesters at an anti-shutdown demonstration on Albuquerque’s Civic Plaza were armed with semi-automatic weapons, according to Daily Lobo reporting and photos. Most of those protesters were White, and KRQE reports no Albuquerque police officers were on site. We asked Deputy Chief Medina about this discrepancy in police response at an APD press conference Friday morning. He said they didn’t stage the emergency response teams then because the anti-shutdown protest was expected to be much smaller, whereas 400 people were expected to show for the Black Lives Matter protest. Later Friday morning, at the Mayor’s press briefing, he contradicted himself, saying they were staged at that anti-shutdown action, just not deployed. “We do prepare for all gatherings and all protests the same way,” the Deputy Chief said. “It’s just that our officers last night, our ERT teams, were deployed because we were no longer dealing with a protest.” Medina said the riot teams were deployed Thursday to assist officers after protesters approached and broke the windows of several police vehicles with a bat. Organizer Selinda Guerrero says they chose to hold Thursday’s protest in the International District because its residents, who are predominantly people of color and have low incomes, experience disproportionately high rates of policing. “Somebody who holds the narrative of ‘serve and protect’ – who shows up in military-grade equipment – how are we not to believe we’re in a war zone, when these are our conditions?” she asked. “Why would those children not feel like they’re at war with the police? How could they ever have trust?” The officers in riot-gear left the scene by bus after protesters were pushed back by what the AP reports was tear gas. APD says the protesters dispersed soon after. ****** CORRECTION 6/4, 9 a.m.: Four teenagers were in the vehicle that APD stopped after the protest. Two of them were black, and two Latino. They were all detained and later released, with no charges filed.",0.0

MINNEAPOLIS — Fires burned unchecked and thousands protesting the police killing of George Floyd ignored a curfew as unrest overwhelmed authorities for another night in Minneapolis, and the governor acknowledged Saturday that he didn’t have enough manpower to contain the chaos. The new round of tumult — which has also spread to other cities — came despite Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz vowing Friday to show a more forceful response than city leaders had the day before. But by early Saturday morning, Walz said he didn’t have enough troops, even with some 500 National Guardsmen. “We do not have the numbers,” Walz said. “We cannot arrest people when we are trying to hold ground.” ADVERTISEMENTSkip ................................................................ Walz said he was moving quickly to mobilize more than 1,000 more Guard members, for a total of 1,700, and was considering the potential offer of federal military police. But he warned that even that might not be enough, saying he expected another difficult night Saturday. The Pentagon on Saturday ordered the Army to put military police units on alert to head to the city on short notice at President Donald Trump’s request, according to three people with direct knowledge of the orders who did not want their names used because they were not authorized to discuss the preparations. The rare step came as the violence spread to other cities: A man shot dead in Detroit, police cars battered in Atlanta and skirmishes with police in New York City. Criminal charges filed Friday morning against the white officer who held his knee for nearly nine minutes on the neck of Floyd, a black man who was handcuffed at the time, did nothing to stem the anger. Derek Chauvin, 44, was charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Minneapolis police said shots had been fired at law enforcement officers during the protests but no one was injured. As the night dragged on, fires erupted across the city’s south side, including at a Japanese restaurant, a Wells Fargo bank and an Office Depot. Many burned for hours, with firefighters again delayed in reaching them because areas weren’t secure. Shortly before midnight, scores of officers on foot and in vehicles moved in to curb the violence, one day after city and state leaders faced blowback for their handling of the crisis. On Thursday, protesters had torched a police station soon after it was abandoned by police and went on to burn or vandalize dozens of businesses. The Minnesota Police and Peace Officers Association urged Gov. Walz to accept any help. “You need more resources,” the group said in a tweet. “Law enforcement needs leadership.” ADVERTISEMENTSkip ................................................................ Not all the protests were violent. Downtown, thousands of demonstrators encircled a barricaded police station after the 8 p.m. Friday curfew. “Prosecute the police!” some chanted, and “Say his name: George Floyd!” Some protesters sprayed graffiti on buildings. Anger filled the streets of Minneapolis. Ben Hubert, a 26-year-old local resident, said he wasn’t surprised people were breaking curfew and setting fires. “I’m outraged,” he said of the Floyd case. “But I’m also sad. The injustice has been going on for so long. It’s been swelling for years.” Chauvin was also accused of ignoring another officer who expressed concerns about Floyd as he pleaded that he could not breathe, while Chauvin pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes. Floyd had been arrested on suspicion of using a counterfeit $20 bill at a store. Chauvin, who was fired along with three other officers who were at the scene, faces more than 12 years in prison if convicted of murder. An attorney for Floyd’s family welcomed the arrest but said he expected a more serious murder charge and wants the other officers arrested, too. Prosecutor Mike Freeman said more charges were possible, but authorities “felt it appropriate to focus on the most dangerous perpetrator.” ADVERTISEMENTSkip ................................................................ Protests nationwide have been fueled by outrage over Floyd’s death and years of police violence against African Americans. Protesters smashed windows at CNN headquarters in Atlanta, set a police car on fire and struck officers with bottles. Large demonstrations in New York, Houston, Washington, D.C., and dozens of other cities ranged from people peacefully blocking roads to repeated clashes with police. “You are disgracing our city,” Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms told protesters. “You are disgracing the life of George Floyd and every other person who has been killed in this country.” Police were trying to put Floyd in a squad car Monday when he stiffened and fell to the ground, saying he was claustrophobic, a criminal complaint said. Chauvin and Officer Tou Thoa arrived and tried several times to get the struggling Floyd into the car. Chauvin eventually pulled Floyd out of the car, and the handcuffed Floyd went to the ground face down. Officer J.K. Kueng held Floyd’s back and Officer Thomas Lane held his legs while Chauvin put his knee on Floyd’s head and neck area, the complaint said. When Lane asked if Floyd should be rolled onto his side, Chauvin said, “No, staying put is where we got him.” Lane said he was “worried about excited delirium or whatever.” An autopsy said the combined effects of being restrained, potential intoxicants in Floyd’s system and his underlying health issues, including heart disease, likely contributed to his death. It revealed nothing to support strangulation as the cause of death. There were no other details about intoxicants, and toxicology results can take weeks. In the 911 call that drew police, the caller describes the man suspected of paying with counterfeit money as “awfully drunk and he’s not in control of himself.” After Floyd apparently stopped breathing, Lane again said he wanted to roll Floyd onto his side. Kueng checked for a pulse and said he could not find one, according to the complaint. ADVERTISEMENTSkip ................................................................ Chauvin’s attorney had no comment when reached by The Associated Press. The prosecutor highlighted the “extraordinary speed” in charging the case four days after Floyd’s death and defended himself against questions about why it did not happen sooner. Freeman said his office needed time to gather evidence, including what he called the “horrible” video recorded by a bystander. Trump said Friday that he’d spoken to Floyd’s family and “expressed my sorrow.” He called video of the arrest “just a horrible thing to witness and to watch. It certainly looked like there was no excuse for it.” Attorney Benjamin Crump, who is representing Floyd’s family, asked to take custody of Floyd’s body for an independent autopsy. The doctor who will do the autopsy is Michael Baden, former chief medical examiner of New York City. He was hired to do an autopsy for Eric Garner, a black man who died in 2014 after New York police placed him in a chokehold and he pleaded that he could not breathe. State and federal authorities also are investigating Floyd’s death. ___ Associated Press writers Amy Forliti, Steve Karnowski, and Doug Glass in Minneapolis, Gretchen Ehlke in Milwaukee, Bernard Condon in New York, and James LaPorta in Delray Beach, Fla., contributed to this report.",0.0

MINNEAPOLIS — Tense protests over the death of George Floyd and other police killings of black people grew Saturday from New York to Tulsa to Los Angeles, with police cars set ablaze and reports of injuries mounting on all sides as the country convulsed through another night of unrest after months of coronavirus lockdowns. The protests, which began in Minneapolis following Floyd’s death Monday after a police officer pressed a knee on his neck until he stopped breathing, have left parts of the city a grid of broken windows, burned-out buildings and ransacked stores. The unrest has since become a national phenomenon as protesters decry years of deaths at police hands. Tens of thousands of people were in the streets across the country, many of them not wearing masks or observing social distancing, raising concerns among health experts about the potential for spreading the coronavirus pandemic at a time when much of the country is in the process of reopening society and the economy. ADVERTISEMENTSkip ................................................................ After a tumultuous Friday, racially diverse crowds held mostly peaceful demonstrations in dozens of cities, though many later descended into violence as had happened the previous night. Few corners of America were untouched, from protesters setting fires inside Reno’s city hall, to police launching tear gas at rock-throwing demonstrators in Fargo, North Dakota, to shattered windows at police headquarters in Richmond, Virginia. — In Indianapolis, police were investigating “multiple shootings” downtown, including one that left a person dead, amid the protests. Police gave few details but said no officers were involved. — In Washington, the National Guard was deployed outside the White House, where chanting crowds taunted law enforcement officers. Dressed in camouflage and holding shields, the troops stood in a tight line a few yards from the crowd, preventing them from pushing forward. President Donald Trump, who spent much of Saturday in Florida for the SpaceX rocket launch, landed on the lawn in the presidential helicopter at dusk and went inside without speaking to journalists. — In Philadelphia, at least 13 officers were injured when peaceful protests turned violent and at least four police vehicles were set on fire. Other fires were set throughout downtown. — In Salt Lake City, protesters defied a curfew and National Guard troops were deployed by Utah’s governor. Demonstrators flipped a police car and lit it on fire, and another vehicle was later set ablaze. Police said six people were arrested and a police officer was injured after being struck in the head with a baseball bat. — In Los Angeles, protesters chanted “Black Lives Matter,” some within inches of the face shields of officers. Police used batons to move the crowd back and fired rubber bullets. A graffiti-covered police car burned in the street. — And in New York City, dangerous confrontations flared repeatedly as officers made arrests and cleared streets. A video showed two NYPD cruisers lurching into a crowd of demonstrators who were pushing a barricade against one of them and pelting it with objects. Several people were knocked to the ground, and it was unclear if anyone was hurt. ADVERTISEMENTSkip ................................................................ “The mistakes that are happening are not mistakes. They’re repeated violent terrorist offenses and people need to stop killing black people,” Brooklyn protester Meryl Makielski said. Not all protests devolved into violence. In Juneau, Alaska, law enforcement officers joined elected officials and residents at a peaceful protest in front of a giant whale sculpture on the city’s waterfront. “We don’t tolerate excessive use of force,” Juneau Police Chief Ed Mercer told the gathering. Back in Minneapolis, the city where the protests began, police, state troopers and National Guard members moved in soon after an 8 p.m. curfew took effect to break up protests, firing tear gas and rubber bullets to clear streets outside a police precinct and elsewhere. The show of force came after three days when police largely avoided engaging protesters, and after the state poured in more than 4,000 National Guard troops to Minneapolis and said the number would soon rise to nearly 11,000. “The situation in Minneapolis is no longer in any way about the murder of George Floyd,” said Gov. Tim Walz, who also said local forces had been overmatched the previous day. “It is about attacking civil society, instilling fear and disrupting our great cities.” Minneapolis’ streets steadily grew calmer as the night went on, and Corrections Commissioner Paul Schnell said the tough response would remain as long as it takes to “quell this situation.” Some residents were glad to see the upheaval dissipating. ADVERTISEMENTSkip ................................................................ “l live here. I haven’t been able to sleep,” said Iman Muhammad, whose neighborhood saw multiple fires set Friday night. Muhammad said she sympathized with peaceful protests over Floyd’s death but disagreed with the violence: “Wrong doesn’t answer wrong.” Trump appeared to cheer on the tougher tactics Saturday night, commending the Guard deployment in Minneapolis, declaring “No games!” and saying police in New York City “must be allowed to do their job!” Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden condemned the violence as he continued to express common cause with those demonstrating after Floyd’s death. “The act of protesting should never be allowed to overshadow the reason we protest,” Biden said in a statement Saturday night. Overnight curfews were imposed in more than a dozen major cities nationwide, including Atlanta, Denver, Los Angeles, Minneapolis and Seattle. More than 1,300 people have been arrested in 16 cities since Thursday, including over 500 Friday in Los Angeles. The unrest comes at a time when most Americans have spent months inside over concerns surrounding the coronavirus, which the president has called an “invisible enemy.” The events of the last 72 hours, seen live on national television, have shown the opposite: a sudden pivot to crowds, screaming protesters and burning buildings, and a stark contrast to the empty streets of recent months. “Quite frankly I’m ready to just lock people up,” Atlanta Police Chief Erika Shields said at a news conference. Demonstrations there turned violent Friday, and police were arresting protesters Saturday on blocked-off downtown streets. “Yes, you caught us off balance once. It’s not going to happen twice.” ADVERTISEMENTSkip ................................................................ This week’s unrest recalled the riots in Los Angeles nearly 30 years ago after the acquittal of the white police officers who beat Rodney King, a black motorist who had led them on a high-speed chase. The protests of Floyd’s killing have gripped many more cities, but the losses in Minneapolis have yet to approach the staggering totals Los Angeles saw during five days of rioting in 1992, when more than 60 people died, 2,000-plus were injured and thousands arrested, with property damage topping $1 billion. Many protesters spoke of frustration that Floyd’s death was one more in a litany. It came in the wake of the killing in Georgia of Ahmaud Arbery, a black man who was shot dead after being pursued by two white men while running in their neighborhood, and in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic that has thrown millions out of work, killed more than 100,000 people in the U.S. and disproportionately affected black people. The officer who held his knee to Floyd’s neck as he begged for air was arrested Friday and charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. But many protesters are demanding the arrests of the three other officers involved. Trump stoked the anger on Twitter, saying that if protesters had breached the White House fence, they would “have been greeted with the most vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons, I have ever seen.” Leaders in many affected cities have voiced outrage over Floyd’s killing and expressed sympathy for protesters’ concerns. But as the unrest intensified, they spoke of a desperate need to protect their cities and said they would call in reinforcements, despite concerns that could lead to more heavy-handed tactics. Governors in Georgia, Kentucky, Ohio and Texas also activated the National Guard after protests there turned violent. Police in St. Louis were investigating the death of a protester who climbed between two trailers of a Fed Ex truck and was killed when it drove away. And a person was killed in the area of protests in downtown Detroit just before midnight after someone fired shots into an SUV, officers said. Police had initially said someone fired into the crowd from an SUV. ___ Numerous AP journalists contributed from across the U.S.",0.0

SANTA FE – About 250 people amassed at the state Capitol late Friday afternoon for a peaceful protest, joining hundreds of thousands of people across the country demonstrating against the killing of George Floyd, a black man who died at the hands of white police officers in Minneapolis on Monday. The demonstration, organized through social media, came a day after protesters in Minneapolis set fire to a police station and other buildings, resulting in the National Guard being deployed. That same night in Albuquerque, police in riot gear used tear gas in a confrontation with protesters and several arrests were made. A New Mexico State Police helicopter circled overhead at the Santa Fe demonstration. ADVERTISEMENTSkip ................................................................ Santa Fe police showed up briefly after protesters took to the streets and marched to the downtown plaza and back, but left soon thereafter. After most of the crowd dispersed, about 50 protesters lingered and continued the demonstration at the intersection of Paseo de Peralta and Old Santa Fe Trail, shouting at passing vehicles, some of which answered back by honking their horns. “I think everyone has had enough. There needs to be change,” said 17-year-old Abby Bay, one of the people who spread the word about the protest on Facebook. “What happened in Minneapolis, it could happen anywhere, even here.” Lacking an organizer, several people stepped up to lead the crowd in chants of “black lives matter” and “I can’t breathe,” the latter words spoken by Floyd as a Minneapolis police officer pressed him to the ground with a knee to his neck. “We’re standing up for the injustices against black people,” said Lonnica Montoya, who led most of the chants. At one point, Montoya read the names of several dozen black citizens who have died at the hands of police. Another woman, Amy Linquist, led the protesters in a song called “Somebody’s Hurting My Brother,” which she said grew out of the Poor People’s Campaign. Protesters also carried signs, some reading “There’s power in Unity” and “Complacency = Complicity.” Holding a sign that said “I can’t breathe,” Derrick Gomez was one of fewer than a dozen African Americans at the demonstration. ADVERTISEMENTSkip ................................................................ “What’s going on in Minneapolis with the riots and looting, and in Albuquerque with police and their guns, we’re here with just signs,” he said. “We have to stand up for what we believe in.” Gomez, who grew up in Santa Fe, where fewer than 1% of people identify as black or African American, said he’s experienced racism all his life. “It’s great to see the diversity here, especially here in New Mexico, where our culture is rich,” he said. “It’s moving that people here do care.” Gomez said he hoped the protests being held across the country will make a difference and change attitudes about racism in America. “As long as we continue, they have to listen to us at some point,” he said. “The moment we quit is the moment they win.”",0.0

(KRQE) – Albuquerque joins the nationwide outcry over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. During a press conference on Friday, the Albuquerque Police Department provided an update of the protests that took place Thursday night and what transpired. People were seen lining the streets near Central and Wyoming on Thursday night chanting, holding signs, many saying they’re just desperate for racial equality and they want to make sure their voices are heard. Protesters say they are frustrated after another African American was killed at the hands of a white police officer. After Floyd’s death earlier this week, they say they can’t wrap their head around how this keeps happening and they are tired of seeing these senseless deaths. Protesters also say they worry it could happen here. “People say black lives matter, people say blue lives matter. Yes you’re right, blue lives do matter, white lives matter, Asian lives matter, Native lives matter but in this point in time right now, black people’s lives are getting treated worse than animals and it’s time for it to stop,” said protester Damien Johnson. The Albuquerque Police Department was in the area of Central and Mesilla monitoring the protest. They report several shots were fired from a vehicle in the area of Wisconsin and Central and that four people were taken into custody. The Albuquerque Police Department held a press conference on Friday, to highlight what took place during the demonstrations. APD Police Chief Mike Geier stated that the protest started off peaceful with around 400 people gathering. Police report they were able to shut down Central from Wyoming to Louisiana so that residents could gather and have their voices heard. Deputy Chief Harold Medina thanked the initial group of individuals who participated in the peaceful demonstration. “I want to start by first thanking the first group of individuals that went out. This group of individuals went out and they peacefully demonstrated and they were a good example of what it means to be an American and exercise your first amendment right,” said Medina. A second group of individuals were in the area of Wyoming and Central around 9:30 p.m. and were causing a disturbance. Geier stated that a female sergeant was approached by individuals and her vehicle was damaged. “One of our female officers, a Sergeant, was driving in the area. A group surrounded her car, attacked the car. Actually broke the windows and caused some damage to the car,” said Geier. Several individuals were also seen on camera approaching vehicles and were attempting to drag civilians out of their cars and tried to damage their vehicles. Medina stated that one vehicle in particular was driving around firing shots. While it is unclear how many shots were fired by that specific vehicle, Medina says that the department used its new shot spotter technology to determine that there were about 33 total registered reports of shots fired in the area. Police say that the suspect vehicle drove to the area of Mesilla and Central where police attempted to initiate a traffic stop to take individuals into custody. One suspect fled the scene on foot but eventually returned and four people in total were taken into custody. While officers were trying to process the scene, a group of people started to cause problems for the officers. One individual allegedly took a baseball bat to several police vehicles, breaking the windows. “A group of individuals from the Wyoming area responded to where the officers were conducting the traffic stop, surrounded our officers, and began to commit criminal damage to some of our police vehicles,” said Medina. At that time, two Emergency Response Teams were called to the area to secure the scene and an armored vehicle was sent in to extract the individuals who were taken into custody. Medina states to prevent further escalation, police decided to leave the suspect vehicle at the scene. At this time, Medina explains the ERT teams were being confronted by the crowd and as the teams were told to fall back, the crowd would advance. The department used a helicopter spotlight to distract the crowd and buses were able to pick up officers. Medina states the crowd did attempt to follow the officers who were trying to exit the scene and gas was used to create distance between the officers and the crowd so that the officers were able to board the bus and leave the scene. The crowd dispersed shortly after. The four individuals who were arrested have since been released pending further investigation. Chief Geier made the following statement on behalf of the Albuquerque Police Department: The death of Mr. Floyd is deeply disturbing and should be of concern to everybody in our country. On behalf of our department and the city of Albuquerque, I would like to offer our sympathies and condolences to the Floyd family. Those officers’ actions are inconsistent with the training and protocols of our department. APD has worked tirelessly to build trust between law enforcement and the community we are sworn to protect. What occurred in Minneapolis is an unfortunate reminder of how quickly a death can undermine interest. The law enforcement profession must do better and hold ourselves to a higher standard. Our officers are trained to treat all individuals with dignity and respect. This is the essence of the principles of procedural justice. Like APD, most agencies today are taught to teach their officers to de-escalate critical situations and avoid the use of force if possible. We will not tolerate these actions and denounce this type of police brutality. The senseless misconduct demonstrated in this unfortunate incident should not define other police departments across the nation. APD denounces the behavior of the Minneapolis officers and we will continue to build the trust we’ve established in the community we proudly serve. “ APD Police Chief Mike Geier Related Coverage:",0.0

Floyd’s death and footage of the officer pressing a knee into his neck for several minutes have unleashed protests and violent clashes with law enforcement — exposing simmering frustration and the fact that there’s much work still ahead, several advocates and leaders told The Associated Press. “Progress and change can ebb and flow,” said Jeremiah Ellison, who won a City Council seat after participating in past protests against police killings of African Americans in Minnesota. The four nights of unrest this week — including the torching of a police station that officers abandoned — “proved to me that we’ve regressed to the point of 2015,” Ellison said, referring to the year that also saw protests after the death of Jamar Clark, a black man killed by police. Minneapolis — a city of nearly 430,000 that is 60% white, 19% black and 9% Hispanic — has a long history of economic and educational disparities that have marginalized black residents for decades, despite its reputation for progressive values. It is one of the most segregated cities in the country for its size, and schools suffer from stubborn achievement gaps. The city appointed its first black chief of police nearly three years ago, after slow progress toward making the department more inclusive. Earlier this year, a statewide task force made up of activists, people representing victims of police brutality, and law enforcement leaders released recommendations for policing reforms. That task force was formed in the wake of several high-profile fatal shootings of black men by police in the Minneapolis area. Those included Clark, who was killed during a struggle with two white Minneapolis officers, and Philando Castile, who was fatally shot by a Hispanic suburban police officer during a traffic stop in 2016. While Nekima Levy Armstrong, a civil rights lawyer and former president of the Minneapolis NAACP, acknowledges that progress, she said that many old habits are still entrenched. “The system itself has not changed,” Armstrong said. “The culture within the Minneapolis Police Department has not changed.” The city’s police department of more than 800 officers is still predominantly white, she said. The department did not respond to a request for up-to-date figures, but the Star Tribune reported in 2014 that the force, including cadets in field training, was 78.9% white, 9.2% black, 5.2% Asian, 4.1% Hispanic and 2.5% American Indian. Some leaders, including former Mayor R.T. Rybak and state Sen. Jeff Hayden, have blamed the city’s police union in recent days for fostering a culture that protects brutal officers and resists efforts at reform. The union’s president, Lt. Bob Kroll, did not return a call seeking comment. The eruption of anger in Minneapolis reflects frustration over these realities, despite some progress, said Teqen Zéa-Aida, a longtime activist in the city. But the images themselves also demanded a “public response,” he said, though he pushed for protests to happen online given the risks of gatherings during the coronavirus pandemic. “We saw his eyes … we saw a lynching. George Floyd is Emmett Till, 2020,” he said, referring to the black 14-year-old who was abducted, beaten and killed in 1955 after he was accused of whistling at a white woman in Mississippi, a lynching that helped spur the civil rights movement. Bystander video and photos of the arrest showed Floyd on the ground, while Officer Derek Chauvin kneels on his neck, ignoring his pleas for help. Two other officers appear to help hold him down, and a fourth attempts to keep space around the scene. “My stomach hurts, my neck hurts, everything hurts … I can’t breathe,” said Floyd, who eventually becomes motionless. Police initially said they arrested Floyd because he matched the description of a man suspected of passing a counterfeit $20 bill at a grocery store and that he resisted arrest. Police were trying to put Floyd in a squad car when he stiffened up and fell to the ground, saying he was claustrophobic, according to the criminal complaint detailing charges against Chauvin. In addition to igniting the turmoil in Minneapolis, Floyd’s death has garnered national attention, and it drew comparisons to the case of Eric Garner, a black man who died in 2014 in New York after he was placed in a chokehold by police and also said he could not breathe. The delay in Chauvin’s arrest may have also helped to drive the protests, which turned markedly more violent than those that followed the deaths of either Clark or Castile. Authorities arrested Chauvin and charged him Friday with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. His attorney had no comment when reached by the AP. The other three officers involved have not been charged, but the investigation is continuing. All four were fired Tuesday shortly after the video began circulating. Some activists and community leaders said they expected the protests to continue to push for the arrests of and charges for the three other officers. Floyd’s death “just touched people in a way that they didn’t expect,” said Armstrong. “We must get to the underlying solutions or we will be right back here in a fairly short time,” said Keith Ellison, the state’s first African American attorney general, whose son is the Minneapolis city councilman. “We’ve got to literally shift policing.” Ramsey County Undersheriff Bill Finney, who in 1992 became the first African American police chief in Minnesota when he was appointed to the job in neighboring St. Paul, said even when the relationship between police and the black community improves, all sides must guard against complacency. “You have to constantly make deposits into the community bank of goodwill,” Finney said. “You want to get to a place where the community stops considering you as ‘the police’ and starts seeing you as their police.”",0.0

The new round of tumult — which has also spread to other cities — came despite Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz vowing Friday to show a more forceful response than city leaders had the day before. But by early Saturday morning, Walz said he didn’t have enough troops, even with some 500 National Guardsmen. “We do not have the numbers,” Walz said. “We cannot arrest people when we are trying to hold ground.” Walz said he was moving quickly to mobilize more than 1,000 more Guard members, for a total of 1,700, and was considering the potential offer of federal military police. But he warned that even that might not be enough, saying he expected another difficult night Saturday. The Pentagon on Saturday ordered the Army to put military police units on alert to head to the city on short notice at President Donald Trump’s request, according to three people with direct knowledge of the orders who did not want their names used because they were not authorized to discuss the preparations. The rare step came as the violence spread to other cities: A man shot dead in Detroit, police cars battered in Atlanta and skirmishes with police in New York City. Criminal charges filed Friday morning against the white officer who held his knee for nearly nine minutes on the neck of Floyd, a black man who was handcuffed at the time, did nothing to stem the anger. Derek Chauvin, 44, was charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Minneapolis police said shots had been fired at law enforcement officers during the protests but no one was injured. As the night dragged on, fires erupted across the city’s south side, including at a Japanese restaurant, a Wells Fargo bank and an Office Depot. Many burned for hours, with firefighters again delayed in reaching them because areas weren’t secure. Shortly before midnight, scores of officers on foot and in vehicles moved in to curb the violence, one day after city and state leaders faced blowback for their handling of the crisis. On Thursday, protesters had torched a police station soon after it was abandoned by police and went on to burn or vandalize dozens of businesses. The Minnesota Police and Peace Officers Association urged Gov. Walz to accept any help. “You need more resources,” the group said in a tweet. “Law enforcement needs leadership.” Not all the protests were violent. Downtown, thousands of demonstrators encircled a barricaded police station after the 8 p.m. Friday curfew. “Prosecute the police!” some chanted, and “Say his name: George Floyd!” Some protesters sprayed graffiti on buildings. Anger filled the streets of Minneapolis. Ben Hubert, a 26-year-old local resident, said he wasn’t surprised people were breaking curfew and setting fires. “I’m outraged,” he said of the Floyd case. “But I’m also sad. The injustice has been going on for so long. It’s been swelling for years.” Chauvin was also accused of ignoring another officer who expressed concerns about Floyd as he pleaded that he could not breathe, while Chauvin pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes. Floyd had been arrested on suspicion of using a counterfeit $20 bill at a store. Chauvin, who was fired along with three other officers who were at the scene, faces more than 12 years in prison if convicted of murder. An attorney for Floyd’s family welcomed the arrest but said he expected a more serious murder charge and wants the other officers arrested, too. Prosecutor Mike Freeman said more charges were possible, but authorities “felt it appropriate to focus on the most dangerous perpetrator.” Protests nationwide have been fueled by outrage over Floyd’s death and years of police violence against African Americans. Protesters smashed windows at CNN headquarters in Atlanta, set a police car on fire and struck officers with bottles. Large demonstrations in New York, Houston, Washington, D.C., and dozens of other cities ranged from people peacefully blocking roads to repeated clashes with police. “You are disgracing our city,” Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms told protesters. “You are disgracing the life of George Floyd and every other person who has been killed in this country.” Police were trying to put Floyd in a squad car Monday when he stiffened and fell to the ground, saying he was claustrophobic, a criminal complaint said. Chauvin and Officer Tou Thoa arrived and tried several times to get the struggling Floyd into the car. Chauvin eventually pulled Floyd out of the car, and the handcuffed Floyd went to the ground face down. Officer J.K. Kueng held Floyd’s back and Officer Thomas Lane held his legs while Chauvin put his knee on Floyd’s head and neck area, the complaint said. When Lane asked if Floyd should be rolled onto his side, Chauvin said, “No, staying put is where we got him.” Lane said he was “worried about excited delirium or whatever.” An autopsy said the combined effects of being restrained, potential intoxicants in Floyd’s system and his underlying health issues, including heart disease, likely contributed to his death. It revealed nothing to support strangulation as the cause of death. RELATED: Police appear to shoot TV reporter, photographer with pepper balls There were no other details about intoxicants, and toxicology results can take weeks. In the 911 call that drew police, the caller describes the man suspected of paying with counterfeit money as “awfully drunk and he’s not in control of himself.” After Floyd apparently stopped breathing, Lane again said he wanted to roll Floyd onto his side. Kueng checked for a pulse and said he could not find one, according to the complaint. Chauvin’s attorney had no comment when reached by The Associated Press.

1620956885,2020-05-30 10:19:08,Protests over George Floyd death overwhelm authorities again,https://www.krqe.com/news/national/protests-over-george-floyd-death-overwhelm-authorities-again/,en,True,,96605,krqe.com,http://www.krqe.com/#spider,"MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Fires burned unchecked and thousands protesting the police killing of George Floyd ignored a curfew as unrest overwhelmed authorities for another night in Minneapolis, and the governor acknowledged Saturday that he didn’t have enough manpower to contain the chaos. The new round of tumult — which has also spread to other cities — came despite Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz vowing Friday to show a more forceful response than city leaders had the day before. But by early Saturday morning, Walz said he didn’t have enough troops, even with some 500 National Guardsmen. “We do not have the numbers,” Walz said. “We cannot arrest people when we are trying to hold ground.” Walz said he was moving quickly to mobilize more than 1,000 more Guard members, for a total of 1,700, and was considering the potential offer of federal military police. But he warned that even that might not be enough, saying he expected another difficult night Saturday. The Pentagon on Saturday ordered the Army to put military police units on alert to head to the city on short notice at President Donald Trump’s request, according to three people with direct knowledge of the orders who did not want their names used because they were not authorized to discuss the preparations. The rare step came as the violence spread to other cities: A man shot dead in Detroit, police cars battered in Atlanta and skirmishes with police in New York City. Criminal charges filed Friday morning against the white officer who held his knee for nearly nine minutes on the neck of Floyd, a black man who was handcuffed at the time, did nothing to stem the anger. Derek Chauvin, 44, was charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Minneapolis police said shots had been fired at law enforcement officers during the protests but no one was injured. As the night dragged on, fires erupted across the city’s south side, including at a Japanese restaurant, a Wells Fargo bank and an Office Depot. Many burned for hours, with firefighters again delayed in reaching them because areas weren’t secure. Shortly before midnight, scores of officers on foot and in vehicles moved in to curb the violence, one day after city and state leaders faced blowback for their handling of the crisis. On Thursday, protesters had torched a police station soon after it was abandoned by police and went on to burn or vandalize dozens of businesses. The Minnesota Police and Peace Officers Association urged Gov. Walz to accept any help. “You need more resources,” the group said in a tweet. “Law enforcement needs leadership.” Not all the protests were violent. Downtown, thousands of demonstrators encircled a barricaded police station after the 8 p.m. Friday curfew. “Prosecute the police!” some chanted, and “Say his name: George Floyd!” Some protesters sprayed graffiti on buildings. Anger filled the streets of Minneapolis. Ben Hubert, a 26-year-old local resident, said he wasn’t surprised people were breaking curfew and setting fires. “I’m outraged,” he said of the Floyd case. “But I’m also sad. The injustice has been going on for so long. It’s been swelling for years.” Chauvin was also accused of ignoring another officer who expressed concerns about Floyd as he pleaded that he could not breathe, while Chauvin pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes. Floyd had been arrested on suspicion of using a counterfeit $20 bill at a store. Chauvin, who was fired along with three other officers who were at the scene, faces more than 12 years in prison if convicted of murder. An attorney for Floyd’s family welcomed the arrest but said he expected a more serious murder charge and wants the other officers arrested, too. Prosecutor Mike Freeman said more charges were possible, but authorities “felt it appropriate to focus on the most dangerous perpetrator.” Protests nationwide have been fueled by outrage over Floyd’s death and years of police violence against African Americans. Protesters smashed windows at CNN headquarters in Atlanta, set a police car on fire and struck officers with bottles. Large demonstrations in New York, Houston, Washington, D.C., and dozens of other cities ranged from people peacefully blocking roads to repeated clashes with police. “You are disgracing our city,” Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms told protesters. “You are disgracing the life of George Floyd and every other person who has been killed in this country.” Police were trying to put Floyd in a squad car Monday when he stiffened and fell to the ground, saying he was claustrophobic, a criminal complaint said. Chauvin and Officer Tou Thoa arrived and tried several times to get the struggling Floyd into the car. Chauvin eventually pulled Floyd out of the car, and the handcuffed Floyd went to the ground face down. Officer J.K. Kueng held Floyd’s back and Officer Thomas Lane held his legs while Chauvin put his knee on Floyd’s head and neck area, the complaint said. When Lane asked if Floyd should be rolled onto his side, Chauvin said, “No, staying put is where we got him.” Lane said he was “worried about excited delirium or whatever.” An autopsy said the combined effects of being restrained, potential intoxicants in Floyd’s system and his underlying health issues, including heart disease, likely contributed to his death. It revealed nothing to support strangulation as the cause of death. RELATED: Police appear to shoot TV reporter, photographer with pepper balls There were no other details about intoxicants, and toxicology results can take weeks. In the 911 call that drew police, the caller describes the man suspected of paying with counterfeit money as “awfully drunk and he’s not in control of himself.” After Floyd apparently stopped breathing, Lane again said he wanted to roll Floyd onto his side. Kueng checked for a pulse and said he could not find one, according to the complaint. Chauvin’s attorney had no comment when reached by The Associated Press. The prosecutor highlighted the “extraordinary speed” in charging the case four days after Floyd’s death and defended himself against questions about why it did not happen sooner. Freeman said his office needed time to gather evidence, including what he called the “horrible” video recorded by a bystander. Trump said Friday that he’d spoken to Floyd’s family and “expressed my sorrow.” He called video of the arrest “just a horrible thing to witness and to watch.

Council President Hardin tweeted a video with Rep. Beatty saying that they are okay, and called on people on both sides of the protest to remain calm. Beatty said in an interview later Saturday that the pepper spray was “prolific.” “I don’t remember hearing anyone saying, ‘Move or we’re going to pepper spray,’” Beatty said. “Councilman Hardin got the brunt of it and he was in the middle of the sidewalk.” She added that she didn’t think the pepper spray was necessary. “I heard no warning,” she said. “Obviously if someone had said and held up a pepper spray and said, ‘I’m gonna pepper spray,’ we would have moved. Nobody wants to be pepper sprayed, trust me.” A spokesperson for Beatty told NBC4 that while the protest was underway, someone started scuffling with police. Police took that person down, which made other protesters angry. Beatty stepped in to try and calm the situation when police started spraying. Hardin and Boyce pulled Beatty out of the fray. “We understand that tensions are high. Our tensions are high as well. We are angry, and we need change. But the only way we will get change is by peaceful demonstrations,” said Hardin. “While it was peaceful, there were times where people got off the curb, into the street, said Beatty. “Too much force is not the answer this.” Beatty said Saturday’s protest was more peaceful than the protests on Friday night, when stores and businesses were damaged, saying she wanted to be there to support the organizers of Saturday’s protest. “I can tell you 95 percent of the folks were amazing,” Beatty said. She said that in the last 20 minutes she was in the area are when things began to take a turn with the arrival of police on bicycles. “Whatever happened last night, which I am totally against – breaking into buildings, marking up city hall – I am totally against that,” Beatty said. “But there was none of that today and I kept saying to the officers, ‘Do not excite them, do not excite them.’” Beatty added that a handful of protesters got off the sidewalks and into the streets, which is what prompted the police response. “Before we knew it, the bikes were going up against a young sister standing next to me,” she said. “A gentleman was knocked to the ground and then you know what happened. People start pushing and shoving. I got caught in the middle of it. Beatty said Hardin was pepper sprayed more than she was, adding Boyce was there and managed to get Beatty out of the way. Just want to let folks know that when @RepBeatty @VoteBoyce and I were down at the protest we did get sprayed with mace or pepper spray.

So I was there on the edge of the sidewalk when it all happened, wanting to support and feeling the need to protect this young sister. She was very vocal, but that’s freedom of speech.

Today, I saw with my own eyes that 99 percent of protesters were just trying to make their voices heard, while some individuals in the crowd were attempting to take advantage of the situation. I also saw police going too far, and that’s unacceptable. The people have spoken, and I hear you. The time for commissions and studies is over. The time to institute real police reform is now.  “Columbus needs to establish independent investigations into police use of force, including negotiating a Civilian Review Commission into the next police contract. Columbus needs to change the use of crowd dispersal techniques, as recommended by the Matrix report. And finally, Columbus needs to quickly move forward to implement the Community Safety Advisory Commission’s recommendations and the rest of the Matrix report.” The Matrix report is a review of Columbus law enforcement conducted by a team of consultants, employees of the Division of Police, city staff and the community working together since the winter of 2018-19. Beatty urged the protesters to recognize the difference between standing up to injustices and causing injustice. “If you’re going to be out there causing injustice and destroying property and looting and doing any of those things, that it is more destructive and that’s not the way we gain what we’re all in this for and that’s to bring justice,” she said. “I’ll be the first to stand with them, but we cannot tear up our own communities and our own buildings because that’s not going to accomplish anything.”",0.0

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci) WASHINGTON (AP) — Police fired pepper spray at demonstrators near the White House and the D.C. National Guard was called in as pockets of violence and vandalism erupted during a second straight night of protests over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis and President Donald Trump’s response to it. Hundreds of people converged on the White House and marched along the National Mall, chanting “Black Lives Matter,” “I can’t breathe” and “No justice, no peace.” Protesters threw water bottles, traffic cones, scooters, even tear gas cans at police lines. They set fire to a car and a trash bin and smashed windows, including at Bay Atlantic University. “What are you doing? That’s a school,” one man yelled. An American flag hanging at the Export-Import Bank was taken down, burned and replaced with a Black Lives Matter banner. The D.C. demonstration was one of several around the country responding to the death of Floyd, a black man who died in police custody. Trump appeared to cheer on the tougher tactics being used by law enforcement to disperse protesters Saturday night. He commended National Guard troops deployed in Minneapolis, declaring “No games!” and he also said police in New York City “must be allowed to do their job!” “Let New York’s Finest be New York’s Finest,” Trump said on Twitter after returning to the White House from Florida, where he watched the launch of a SpaceX rocket. He did not talk to reporters upon his return and it was not clear if he could hear the protest over the sound of his helicopter. But for at least part of the flight, televisions on Air Force One were turned to Fox News and its coverage of the protests. Earlier in the day, he had belittled the protesters and pledged to “stop mob violence.” “I stand before you as a friend and ally to every American seeking justice and peace, and I stand before you in firm opposition to anyone exploiting this tragedy to loot, rob, attack and menace,” the president said after watching the launch of a SpaceX rocket. “Healing, not hatred, justice, not chaos, are the missions at hand.” Police were in tactical gear. The D.C. National Guard was activated at the direction of the secretary of the Army and at the request of the Park Police to help maintain order near the White House, Commanding Gen. William J. Walker said in a post on the Guard’s Facebook page. “We’re sick of it. The cops are out of control,” protester Olga Hall said. “They’re wild. There’s just been too many dead boys,” she said. Some vocal protesters directed their comments at a black police officer. “Do you support this violence?” they asked him. “How are you going to protect your kids?” The officer got emotional to the point he had to be relieved. An activist wearing a Black Lives Matter T-shirt put himself between police and the protesters and yelled, “Stop. This is what they want.” Speaking over a megaphone earlier in the evening, Cameron McCall said, “We don’t need violence. All we need are our voices.” While some protesters stayed near the White House, others marched through the streets chanting, “No justice and no peace.” and “Say his name: George Floyd.” The mood was angry and several speakers implored marchers to remain peaceful. The march paused between the the Washington Monument and the National Museum of African American History and Culture. Demonstrators sat down in the street for a moment of silence lasting for the eight minutes or more that the Minneapolis police officer reportedly knelt on Floyd’s neck. At the Lincoln Memorial, one organizer spoke over a megaphone. “Look to the left and to the right and thank that person. We can’t hug anybody because of COVID, but I love you anyway.” Many of the protesters wore masks, but did not socially distance themselves. Another group circled through the Capitol Hill neighborhood for at least an hour in cars, honking. A helicopter hovered overhead. In a series of tweets earlier Saturday, Trump doubted protesters’ allegiance to Floyd’s memory, saying they were “professionally managed.” He offered no evidence to back his assertion, and the president even seemed to invite supporters to make their presence felt: “Tonight, I understand, is MAGA NIGHT AT THE WHITE HOUSE???” Trump later rejected the suggestion that he was stoking a potential conflict between protesters and his supporters. “I was just asking. But I have no idea if they are going to be here,” he said. “MAGA is Make America Great Again. By the way, they love African American people. They love black people.” At Saturday’s demonstration, there was no evidence of a counter-move by Trump supporters. Trump said he had “watched every move” from inside the executive mansion during Friday’s protest and “couldn’t have felt more safe” as the Secret Service let the protesters carry on, “but whenever someone … got too frisky or out of line, they would quickly come down on then, hard — didn’t know what hit them.” The president also criticized the mayors of Washington and Minneapolis. Trump said Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey “is probably a very good person, but he’s a radical, left mayor.” He then described how he watched as a police station in the city was overrun. “For that police station to be abandoned and taken over, I’ve never seen anything so horrible and stupid in my life,” Trump said when speaking briefly to reporters at the White House. He said Minnesota officials have to get tougher with rioters, and that by doing so they would be honoring the memory of Floyd. The Secret Service said in a statement Saturday that six protesters were arrested in Washington and “multiple” officers were injured. There were no details on the charges or nature of the injuries. A spokesman for U.S. Park Police said their officers made no arrests, but several suffered minor injuries and one was taken to a hospital after being struck in the helmet by a projectile. Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf on Saturday called the protesters “criminals” who committed “acts of violence while hiding behind their First Amendment right of lawful protest.” Late Saturday and early Sunday, protesters vented their rage by breaking into tony shops of Georgetown, on the western edge of the District, and in downtown Washington, breaking windows and glass doors of many stores and looting some of them. In his tweeting, Trump claimed that many Secret Service agents were “just waiting for action” and ready to unleash “the most vicious dogs, and the most ominous weapons, I have ever seen.” His reference to “vicious dogs” potentially being sicced on protesters revisits images from the civil rights movement when marchers faced snarling police dogs and high-pressure fire hoses. In a news conference Saturday afternoon, Muriel Bowser, mayor of the nation’s capital, called Trump’s remarks “gross” and said the reference to attack dogs conjures up with the worst memories of the nation’s fight against segregation. “I call upon our city and our nation to exercise restraint, great restraint, even as the president tries to divide us,” she said. “I feel like these comments are an attack on humanity, an attack on black America, and they make my city less safe.” In contrast with the president’s tweets, the Secret Service said it “respects the right to assemble and we ask that individuals do so peacefully for the safety of all.” ___ AP video journalist Nathan Ellgren contributed to this report.",0.0

And finally, Columbus needs to quickly move forward to implement the Community Safety Advisory Commission’s recommendations and the rest of the Matrix report.” The Matrix report is a review of Columbus law enforcement conducted by a team of consultants, employees of the Division of Police, city staff and the community working together since the winter of 2018-19. Beatty urged the protesters to recognize the difference between standing up to injustices and causing injustice. “If you’re going to be out there causing injustice and destroying property and looting and doing any of those things, that it is more destructive and that’s not the way we gain what we’re all in this for and that’s to bring justice,” she said. “I’ll be the first to stand with them, but we cannot tear up our own communities and our own buildings because that’s not going to accomplish anything.”",0.0

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci) WASHINGTON (AP) — Police fired pepper spray at demonstrators near the White House and the D.C. National Guard was called in as pockets of violence and vandalism erupted during a second straight night of protests over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis and President Donald Trump’s response to it. Hundreds of people converged on the White House and marched along the National Mall, chanting “Black Lives Matter,” “I can’t breathe” and “No justice, no peace.” Protesters threw water bottles, traffic cones, scooters, even tear gas cans at police lines. They set fire to a car and a trash bin and smashed windows, including at Bay Atlantic University. “What are you doing? That’s a school,” one man yelled. An American flag hanging at the Export-Import Bank was taken down, burned and replaced with a Black Lives Matter banner. The D.C. demonstration was one of several around the country responding to the death of Floyd, a black man who died in police custody. Trump appeared to cheer on the tougher tactics being used by law enforcement to disperse protesters Saturday night. He commended National Guard troops deployed in Minneapolis, declaring “No games!” and he also said police in New York City “must be allowed to do their job!” “Let New York’s Finest be New York’s Finest,” Trump said on Twitter after returning to the White House from Florida, where he watched the launch of a SpaceX rocket. He did not talk to reporters upon his return and it was not clear if he could hear the protest over the sound of his helicopter. But for at least part of the flight, televisions on Air Force One were turned to Fox News and its coverage of the protests. Earlier in the day, he had belittled the protesters and pledged to “stop mob violence.” “I stand before you as a friend and ally to every American seeking justice and peace, and I stand before you in firm opposition to anyone exploiting this tragedy to loot, rob, attack and menace,” the president said after watching the launch of a SpaceX rocket. “Healing, not hatred, justice, not chaos, are the missions at hand.” Police were in tactical gear. The D.C. National Guard was activated at the direction of the secretary of the Army and at the request of the Park Police to help maintain order near the White House, Commanding Gen. William J. Walker said in a post on the Guard’s Facebook page. “We’re sick of it. The cops are out of control,” protester Olga Hall said. “They’re wild. There’s just been too many dead boys,” she said. Some vocal protesters directed their comments at a black police officer. “Do you support this violence?” they asked him. “How are you going to protect your kids?” The officer got emotional to the point he had to be relieved. An activist wearing a Black Lives Matter T-shirt put himself between police and the protesters and yelled, “Stop. This is what they want.” Speaking over a megaphone earlier in the evening, Cameron McCall said, “We don’t need violence. All we need are our voices.” While some protesters stayed near the White House, others marched through the streets chanting, “No justice and no peace.” and “Say his name: George Floyd.” The mood was angry and several speakers implored marchers to remain peaceful. The march paused between the the Washington Monument and the National Museum of African American History and Culture. Demonstrators sat down in the street for a moment of silence lasting for the eight minutes or more that the Minneapolis police officer reportedly knelt on Floyd’s neck. At the Lincoln Memorial, one organizer spoke over a megaphone. “Look to the left and to the right and thank that person. We can’t hug anybody because of COVID, but I love you anyway.” Many of the protesters wore masks, but did not socially distance themselves. Another group circled through the Capitol Hill neighborhood for at least an hour in cars, honking. A helicopter hovered overhead. In a series of tweets earlier Saturday, Trump doubted protesters’ allegiance to Floyd’s memory, saying they were “professionally managed.” He offered no evidence to back his assertion, and the president even seemed to invite supporters to make their presence felt: “Tonight, I understand, is MAGA NIGHT AT THE WHITE HOUSE???” Trump later rejected the suggestion that he was stoking a potential conflict between protesters and his supporters. “I was just asking. But I have no idea if they are going to be here,” he said. “MAGA is Make America Great Again. By the way, they love African American people. They love black people.” At Saturday’s demonstration, there was no evidence of a counter-move by Trump supporters. Trump said he had “watched every move” from inside the executive mansion during Friday’s protest and “couldn’t have felt more safe” as the Secret Service let the protesters carry on, “but whenever someone … got too frisky or out of line, they would quickly come down on then, hard — didn’t know what hit them.” The president also criticized the mayors of Washington and Minneapolis. Trump said Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey “is probably a very good person, but he’s a radical, left mayor.” He then described how he watched as a police station in the city was overrun. “For that police station to be abandoned and taken over, I’ve never seen anything so horrible and stupid in my life,” Trump said when speaking briefly to reporters at the White House. He said Minnesota officials have to get tougher with rioters, and that by doing so they would be honoring the memory of Floyd. The Secret Service said in a statement Saturday that six protesters were arrested in Washington and “multiple” officers were injured. There were no details on the charges or nature of the injuries. A spokesman for U.S. Park Police said their officers made no arrests, but several suffered minor injuries and one was taken to a hospital after being struck in the helmet by a projectile. Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf on Saturday called the protesters “criminals” who committed “acts of violence while hiding behind their First Amendment right of lawful protest.” Late Saturday and early Sunday, protesters vented their rage by breaking into tony shops of Georgetown, on the western edge of the District, and in downtown Washington, breaking windows and glass doors of many stores and looting some of them. In his tweeting, Trump claimed that many Secret Service agents were “just waiting for action” and ready to unleash “the most vicious dogs, and the most ominous weapons, I have ever seen.” His reference to “vicious dogs” potentially being sicced on protesters revisits images from the civil rights movement when marchers faced snarling police dogs and high-pressure fire hoses. In a news conference Saturday afternoon, Muriel Bowser, mayor of the nation’s capital, called Trump’s remarks “gross” and said the reference to attack dogs conjures up with the worst memories of the nation’s fight against segregation. “I call upon our city and our nation to exercise restraint, great restraint, even as the president tries to divide us,” she said. “I feel like these comments are an attack on humanity, an attack on black America, and they make my city less safe.” In contrast with the president’s tweets, the Secret Service said it “respects the right to assemble and we ask that individuals do so peacefully for the safety of all.” ___ AP video journalist Nathan Ellgren contributed to this report.",0.0

""It was not enough,"" Maj. Gen. Jon A. Jensen said Saturday. Now, with a fifth night of protests looming, Jensen, head of the state's National Guard, said authorities are drastically increasing the military presence in Minneapolis. Officials expected to deploy some 2,500 soldiers and airmen by midday Saturday and will soon mobilize the state's full National Guard force of more than 13,000 — ""an action that has never been taken in 164-year history of the Minnesota National Guard,"" according to Gov.

""But at this point in time, nothing we do to address those inequities, nothing we do to provide justice to George Floyd and his family that I spoke with last evening — none of those things matter to any of these people who are out there firing upon National Guard, burning businesses of our communities and making intent on disrupting any semblance of civil life.""

The white police officer — who has since been fired and charged with murder — continues to plant his weight on Floyd well after his pleas for help give way to an unresponsive silence. A federal investigation remains underway into the incident, with more charges possible for Chauvin and the three other officers seen in the video. That has not satisfied protesters, whose furor over Floyd's death has spread well beyond Minneapolis. A slew of cities — from Detroit to Atlanta, from Los Angeles to Washington, D.C. — have seen protesters gather to voice their outrage about police treatment of African Americans. In many of those cities, gatherings turned violent, with some protesters clashing with police and damaging buildings. Law enforcement reported hundreds of arrests across the country and at least one death — a 19-year-old man who was killed when someone fired into a crowd in Detroit, according to local police. Several people were also injured by gunfire Thursday night in Louisville, Ky., where crowds have gathered to protest a grievance closer to home: the death of Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old black woman who was shot and killed by police in her own apartment earlier this year. There were no incidents of gun violence linked to the protests Friday night in Louisville, but NPR member station WFPL reports that clashes erupted between protesters and police. Protesters shattered windows at the courthouse, and police fired tear gas to disperse the crowds, according to WFPL. On Saturday, Kentucky Gov.

Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) during a campaign event on March 2, 2020 in Dallas, Texas. Klobuchar has suspended her campaign and endorsed Biden before the upcoming Super Tuesday Democratic presidential primaries. (Photo by Ron Jenkins/Getty Images) Advertisement Biden ally sees Klobuchar as less likely Biden running mate Share Shares Copy Link Copy Sen. Amy Klobuchar seems a less likely choice to become Joe Biden's running mate on his presidential ticket following this week's death of a black man in police custody in Minneapolis, a key ally of the former vice president said Friday. Rep. James Clyburn, D-S.C., told reporters that while he believes Klobuchar is “absolutely” qualified to be vice president, “This is very tough timing for her.” Klobuchar, D-Minn., was a prosecutor years ago in the county that includes Minneapolis. As she was leaving the post to join the Senate, an officer involved in this week’s death of George Floyd was involved in the death of another man. The officer ultimately was not prosecuted. Clyburn, who said his view was his “gut feeling,” played a pivotal role in helping Biden become the party’s all-but-certain presidential nominee. Clyburn is the No. 3 House Democratic leader and Congress’ highest-ranking black lawmaker.Related: NY protesters demand justice for George Floyd“So often in politics, timing really dictates things, Barack Obama I don’t think could have gotten elected four years before he got elected,"" Clyburn said of the former president during a conference call. “And I don’t know whether he could get elected today.”On MSNBC, Biden said the tensions in Minnesota have “nothing to do with my running mate.” Pressed on whether Floyd’s killing increases pressure to place an African American woman on his ticket, Biden said he's talked about putting women of color on the Supreme Court and in his Cabinet. “And I also already said that there are women of color under consideration,"" he said. Clyburn helped revive Biden’s badly flagging presidential campaign earlier this year, lifting him to a decisive triumph in a South Carolina primary in which large numbers of voters were black. That fueled a Biden run to a string of victories in other state contests that resulted in his becoming the party’s presumptive nominee. Before being elected to the Senate in 2006, Klobuchar, who is white, was prosecutor of Minnesota's largest county, which includes Minneapolis. While Klobuchar was in that job, more than two dozen citizens died during encounters with police but none of the officers involved were criminally charged. Most victims were people of color, according to data compiled by Communities United Against Police Brutality and news articles reviewed by the AP. An officer involved in one of the past fatal incidents was Derek Chauvin, who was arrested and charged Friday in this week's death of Floyd. A video showing Floyd complaining that he could not breath as Chauvin kneeled on his neck has helped spark unrest in cities around the country. Chauvin was among six officers who fired on and killed a man in 2006 who reportedly stabbed two people and then aimed a shotgun at police. The case went to the grand jury after Klobuchar had been elected to the Senate and had left the county attorney’s office. Klobuchar did not respond to a request by The Associated Press for an interview on Friday. But she told NBC news that reports stating she had declined the case involving Chauvin years ago were “absolutely false.”Klobuchar told the network that during the years she led the office, it was the practice to present police shooting cases to a grand jury to consider charges. She said she now believes the practice of asking a grand jury to decide whether to charge officers was wrong. Klobuchar and 27 other Democratic senators wrote a letter Friday to the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division, asking it to investigate “patterns and practices of racially discriminatory and violent policing” by the Minneapolis police. ___AP reporters Sara Burnett in Chicago and Will Weissert in Washington contributed to this report.",0.0

NASA officials and others expressed hope the flight would lift American spirits and show the world what the U.S. can do. ""We are back in the game. It's very satisfying,"" said Doug Marshburn, of Deltona, Florida, who shouted, ""USA! USA!"" as he watched the 260-foot rocket climb skyward. SpaceX becomes the first private company to launch people into orbit, a feat achieved previously by only three governments: the U.S., Russia and China. ""This is something that should really get people right in the heart of anyone who has any spirit of exploration,"" Musk, the visionary also behind the Tesla electric car company, said after liftoff, pounding his chest with his fist. The flight also ended a nine-year launch drought for NASA. Ever since it retired the space shuttle in 2011, NASA has relied on Russian spaceships launched from Kazakhstan to take U.S. astronauts to and from the space station. Over the past few years, NASA outsourced the job of designing and building its next generation of spaceships to SpaceX and Boeing, awarding them $7 billion in contracts in a public-private partnership aimed at driving down costs and spurring innovation. Boeing's spaceship, the Starliner capsule, is not expected to fly astronauts until early 2021. NASA plans to rely in part on commercial partners as it pursues it next goals: sending astronauts back to the moon within a few years, and on to Mars in the 2030s. At a post-liftoff rally held at NASA's massive 525-foot-high Vehicle Assembly Building, President Donald Trump commended Musk and proclaimed: ""Today we once again proudly launch American astronauts on American rockets, the best in the world, from right here on American soil."" He vowed the U.S. will be the first to land on Mars, promising a ""future of American dominance in space."" Vice President Mike Pence, who also witnessed the launch, said that as the nation deals with the coronavirus and racial strife, ""I believe with all my heart that millions of Americans today will find the same inspiration and unity of purpose that we found in those days in the 1960s"" during Apollo. The first attempt to launch the rocket, on Wednesday, was called off with less than 17 minutes to go in the countdown because of lightning. On Saturday, stormy weather threatened another postponement for most of the day, but the skies began to clear just in the time. The astronauts set out for the launch pad in a gull-wing Tesla SUV after Behnken pantomimed a hug of his 6-year-old son, Theo, and said: ""Are you going to listen to Mommy and make her life easy?"" Hurley blew kisses to his 10-year-old son and wife. Nine minutes after liftoff, the rocket's first-stage booster landed, as designed, on a barge a few hundred miles off the Florida coast, to be reused on another flight. ""Thanks for the great ride to space,"" Hurley told SpaceX ground control. The two crewmates batted around a floating blue dinosaur plush toy doubling as a dragon, demonstrating that they had reached zero gravity. SpaceX controllers at Hawthorne, California, cheered and applauded wildly, and NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine declared: ""This is everything that America has to offer in its purest form."" Attendance inside Kennedy Space Center was strictly limited because of the coronavirus, and the crowd amounted to only a few thousand. By NASA's count, over 3 million viewers tuned in online. Despite NASA's insistence that the public stay safe by staying home, spectators flocked to beaches and roads, some of them not wearing masks or keeping 6 feet from others. Among the spectators was Neil Wight, a machinist from Buffalo, New York. ""With everything that's going on in this country right now, it's important that we do things extraordinary in life,"" he said. ""We've been bombarded with doom and gloom for the last six, eight weeks, whatever it is, and this is awesome. It brings a lot of people together."" Hurley, a 53-year-old retired Marine, and Behnken, 49, an Air Force colonel, are veterans of two space shuttle flights each. Because of the coronavirus, the astronauts were kept in quasi-quarantine for more than two months. The SpaceX technicians who helped them get into their spacesuits wore masks and gloves that made them look like black-clad ninjas. And the SpaceX controllers had masks and were seated far apart. In keeping with Musk's penchant for futuristic flash, the astronauts wore angular white uniforms with black trim. Instead of the usual multitude of dials, knobs and switches, the Dragon capsule has three large touchscreens. Once settled in orbit, Hurley disclosed that the capsule has been christened Endeavour, a storied name in the history of exploration, also given to one of the space shuttles. SpaceX has been launching cargo capsules to the space station since 2012. Under the new corporate-public model, aerospace companies design, build, own and operate spaceships, and NASA is essentially a paying customer on a list that could eventually include non-government researchers, artists and tourists. (Tom Cruise has already expressed interest.) Saturday's mission is technically considered a test flight. The next SpaceX voyage to the space station, set for the end of August, will have a full, four-person crew: three Americans and one Japanese. The first flight was originally targeted for around 2015. But the project encountered bureaucratic delays and technical setbacks. A SpaceX capsule exploded on the test stand last year. And Boeing's first Starliner capsule ended up in the wrong orbit and was nearly destroyed during a test flight in December. For SpaceX and the future of public-corporate space exploration, the stakes on Saturday were extraordinarily high. With the spaceship finally on its way, Musk got choked up talking about the weight of his responsibility for the astronauts' lives and their families and noted that the return to Earth is more dangerous in some ways than ascent, ""so we don't want to declare victory yet."" Still, Musk said he wasn't nervous about the launch on Saturday the way he was during the previous attempt. ""Today, I don't know, it felt like just the fates were aligned,"" he said. ___ Associated Press writers Jill Colvin and Mike Schneider in Cape Canaveral, Fla., contributed to this report. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Department of Science Education.

NASA’s Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken rode skyward aboard a white-and-black, bullet-shaped Dragon capsule on top of a Falcon 9 rocket, lifting off at 3:22 p.m. from the same launch pad used to send Apollo crews to the moon a half-century ago.

Tensions rose throughout the week and reached a crescendo Friday night as protests erupted in cities across America. On their smart phones, social media feeds and TVs, viewers saw the extremes in tactics play out all through the night Thursday and Friday, even as the majority of cops nationwide tried to keep the peace without retreating or shoving people to the ground. In Minneapolis, leaders decided to evacuate a police precinct Thursday and surrender it to protesters who set it on fire. Protesters also broke into the police headquarters Friday in Portland, Oregon, and ignited a fire. In New York, officers used batons and shoved protesters down as they took people into custody and cleared the streets. One video showed an officer slam a woman to the ground as he walked past her in the street. In Louisville, a police officer fired what appeared to be pepper balls at a news crew, and a clip of the video amassed more than 8 million views on Twitter in less than six hours. Los Angeles police arrested more than 500 protesters on Friday night. Minneapolis police and Mayor Jacob Frey have been sharply criticized for the noticeably non-confrontational strategy Thursday in handling the protests after Floyd’s death. Chauvin was arrested Friday and charged with murder. To some, the act of protesters taking over the evacuated Minneapolis precinct amid fires could stoke further flames. “You’ve got to defend that,” said former Los Angeles Police Deputy Chief Michael Downing. “That’s your command operation. Symbolically, it looks very bad if you have to give that up.” Downing would know: He witnessed the Los Angeles riots firsthand in 1992 following the acquittal of four officers accused of beating black motorist Rodney King. In Los Angeles, the center of the uprising was an intersection, Florence and Normandie avenues, and the violence spiraled into five days of riots and fires. More than 60 people died, including 10 who were fatally shot by law enforcement. ADVERTISEMENTSkip ................................................................ In 1992, then-Lt. Downing would typically oversee that intersection, but he was on vacation studying for a promotional exam. A different lieutenant was in charge instead. The lieutenant made a decision: He ordered his officers to abandon the intersection. An hour later, a truck driver was pulled from his vehicle and brutally beaten by rioters. “I think that sent a signal to the rest of the city,” said Downing, who immediately rushed to work. “When you have that coupled with political leadership saying ‘show your anger, go to the streets’ it was kind of like permission to go out and misbehave and be violent.” Nearly 30 years later, police officers around the country are confronted with an eerily similar dilemma, with cities aflame, violent protests erupting and another challenging night ahead Saturday as National Guard troops start arriving in some cities. The mere presence of armed National Guard troops on the streets in Minneapolis and elsewhere brings back memories of the civil rights and anti-war protests of the 1960s and ’70s, but they are only there as a support to local law enforcement and do not have the authority to make arrests. They can use their weapons in “self defense” but are trained in less lethal crowd control tactics that attempt to de-escalate tensions, unlike the combat techniques that have largely been abandoned since the Kent State University shootings in Ohio in 1970 when the state’s National Guard killed four students and wounded nine. Alex Vitale, a sociology professor at Brooklyn College, said that when deciding how to manage large protests, police and political leaders look for ways to facilitate “legitimate outpourings of anger” while trying to limit the likelihood of injury and property destruction. But he said the difficulty is trying to strike that balance. “The crisis of police legitimacy has become so great that then to use the police to manage the situation just enflames the problem,” said Vitale, who has studied the policing of protests for two decades.

In Minneapolis and other cities around the nation where high-profile police killings of black people have prompted protests, the rage felt by protesters is understandable, said Ed Gonzalez, sheriff of Harris County, Texas. “We keep promising real change but not delivering it on a consistent basis,” he said. “We see the resulting emotions and anger and calls for change that occur, only for it to happen again.” Edward Maguire, a criminology and criminal justice professor at Arizona State University whose research focuses primarily on policing and violence, said mass arrests are almost always a bad idea during protests. But so is not making arrests in the face of violence and property damage. He said police departments should be continuously engaged in building connections with minority communities, faith representatives and social justice leaders so that they have a degree of social capital and open communications when protests break out. In other recent protests, police found themselves in a similar situation as those on the front lines this week. Police were criticized in Baltimore and Charlottesville, Virginia, for taking too much of a hands-off approach during protests in 2015 and 2017. In Minneapolis, Frey said he made the decision to evacuate the third precinct that was later torched because of “imminent threats” to both officers and the public. “Brick and mortar is not as important as life,” Frey said. Even as law enforcement nationwide harshly condemned Chauvin’s actions in unprecedented language earlier in the week, they denounced the violence of the fiery protests and pleaded for calm. “You can’t allow anarchy just because this horrible injustice has occurred,” said Stephen Downing, Michael Downing’s father and also a retired LAPD deputy chief. “You can’t let your city burn. You just can’t.” ___ AP writer Sarah Rankin contributed to this report from Richmond, Virginia.",0.0

MINNEAPOLIS — First-term Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey appeared to be doing everything right. He worked with the city’s booming business community and the City Council. He reached out to minority neighborhoods and advocated for affordable housing. He implemented stricter disciplinary measures against police who violated the city’s body camera policy. When George Floyd, a handcuffed black man, died Monday after a white police officer pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes and ignored his “I can’t breathe” pleas, Frey quickly expressed outrage and called for charges against the officer. Four officers were fired the next day, and on Friday, Officer Derek Chauvin was charged in Floyd’s death. But Frey’s leadership is being questioned after police failed to quell several nights of rioting, fires and ransacking of local businesses that followed Floyd’s death. Frey, who pleaded for calm, also approved the decision to abandon the city’s 3rd Precinct station on Thursday night, surrendering it to protesters who set fire to the building. ADVERTISEMENTSkip ................................................................ The night the station burned, Frey appeared at an early-morning news conference after hours of criticism on social media for a police response that didn’t confront the violence despite the activation of the National Guard. As he began talking, one reporter snapped, “What’s the plan here?” Frey struggled to answer, and the next morning, Gov. Tim Walz — like Frey, a Democrat — criticized the “abject failure” of the city’s response and said the state had taken control. President Donald Trump took to Twitter to call Frey a “very weak Radical Left Mayor” and threatened to get involved. By early Saturday morning, it was Walz who found himself struggling with the enormity of the challenge, conceding that he didn’t have enough people to cope with the protests and moving to mobilize another 1,000 Guard members. Walz also took pains to praise Frey, who appeared alongside him after another night of unrest. Some wonder whether Frey’s approach to the crisis might damage his chances for reelection next year. The 38-year-old former lawyer, community organizer and one-term City Council member took office in 2018 after defeating Betsy Hodges, whose time as mayor was marred by two high-profile police shootings. The 2015 shooting of 24-year-old black resident Jamar Clark after a scuffle with two white police officers set off weeks of protests; neither officer was charged. The 2017 shooting of unarmed Australia native Justine Ruszczyk Damond, who had called 911 to report a possible sexual assault behind her house, provoked an international outcry. The black officer in that case was convicted of third-degree murder and is serving a 12 1/2-year term. Frey campaigned partly on a promise to add police officers. But a City Council committee this spring voted against applying for a federal grant to hire 10 new officers for traffic enforcement, with one member saying he worried it would exacerbate racial disparities in vehicle stops. Community activist Mel Reeves, who said he has led rallies to protest Floyd’s killing, refused to discuss the mayor’s response except to say that Frey had been “put in a difficult position.” He said the black community doesn’t trust police and prosecutors to do the right thing. “The mayor is new, and he said all the right things,” Reeves said. “This is not about the mayor; it’s about the police department.” The day after the 3rd Precinct fire, University of Minnesota political science professor Larry Jacobs said Frey was “out of his depth” and “clearly unable to understand what he has to do to restore order while also creating the kind of healing that has to happen in Minneapolis.” ADVERTISEMENTSkip ................................................................ He said abandoning the police station “sent a powerful message” that the city was not in control. “There needs to be another message: ‘Here is the line and order will be maintained,'” said Jacobs. “You’ve got businesses that are just shocked without words to see property going up in flames, often with no police intervention at all. You have the black community (that has) heard his words but does not believe them. “He worked really hard at those relationships and they appear to be in tatters. And I think a lot of residents are unnerved by the violence and the chaos.” Jonathan Weinhagen, president and CEO of the Minneapolis Regional Chamber, said the mayor still has his support, and that many businesses damaged by the violent protests, including those owned by minorities and immigrants, want to rebuild. “There is a lot of fear right now. If your store has been hit, you feel violated,” said Weinhagen, adding that some businesses already were suffering because of the coronavirus restrictions. “They were just beginning to see some light and this hit.” But he believes the mayor is “leading with his values” and getting a lot of things right, including requesting the Guard assistance and implementing a curfew Friday and Saturday nights. Jacobs, the political scientist, said Frey has been energetic, upbeat and dynamic, effectively leading the fast-growing city. But his inexperience with crisis management has shown. “Until about a week ago, he looked to be on glide path to reelection, and within a week, his mayorship looks like it’s crumbled,” Jacobs said. ___ Webber reported from Fenton, Michigan.",0.0

Their destination: the International Space Station, 250 miles above Earth. This marks NASA’s first human spaceflight launched from U.S. soil in nearly a decade. The mission has unfolded amid the gloom of the coronavirus outbreak, which has killed over 100,000 Americans, and racial unrest across the U.S. over the death of George Floyd, a handcuffed black man, at the hands of Minneapolis police. NASA officials and others held out hope the flight would would lift American spirits.

Veteran astronauts Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken are making the historic trip. At one point, weather threatened Saturday’s launch just as it did Wednesday when the countdown of the rocket and its bullet-shaped Dragon capsule was halted at just under 17 minutes because of the threat of lightning. President Donald Trump attended Saturday’s launch. NASA hired SpaceX and Boeing in 2014 to taxi astronauts to and from the space station, under contracts totaling $7 billion. Both companies launched their crew capsules last year with test dummies. SpaceX’s Dragon aced all of its objectives, while Boeing’s Starliner capsule ended up in the wrong orbit and was almost destroyed because of software errors. As a result, the first Starliner flight carrying astronauts isn’t expected until next year. (The Associated Press contributed to this report)",0.0

Some pulled an American flag from a nearby building and threw it into the blaze. Others added branches pulled from trees. A cinder block structure, on the north side of the park, that had bathrooms and a maintenance office, was engulfed in flames.Several miles north, a separate protest broke out in Northwest D.C., near the Maryland border. The Metropolitan Police Department says there were break-ins at a Target and a shopping center that houses Neiman Marcus, Saks Fifth Avenue Men’s Store, T.J.

An Associated Press photographer saw police then begin firing many 40 millimeter canisters of tear gas toward the crowd. People were choking, gasping and some throwing up as they scattered, leaving only a few still in the streets.As police and National Guard troops took up positions with plastic shields on major streets, crowds melted away.

""So I don't see a distinction any different."" Chauvin was charged with third-degree murder and second degree manslaughter. Three other officers were also fired from the department in relation to the incident.

Still, the incidents provoked concern from a range of advocacy groups.""Journalists have a clear First Amendment right to cover public events,"" Freedom of the Press Foundation advocacy director Parker Higgins said in a statement.CNN reporter describes arrest, power of capturing something on videoIn Louisville, Kentucky, where protesters have been calling for accountability for a black woman who was fatally shot by police in March, reporters for WLKY were targeted by protesters on Friday night. A WLKY news vehicle was destroyed and a videojournalist ""was attacked so badly he had to go to the ER,"" anchor Julie Dolan said on Twitter.An officer there also fired what appeared to be pepper balls at a reporter for WAVE 3 News. The incident was broadcast live on the air. ""Who are they aiming that at?"" the anchor asked. ""At us,"" the reporter replied.The reporter, Kaitlin Rust, and her cameraman were ""courageously and lawfully"" covering the news when they were targeted, the station said in a statement. ""There is simply no justification for the Louisville police to wantonly open fire, even with pepper balls, on any journalists under any circumstances.""Louisville Metro Police Special Advisor Jessie Halladay issued an apology to Rust. Halladay said she had reviewed the video and said the incident was not something that should have occurred if Rust was singled out as a reporter.Many TV networks are dispatching private security guards to support journalists who are in the field at protests.""These situations could have been much worse had it not been for security,"" Dolan said.Security guards were involved when a Fox News crew was harassed and chased out of Lafayette Park, one block from the White House, on Friday night. Videos of the incident showed protesters cursing at Fox and criticizing right-wing media.Correspondent Leland Vittert, cameraman Christian Galdabini and two security guards left the park as the crowd grew more and more hostile. According to Fox, ""Vittert and the crew were punched and hit with projectiles as they fled, and a Fox News camera was broken when a member of the mob tried to grab it.""Journalists from rival outlets supported the Fox crew and condemned the violence. CNN anchor Jake Tapper called it an ""unacceptable assault on freedom of the press.""CBS correspondent Ed O'Keefe wrote on Twitter, ""Whether it's police officers or everyday Americans — keep your hands, weapons and handcuffs off of *any* journalist exercising their First Amendment right to report the news. Period.""Fox News Media CEO Suzanne Scott said in a Saturday memo, obtained by CNN Business, that the company is taking ""all necessary security precautions to safeguard all of our journalists and reporting crews.""Journalists in several cities said they were exposed to tear gas and other materials used to disperse crowds.In Minneapolis, photographer and author Linda Tirado said on Twitter that she was blinded in her left eye. What ""we think happened is I took a rubber bullet to the face,"" she wrote. ""It exploded my eyeball, which has now been patched back together but who knows if it'll need more surgery. My vision is gone no matter what it winds up looking like scar wise.""In Denver, a crew from KMGH TV reported being hit with paintballs and tear gas.In Phoenix, reporter Briana Whitney was accosted by a protester while she was live on the air.""I was intentionally tackled by this man while I was on air trying to report what was happening during the protest at Phoenix PD headquarters,"" she said at the end of the night. ""I feel violated, and this was terrifying.""In Las Vegas, two photojournalists on assignment to cover protests were taken into police custody on Friday night.Photographer Bridget Bennett told CNN Business that she was detained along with another photojournalist at the protest location. ""I'm a freelance photojournalist and was working on assignment for AFP. I was released this morning,"" Bennett said. She declined further comment.Ellen Schmidt, a staff photojournalist at the Las Vegas Review-Journal, was also arrested.Review-Journal executive editor Glenn Cook said in an email message, ""it is appalling that Las Vegas police officers, who have nothing to do with what happened in Minnesota, would so forcefully take into custody two people who were obviously working photojournalists and posed no threat to law enforcement or public safety. They never should have been touched, let alone arrested and then booked into jail.""On Saturday morning, the recovery efforts began. At CNN Center, the network's flagship building in Atlanta, protesters' graffiti on the CNN logo was removed. An internal memo reassured staffers that everyone at the building was safe.UN secretary general António Guterres was moved to post a message defending the rights of the press.""When journalists are attacked, societies are attacked,"" he tweeted Saturday morning.

More than 500 mourners wearing masks against the coronavirus packed a Houston church a little more than two weeks after Floyd was pinned to the pavement by a white Minneapolis police officer who put a knee on his neck for what prosecutors said was 8 minutes and 46 seconds. Cellphone video of the encounter, including Floyd’s pleas of “I can’t breathe,” ignited protests and scattered violence across the U.S. and around the world, turning the 46-year-old Floyd — a man who in life was little known beyond the public housing project where he was raised in Houston’s Third Ward — into a worldwide symbol of injustice. “Third Ward, Cuney Homes, that’s where he was born at,” Floyd’s brother, Rodney, told mourners at the Fountain of Praise church. “But everybody is going to remember him around the world. He is going to change the world.” The funeral capped six days of mourning for Floyd in three cities: Raeford, North Carolina, near where he was born; Houston, where he grew up; and Minneapolis, where he died. The memorials have drawn the families of other black victims whose names have become familiar in the debate over race and justice — among them, Eric Garner, Michael Brown, Ahmaud Arbery and Trayvon Martin. ___ Heat, rain, long lines: Georgia election plagued by problems ATLANTA (AP) — Voters endured heat, pouring rain and waits as long as five hours on Tuesday to cast ballots in Georgia, demonstrating a fierce desire to participate in the democratic process while raising questions about the emerging battleground state’s ability to manage elections in November when the White House is at stake. “It’s really disheartening to see a line like this in an area with predominantly black residents,” said Benaiah Shaw, a 25-year-old African American, as he cast a ballot in Atlanta. A confluence of events disrupted primary elections for president, U.S. Senate and dozens of other contests. There were problems with Georgia’s new voting machines, which combine touchscreens with scanned paper ballots. The polls were staffed by fewer workers because of coronavirus concerns. A reduced workforce contributed to officials consolidating polling places, which disproportionately affected neighborhoods with high concentrations of people of color. Long lines were also reported in whiter suburban areas. Some voters said they requested mail-in ballots that never arrived, forcing them to go to polling places and adding to the lines. Turnout, meanwhile, may be higher than expected as voters said they were determined to exercise their constitutional right after the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis and the ensuing demonstrations that swept cities including Atlanta. “Too many people died for me to have this opportunity,” said Stephanie Bush, a 49-year-old black independent voter in Atlanta. “So for me not to stick it out would be a dishonor to them.” ___ Video evidence increasingly disproves police narratives Minneapolis police initially told the public that George Floyd died after a “medical incident during a police interaction.” The Buffalo, New York, department said a protester “tripped and fell.” Philadelphia police alleged that a college student who suffered a serious head wound had assaulted an officer. All three claims were quickly disproved by videos seen widely on the internet and television, fueling mistrust and embarrassing agencies that made misleading or incomplete statements that painted their actions in a far more favorable light. Police departments deny lying but acknowledge sometimes making mistakes when releasing information in fast-moving, complicated situations. The videos, they say, do not always capture officers’ perspectives. Defense lawyers say the inaccurate statements are encouraged by a culture of silence in which officers protect misbehaving colleagues, a court system that rarely holds officers accountable and a public that has given police the benefit of the doubt. Floyd died after a white officer put his knee on his neck, even after Floyd stopped moving. Cellphone video showed him pleading for air as other officers stood by and bystanders urged the police to help him. ___ Human remains found at property of man tied to missing kids BOISE, Idaho (AP) — Authorities said they uncovered human remains at an Idaho man’s home Tuesday as they investigated the disappearance of his new wife’s two children — a case that’s drawn global attention for its ties to two other mysterious deaths and the couple’s doomsday beliefs. Chad Daybell, who married the children’s mother, Lori Vallow Daybell, was arrested on suspicion of concealing or destroying evidence after local and federal investigators searched his property, according to the Fremont County Sheriff’s Office. He has not yet been formally charged, and his attorney, Mark Means, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Joshua “JJ” Vallow, who was 7 when he vanished, and 17-year-old Tylee Ryan haven’t been seen since September, and police say Chad and Lori Daybell lied to investigators about the children’s whereabouts before quietly leaving Idaho. They were found in Hawaii months later. Besides the missing children, the couple has been under scrutiny following the deaths of both of their former spouses. Police from the small town of Rexburg, the FBI and sheriff’s investigators searched Chad Daybell’s home in the eastern Idaho town of Salem for the second time, bringing in backhoes and setting up tents in a nearby field. The search warrant is sealed, and Rexburg Assistant Police Chief Gary Hagan said he couldn’t reveal details other than the search is linked to the children’s disappearance. “Throughout the investigation, detectives and investigators have recovered what’s believed to be human remains that have not been identified at this time,” Hagan said in a news conference. ___ Officials back off removing temporary fencing at White House The Trump administration appears to be retreating from its commitment to quickly remove most of a new fence blocking demonstrators and other members of the public from in front of the White House. Instead, National Park Service spokeswoman Katie Liming says only that her agency is in “continuing discussions” with the Secret Service about what Liming called the temporary security fencing at the front of the White House. Officials abruptly erected the high, black metal fence last week to block demonstrators from Lafayette Square outside the White House. That was as massive crowds rallied in Washington and around the country to protest the killing of George Floyd in police custody, and other deaths of African Americans at the hands of police. Members of the park service’s U.S. Park Police and other security forces lobbed chemical agents and punched and clubbed demonstrators and journalists in clearing Lafayette Square near the White House on June 1, just before crews raised the new fence. Trump administration officials have denied federal forces at the time of the forceful removal of crowds were making way for President Donald Trump to stage photos nearby. Lafayette Square has historically been one of the country’s most prominent spots for demonstrations and other public advocacy, ___ New York passes bill to unveil police discipline records ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) — New York state lawmakers repealed a decades-old law Tuesday that has kept law enforcement officers’ disciplinary records secret, spurred by the national uproar over the death of George Floyd. The measure to make officers’ records and misconduct complaints public is among several police accountability bills racing through the state legislature. Lawmakers passed other bills that would provide all state troopers with body cameras and ensure that police officers provide medical and mental health attention to people in custody. Many of those bills were first proposed years ago, but got new momentum after huge protests nationwide condemned police brutality. The passage came as criminal charges were brought Tuesday against an NYPD officer over his rough treatment of a protester during demonstrations following the death of Floyd, who pleaded he couldn’t breathe as a white Minneapolis police officer pressed a knee on his neck May 25. Eliminating the law, known as Section 50-a, would make complaints against officers, as well as transcripts and final dispositions of disciplinary proceedings, public for the first time in decades. ___ Movie theaters, shuttered for months, plan July reopening NEW YORK (AP) — After three months of near total blackout of cinemas nationwide, movie theaters are preparing to reopen — even if it means only a few titles on the marquee and showings limited to as little as 25% capacity. AMC Theaters, the world’s largest theater operator, said Tuesday that it expects to have 97-98% of its theaters worldwide reopened by mid-July. The National Association of Theater Owners, the trade group that represents exhibitors, expects some 90-95% of cinemas around the world will be opened by mid-July. A lot is still “fluid,” as AMC Entertainment’s chief executive, Adam Aron, said in a call Tuesday with investors. But provided flare ups of the coronavirus don’t unmake plans, the industry is gearing up for a dramatic resumption of widespread business just in time for Christopher Nolan’s “Tenet.” The Warner Bros. thriller, the latest from arguably Hollywood’s most passionate defender of the big-screen experience, is slated for release July 17. Warner Bros. didn’t comment late Tuesday, and the most recent trailer for “Tenet” was notably vague on its release date. But theater owners are cautiously optimistic that “Tenet” will hold where it is. Aron said that AMC’s conversations as recent as Monday with Warner Bros. and Disney, which has “Mulan” slated for July 24, have been reassuring. The larger question might be whether moviegoers feel safe returning to theaters. Health officials have warned that large indoor gatherings are risky. Broadway theaters will remain dark through at least early September. It will be up to movie theater operators to convince moviegoers that it’s safe to once again sit in the dark among strangers. ___ Confusion reigns as UN scrambles mask, virus spread advice LONDON (AP) — It’s an issue that’s been argued about for months, both by experts and by people strolling through parks all over the world: Can people who don’t feel sick spread the coronavirus, and if so should we all be wearing masks to stop it? Even the World Health Organization can’t seem to get it straight. On Tuesday the U.N. health agency scrambled to explain seemingly contradictory comments it has made in recent days about the two related issues. The confusion and mixed messages only makes controlling the pandemic that much more difficult, experts say. “If you are giving them confusing messages or they’re not convinced about why they should do something, like wear masks, they will just ignore you,” said Ivo Vlaev, a professor of behavioral sciences at the University of Warwick. The communications debacle highlighted WHO’s change to its longstanding mask advice — a revision that was made months after many other organizations and countries already recommended people don masks. ___ IBM quits facial recognition, joins call for police reforms IBM is getting out of the facial recognition business, saying it’s concerned about how the technology can be used for mass surveillance and racial profiling. Ongoing protests responding to the death of George Floyd have sparked a broader reckoning over racial injustice and a closer look at the use of police technology to track demonstrators and monitor American neighborhoods. IBM is one of several big tech firms that had earlier sought to improve the accuracy of their face-scanning software after research found racial and gender disparities. But its new CEO is now questioning whether it should be used by police at all. “We believe now is the time to begin a national dialogue on whether and how facial recognition technology should be employed by domestic law enforcement agencies,” wrote CEO Arvind Krishna in a letter sent Monday to U.S. lawmakers. IBM’s decision to stop building and selling facial recognition software is unlikely to affect its bottom line, since the tech giant is increasingly focused on cloud computing while an array of lesser-known firms have cornered the market for government facial recognition contracts. ___ 4 ‘Vanderpump’ regulars ousted over slurs, racial profiling NEW YORK (AP) — Four cast members are not returning for another season of Bravo’s “Vanderpump Rules” — two over their racist social media posts, and the others after they racially profiled a coworker. Bravo released a statement Tuesday confirming that Stassi Schroeder, Kristen Doute, Max Boyens and Brett Caprioni would not return to the reality series, which will air its final episode of season eight next week. The show follows the personal lives of current and former employees of former “Real Housewives of Beverly Hills” star Lisa Vanderpump’s Los Angeles restaurants. It was revealed last week on a podcast that Schroeder and Doute had reported a former African American coworker, Faith Stowers, for a crime she had nothing to do with. Stowers appeared on two seasons of “Vanderpump.” Boyens and Caprioni were let go over past tweets that contained racial slurs.",0.0

At least one person is dead after being shot in Indianapolis. Police are investigating whether the incident was connected to demonstrations in the city. In Los Angeles, protesters blocked the 110 freeway downtown and were seen breaking windows of stores at The Grove mall. Floyd, 46, died after being arrested in Minneapolis on Monday. A video shows a police officer kneeling on his neck for at least seven minutes while Floyd is heard saying he cannot breathe. That police officer was arrested Friday and charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. Three other officers were present but have not been charged. All four were fired. Overnight curfews were enacted in cities nationwide — including Chicago, Atlanta, Los Angeles, Louisville, San Francisco and Denver — as authorities sought to stem any violence. The National Guard was also activated in several states, including Texas, Georgia, Washington, Ohio and Kentucky. In Minneapolis, authorities reported a ratcheting down of the previous night's unrest after an influx of National Guard troops and state troopers were dispatched to the city. ""Clearly we did not have the numbers in [Minneapolis police] alone,"" the city's mayor, Jacob Frey told Minnesota Public Radio early Sunday. ""Additional force was necessary."" Law enforcement began to make arrests in Minneapolis after an 8 p.m. curfew as crowds gathered at the 5th Precinct police building. Paul Schnell, the state corrections commissioner, said at a Saturday night press conference that an official count of arrests was not yet available but that authorities were ""committed to do whatever it takes to bring order."" Former Vice President and presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden released a statement early Sunday morning condemning the violence and urging Americans to ""take care of each other."" ""Protesting such brutality is right and necessary. It's an utterly American response,"" he wrote. ""But burning down communities and needless destruction is not."" We are a nation in pain, but we must not allow this pain to destroy us. We are a nation enraged, but we cannot allow our rage to consume us. Please stay safe. Please take care of each other. https://t.co/Y224rANwUF — Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) May 31, 2020 Biden added, ""the act of protesting should never be allowed to overshadow the reason we protest."" 1 person fatally shot in Indianapolis At least one person has died after being shot in downtown Indianapolis Saturday night. Police Chief Randal Taylor said at a press conference that authorities were still investigating the incident's connection to ongoing demonstrations in the city. ""Downtown is not safe at this time,"" Taylor said. He urged residents who do not live in the area to leave. Mayor Joe Hogsett called the day's protests ""successful"" in a tweet, but condemned the ""small group of people"" that grew violent later in the night. This afternoon, our city hosted a successful protest that allowed hundreds to lift up their cause and have their voices safely heard.  Since it ended, a small group of people have chosen to diminish that activism through inexcusable violence. It is unacceptable, and it must stop. — Mayor Joe Hogsett (@IndyMayorJoe) May 31, 2020 Police cruisers seen going through crowds in New York Several videos of protests in New York showed a police patrol vehicle driving through crowds of protesters. Protesters are seen surrounding and throwing debris at a car while another one drove into them. Mayor Bill de Blasio called the footage ""upsetting"" at a late night press conference Saturday but said it was ""inappropriate for protesters to surround a police vehicle and threaten police officers."" He addressed the city's peaceful protesters, saying they were heard but urging them to go home. ""We hear your desire to see these issues: relationship between police and community, the need for justice, the need for real change in our society,"" he said. ""We appreciate and respect all peaceful protests, but it is now time for people to go home."" California governor declares state of emergency in LA County Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti requested assistance to restore order Saturday night amid protests. A curfew began at 8 p.m. PT and is expected to end at 5:30 a.m. local time. The LAPD said hundreds of protesters were arrested amid the protests. An unlawful assembly was declared in the the Mid-Wilshire area and businesses were asked to close. Protesters blocked the 110 freeway in downtown LA and videos taken at protests showed looting and broken windows at stores in The Grove mall. Garcetti urged protesters to ""take a breath"" and ""step away"" at a press conference. He asked residents to go home and protest peacefully at a later time. We will always protect free speech and Angelenos’ right to live without fear of violence or vandalism. To increase safety for demonstrators, law enforcement and all citizens of Los Angeles, we are putting a curfew in place from 8 p.m. to 5 a.m. https://t.co/vy3XM760qb — MayorOfLA (@MayorOfLA) May 30, 2020 Gov.

Demonstrators flocked to the White House and nearby Lafayette Square throughout the afternoon where city and U.S. Park police and the Secret Service maintained barricades and pushed back against protesters, at times using pepper spray in an attempt to disperse crowds. Fireworks were set off and at least one car was set on fire. Buildings in downtown Washington had windows smashed — including the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute and an Apple store. A liquor store and a T-Mobile were also looted as tensions remained high through the early morning. The D.C. police union tweeted that one of its members had been hospitalized after being hit by a rock. We can confirm that at least one member has been hospitalized after being struck with a rock. — DC Police Union (@DCPoliceUnion) May 31, 2020 Earlier on Saturday, President Trump falsely accused the city's mayor, Muriel Bowser, of refusing to let D.C. police assist in containing Friday night's demonstrations. Bowser fired back at Trump at a Saturday press conference, saying the president's warning that ""ominous weapons"" and ""vicious dogs"" awaited any protester who made it past the White House fence was ""no subtle reminder"" of the country's history of segregationist violence. On Sunday morning, Bowser reiterated that sentiment on NBC's Meet The Press. ""I think the president has a responsibility to help calm the nation and he can start by not sending divisive tweets that are meant to harken to the segregationist past of our country and he can start by doing that right now,"" Bowser said. This is a developing story. Some things reported by the media will turn out to be wrong. We will focus on reports from officials and other authorities, credible news outlets and reporters who are at the scene. We will update as the situation develops. ",0.0

In Minneapolis, a tanker truck driver drove into a massive crowd of demonstrators nearly a week after the death of George Floyd, a black man who pleaded for air as an officer pressed a knee into his neck. No protesters appeared to be injured, and the driver was arrested. Tensions spiked outside the White House, the scene of three days of demonstrations, where police fired tear gas and stun grenades into a crowd of more than 1,000 chanting protesters across the street in Lafayette Park. The crowd ran away and piled up road signs and plastic barriers to light a raging fire in a nearby street. Some pulled an American flag from a building and threw it into the blaze. A building in the park with bathrooms and a maintenance office went up in flames and people broke into banks and jewelry stores. As demonstrations persisted past curfew, Washington police said they were responding to multiple fires set around the capital. The entire Washington, D.C., National Guard — roughly 1,700 soldiers — was called in to help control the protests, according to two Defense Department officials who insisted on anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the matter. As the protests grew, President Donald Trump retweeted conservative commentator Buck Sexton who called for “overwhelming force” against violent demonstrators. Secret Service agents had rushed Trump to a White House bunker on Friday night as hundreds of protesters gathered outside the executive mansion, some of them throwing rocks and tugging at police barricades. The president spent nearly an hour in the bunker designed for use in emergencies like terrorist attacks, according to a Republican close to the White House who was not authorized to publicly discuss private matters and spoke on condition of anonymity. The account was confirmed by an administration official who also spoke on condition of anonymity. Former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, visited the site of protests in his hometown of Wilmington, Delaware, and talked to some of the demonstrators. He also wrote a post on Medium expressing empathy for those despairing about the killing of George Floyd. At least 4,400 people have been arrested over days of protests, according to a tally compiled by The Associated Press. Arrests ranged from stealing and blocking highways to breaking curfew. ADVERTISEMENTSkip ................................................................ In Salt Lake City, an activist leader condemned the destruction of property but said broken buildings shouldn’t be mourned on the same level as black men like Floyd. “Maybe this country will get the memo that we are sick of police murdering unarmed black men,” said Lex Scott, founder of Black Lives Matter Utah. “Maybe the next time a white police officer decides to pull the trigger, he will picture cities burning.” Yet thousands still marched peacefully in Phoenix, Albuquerque and other cities, with some calling for an end to the fires, vandalism and theft, saying it weakened calls for justice and reform. “They keep killing our people,” said Mahira Louis, 15, who marched with her mother and several hundred others in a peaceful protest through downtown Boston. “I’m so sick and tired of it.” But as night fell that demonstration also descended into violence, with some protesters throwing rocks, bricks and glass bottles at officers and lighting a police vehicle on fire. In downtown Atlanta, authorities fired tear gas to disperse hundreds of demonstrators. Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said two officers had been fired and three placed on desk duty after video showed police surrounding a car Saturday, then pulling a woman out of the passenger seat and appearing to use a stun gun on a man who was driving. Police Chief Erika Shields called it “really shocking to watch.” In downtown Los Angeles, a police SUV accelerated into several protesters in a street, knocking two people to the ground. The pair got up and ran onto the sidewalk. Nearby in Santa Monica, not far from a peaceful demonstration, a group broke into a Gap and a Vans sneaker store, where people walked out with boxes of shoes. Others shattered the windows of an REI outdoor supply store and snatched folding chairs, a bike and backpacks. A fire broke out at a restaurant across the street. ADVERTISEMENTSkip ................................................................ About 30 miles (48 kilometers) south, as hundreds of protesters gathered in Long Beach, scores of thieves swarmed into nearby outlet stores. A steady stream emerged from a Forever 21 store carrying armloads of clothing. Some hauled it away in garbage bags, and a few stopped outside to change into stolen items. In Minneapolis, the officer who pressed his knee onto Floyd’s neck has been charged with murder, but protesters are demanding the other three officers at the scene be prosecuted. All four were fired. “We’re not done,” said Darnella Wade, an organizer for Black Lives Matter in neighboring St. Paul, where thousands gathered peacefully in front of the state Capitol as state patrolmen and National Guard soldiers lined up in front of about a dozen military-style armored vehicles. “They sent us the military, and we only asked them for arrests.” Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz brought in thousands of National Guard soldiers on Saturday to help quell violence that had damaged or destroyed hundreds of buildings in Minneapolis over days of protests. That appeared to help minimize unrest both Saturday and Sunday. Disgust over generations of racism in a country founded by slaveholders combined with a string of recent racially charged killings to stoke the anger. Adding to that was angst from months of lockdowns brought on by the coronavirus pandemic, which has disproportionately hurt communities of color, not only in terms of infections but in job losses and economic stress. The droves of people congregating for demonstrations threatened to trigger new outbreaks, a fact overshadowed by the boiling tensions. The scale of the coast-to-coast protests rivaled the historic demonstrations of the civil rights and Vietnam War eras. Curfews were imposed in major cities around the U.S., including Atlanta, Chicago, Denver, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Seattle. About 5,000 National Guard soldiers and airmen were activated in 15 states and Washington, D.C. ADVERTISEMENTSkip ................................................................ In Indianapolis, two people were reported dead in bursts of downtown violence this weekend, adding to deaths reported in Detroit and Minneapolis in recent days. In tweets Sunday, Trump blamed anarchists and the media for fueling violence. Attorney General William Barr pointed a finger at “far left extremist” groups. Police chiefs and politicians accused outsiders of coming in and causing the problems. At the Minneapolis intersection where Floyd was killed, people gathered with brooms and flowers, saying it was important to protect what they called a “sacred space.” Among in Minneapolis was Michael Brown Sr., the father of Michael Brown, whose killing by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, set off unrest in 2014. “I understand what this family is feeling. I understand what this community is feeling,” he said. ___ Morrison and Sullivan reported from Minneapolis.

At least one person is dead after being shot in Indianapolis. Police are investigating whether the incident was connected to demonstrations in the city. In Los Angeles, protesters blocked the 110 freeway downtown and were seen breaking windows of stores at The Grove mall. Floyd, 46, died after being arrested in Minneapolis on Monday. A video shows a police officer kneeling on his neck for at least seven minutes while Floyd is heard saying he cannot breathe. That police officer was arrested Friday and charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. Three other officers were present but have not been charged. All four were fired. Overnight curfews were enacted in cities nationwide — including Chicago, Atlanta, Los Angeles, Louisville, San Francisco and Denver — as authorities sought to stem any violence. The National Guard was also activated in several states, including Texas, Georgia, Washington, Ohio and Kentucky. In Minneapolis, authorities reported a ratcheting down of the previous night's unrest after an influx of National Guard troops and state troopers were dispatched to the city. ""Clearly we did not have the numbers in [Minneapolis police] alone,"" the city's mayor, Jacob Frey told Minnesota Public Radio early Sunday. ""Additional force was necessary."" Law enforcement began to make arrests in Minneapolis after an 8 p.m. curfew as crowds gathered at the 5th Precinct police building. Paul Schnell, the state corrections commissioner, said at a Saturday night press conference that an official count of arrests was not yet available but that authorities were ""committed to do whatever it takes to bring order."" Former Vice President and presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden released a statement early Sunday morning condemning the violence and urging Americans to ""take care of each other."" ""Protesting such brutality is right and necessary. It's an utterly American response,"" he wrote. ""But burning down communities and needless destruction is not."" We are a nation in pain, but we must not allow this pain to destroy us. We are a nation enraged, but we cannot allow our rage to consume us. Please stay safe. Please take care of each other. https://t.co/Y224rANwUF — Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) May 31, 2020 Biden added, ""the act of protesting should never be allowed to overshadow the reason we protest."" 1 person fatally shot in Indianapolis At least one person has died after being shot in downtown Indianapolis Saturday night. Police Chief Randal Taylor said at a press conference that authorities were still investigating the incident's connection to ongoing demonstrations in the city. ""Downtown is not safe at this time,"" Taylor said. He urged residents who do not live in the area to leave. Mayor Joe Hogsett called the day's protests ""successful"" in a tweet, but condemned the ""small group of people"" that grew violent later in the night. This afternoon, our city hosted a successful protest that allowed hundreds to lift up their cause and have their voices safely heard.  Since it ended, a small group of people have chosen to diminish that activism through inexcusable violence. It is unacceptable, and it must stop. — Mayor Joe Hogsett (@IndyMayorJoe) May 31, 2020 Police cruisers seen going through crowds in New York Several videos of protests in New York showed a police patrol vehicle driving through crowds of protesters. Protesters are seen surrounding and throwing debris at a car while another one drove into them. Mayor Bill de Blasio called the footage ""upsetting"" at a late night press conference Saturday but said it was ""inappropriate for protesters to surround a police vehicle and threaten police officers."" He addressed the city's peaceful protesters, saying they were heard but urging them to go home. ""We hear your desire to see these issues: relationship between police and community, the need for justice, the need for real change in our society,"" he said. ""We appreciate and respect all peaceful protests, but it is now time for people to go home."" California governor declares state of emergency in LA County Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti requested assistance to restore order Saturday night amid protests. A curfew began at 8 p.m. PT and is expected to end at 5:30 a.m. local time. The LAPD said hundreds of protesters were arrested amid the protests. An unlawful assembly was declared in the the Mid-Wilshire area and businesses were asked to close. Protesters blocked the 110 freeway in downtown LA and videos taken at protests showed looting and broken windows at stores in The Grove mall. Garcetti urged protesters to ""take a breath"" and ""step away"" at a press conference. He asked residents to go home and protest peacefully at a later time. We will always protect free speech and Angelenos’ right to live without fear of violence or vandalism. To increase safety for demonstrators, law enforcement and all citizens of Los Angeles, we are putting a curfew in place from 8 p.m. to 5 a.m. https://t.co/vy3XM760qb — MayorOfLA (@MayorOfLA) May 30, 2020 Gov.

Demonstrators flocked to the White House and nearby Lafayette Square throughout the afternoon where city and U.S. Park police and the Secret Service maintained barricades and pushed back against protesters, at times using pepper spray in an attempt to disperse crowds. Fireworks were set off and at least one car was set on fire. Buildings in downtown Washington had windows smashed — including the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute and an Apple store. A liquor store and a T-Mobile were also looted as tensions remained high through the early morning. The D.C. police union tweeted that one of its members had been hospitalized after being hit by a rock. We can confirm that at least one member has been hospitalized after being struck with a rock. — DC Police Union (@DCPoliceUnion) May 31, 2020 Earlier on Saturday, President Trump falsely accused the city's mayor, Muriel Bowser, of refusing to let D.C. police assist in containing Friday night's demonstrations. Bowser fired back at Trump at a Saturday press conference, saying the president's warning that ""ominous weapons"" and ""vicious dogs"" awaited any protester who made it past the White House fence was ""no subtle reminder"" of the country's history of segregationist violence. On Sunday morning, Bowser reiterated that sentiment on NBC's Meet The Press. ""I think the president has a responsibility to help calm the nation and he can start by not sending divisive tweets that are meant to harken to the segregationist past of our country and he can start by doing that right now,"" Bowser said. This is a developing story. Some things reported by the media will turn out to be wrong. We will focus on reports from officials and other authorities, credible news outlets and reporters who are at the scene. We will update as the situation develops. ",0.0

About 20 states have seen decreases in recent days, and eight states are holding steady. One of the states with the biggest spikes in new cases is Florida. The number of new cases reported each day has increased an average of roughly 46% over the past week, just as most of the state entered a second phase of reopening.While big cities on the coasts were hit hard early in the pandemic, the past few weeks have seen wider spread in inland states, including Arkansas, Texas and Arizona.In Utah, state Rep. Suzanne Harrison called a recent spike of cases ""very concerning (and) approaching exponential.""""Today's 18.5% positive test rate is double yesterday's (9.4%),"" she tweeted over the weekend.Friday, health officials in Utah said they were ""very concerned"" about the rise in new cases over the past week.The state has recorded more than 12,000 infections, according to Johns Hopkins.Health officials raise concerns of virus spreading among protestsHealth officials have raised concern about coronavirus spread as thousands of people are now braving a pandemic to participate in the national protests sparked by the death of George Floyd.The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Sunday it was closely monitoring the demonstrations taking place across the U.S. and warned such gatherings could spur coronavirus transmission. Some states are already seeing upward trends of new cases.For three months, the country passed one grim milestone after the other, hitting 100,000 coronavirus deaths in late May. Public health officials have said without the lockdowns that most states put in place, that death toll could have been significantly higher.As those lockdowns were lifted and other measures were loosened, the CDC and other top health officials urged Americans to use face coverings when they go out and always maintain a distance.But the large protests make it hard to keep the recommended social distancing guidelines and ""may put others at risk,"" CDC spokesperson Kristen Nordlund said in a statement.""It is too early to know what, if any, effect these events will have on the federal COVID-19 response. Every local situation is different. State and local officials will make decisions to protect public health and safety based on circumstances on the ground,"" she said.Earlier this month, CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield said protesters should be evaluated and tested for the virus.""I do think there is a potential, unfortunately, for this to be a seeding event,"" he said — especially in metropolitan areas where there has been significant transmission.So far, more than 1,942,000 people have been infected in the U.S., and at least 110,514 have died, according to Johns Hopkins University.Some states see rise in new casesWhile the early parts of the outbreak in the country hit dense metropolitan areas on the coast the hardest — including California and New York — the past few weeks have seen wider spread in inland states, including Arkansas, Texas and Arizona.In Harris County, Texas, health officials said they identified a nursing home with both cases of the virus and deaths.On Friday, health officials in Utah said they were ""very concerned"" about the rise in new cases over the past week.The state has recorded more than 12,000 infections, according to Johns Hopkins.""When you're away from home, please avoid close contact with others, and wear a mask when other social distancing measures aren't feasible,"" the Utah Department of Health said on Twitter.

Suzanne Harrison called the spike of cases ""very concerning (and) approaching exponential.""""Today's 18.5% positive test rate is double yesterday's (9.4%),"" she tweeted over the weekend. ""Please be careful. Practice social distancing. Avoid crowds. Use masks where appropriate. Wash your hands.""Several universities have also reported new cases within their athletic programs — including Arkansas State, Auburn University and Oklahoma State University.An important drug could run out Meanwhile, as officials emphasize the U.S. is not yet out of the woods, a government official gave a stark warning. The U.S. government's current supply of remdesivir, the only drug known to work against coronavirus, will run out at the end of the month, Dr. Robert Kadlec, a U.S. Department of Health and Human Services official, told CNN.The government's last shipment of the drug will go out the week of June 29. Gilead Sciences, the company that makes the drug, is ramping up to make more, but it's unclear how much will be available this summer.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration gave emergency authorization for remdesivir last month. The drug, an intravenous antiviral medication studied to treat Ebola, is now used on hospitalized Covid patients. A study has shown it helps cut down the length of hospital stays.The government has been working to help Gilead ""with some of their supply chain challenges in terms of raw materials and being able to accelerate the process,"" Kadlec said.""Whatever the supply may be, there may not be enough for everyone who may need it,"" he said.",0.0

Cars and businesses were torched, the words “I can’t breathe” were spray-painted all over buildings, a fire in a trash bin burned near the gates of the White House, and tens of thousands marched peacefully through city streets to protest the death of George Floyd, a black man who died Monday after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee on his neck until he stopped breathing. His death is one of a litany of racial tragedies that have thrown the country into chaos amid the coronavirus pandemic that has left millions out of work and killed more than 100,000 people in the U.S., including disproportionate numbers of black people. “We’re sick of it. The cops are out of control,” protester Olga Hall said in Washington D.C. “They’re wild. There’s just been too many dead boys.” People set fire to police cars, threw bottles at police officers and busted windows of storefronts, carrying away TVs and other items even as some protesters urged them to stop. In Indianapolis, police were investigating multiple shootings, including one that left a person dead amid the protests — adding to deaths in Detroit and Minneapolis in recent days. In Minneapolis, the city where the protests began, police, state troopers and National Guard members moved in soon after an 8 p.m. curfew took effect to break up protests, firing tear gas and rubber bullets to clear streets outside a police precinct and elsewhere. At least 13 police officers were injured in Philadelphia when peaceful protests turned violent and at least four police vehicles were set on fire. In New York City, dangerous confrontations flared repeatedly as officers made arrests and cleared streets. A video showed two NYPD cruisers lurching into a crowd of demonstrators who were pushing a barricade against one of them and pelting it with objects. Several people were knocked to the ground, and it was unclear if anyone was hurt. “The mistakes that are happening are not mistakes. They’re repeated violent terrorist offenses and people need to stop killing black people,” Brooklyn protester Meryl Makielski said. Few corners of America were untouched, from protesters setting fires inside Reno’s city hall, to police launching tear gas at rock-throwing demonstrators in Fargo, North Dakota. In Salt Lake City, demonstrators flipped a police car and lit it on fire. Police said six people were arrested and a police officer was injured after being struck in the head with a baseball bat. In Ferguson, Missouri, where Michael Brown Jr. was shot and killed by a white police officer in 2014, sparking a wave of protests throughout the country, mostly peaceful protests turned late Saturday and six officers hit with rocks and fireworks were injured. Police have arrested at least 1,669 people in 22 cities since Thursday, according to a tally by The Associated Press. Nearly a third of those arrests came in Los Angeles, where the governor declared a state of emergency and ordered the National Guard to back up the city’s 10,000 police officers as dozens of fires burned across the city. The damage in U.S. cities came as many Americans plan to return to in-person church services on Sunday for the first time in several weeks since the pandemic forced a ban on large gatherings. Pastors in pulpits across the country will likely be urging peace amid the rubble of riots. Trump appeared to cheer on the tougher tactics Saturday night, commending the National Guard deployment in Minneapolis, declaring “No games!” and saying police in New York City “must be allowed to do their job!” Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden condemned the violence as he continued to express common cause with those demonstrating after Floyd’s death. “The act of protesting should never be allowed to overshadow the reason we protest,” Biden said in a statement Saturday night. Overnight curfews were imposed in more than a dozen major cities nationwide, including Atlanta, Denver, Los Angeles, Minneapolis, San Francisco and Seattle. This week’s unrest recalled the riots in Los Angeles nearly 30 years ago after the acquittal of the white police officers who beat Rodney King, a black motorist who had led them on a high-speed chase. The protests of Floyd’s killing have gripped many more cities, but the losses in Minneapolis have yet to approach the staggering totals Los Angeles saw during five days of rioting in 1992, when more than 60 people died, 2,000-plus were injured and thousands arrested, with property damage topping $1 billion. But not all protests were marred by violence. In Juneau, Alaska, local police joined protesters at a rally in front of a giant whale sculpture on the city’s waterfront. “We don’t tolerate excessive use of force,” Juneau Police Chief Ed Mercer told a gathering where most people wore masks and some sang Alaska Native songs. The show of force in Minneapolis came after three days when police largely avoided engaging protesters, and after the state poured in more than 4,000 National Guard troops to Minneapolis and said the number would soon rise to nearly 11,000. “The situation in Minneapolis is no longer in any way about the murder of George Floyd,” said Gov. Tim Walz, who also said local forces had been overmatched the previous day. “It is about attacking civil society, instilling fear and disrupting our great cities.” Some residents were glad to see the upheaval dissipating. “l live here. I haven’t been able to sleep,” said Iman Muhammad, whose neighborhood saw multiple fires set Friday night. Muhammad said she sympathized with peaceful protests over Floyd’s death but disagreed with the violence: “Wrong doesn’t answer wrong.” ___ Numerous AP journalists contributed from across the U.S.",0.0
1621564019,2020-05-31 10:14:33,Massive US protests raise fears of new virus outbreaks,https://www.krqe.com/news/massive-us-protests-raise-fears-of-new-virus-outbreaks/,en,True,,96605,krqe.com,http://www.krqe.com/#spider,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — The mayor of Atlanta, one of dozens of U.S. cities hit by massive protests in recent days, has a message for demonstrators: “If you were out protesting last night, you probably need to go get a COVID test this week.” As more beaches, churches, schools and businesses reopened worldwide, civil unrest in the United States over repeated racial injustice is raising fears of new coronavirus outbreaks in a country that has seen more infections and deaths than anywhere else in the world. Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms warned that “there is still a pandemic in America that’s killing black and brown people at higher numbers.” Violent protests over the death of George Floyd have shaken the country from New York City to Minneapolis, from Atlanta to Los Angeles. Some protests have turned into riots and clashes with police, leaving stores burned and torched cars in the streets. City officials have ordered overnight curfews to quell the violence. Floyd, a black man, died on May 25 in Minneapolis after a white police officer pressed a knee into his neck. It was the latest in a series of deaths of black men and women at the hands of police in America. Health experts fear that silent carriers of the virus who have no symptoms could unwittingly infect others at protests where people are packed cheek to jowl, many without masks. “Whether they’re fired up or not, that doesn’t prevent them from getting the virus,” said Bradley Pollock, chairman of the Department of Public Health Sciences at the University of California, Davis. The U.S. has seen over 1.7 million infections and nearly 104,000 deaths in the pandemic, which has disproportionately affected racial minorities in a nation that does not have universal health care. The Minnesota health commissioner warned that the protests are almost certain to fuel new infections. “We have two crises that are sandwiched on top of one other,” Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said. Even for the many protesters wearing masks, those don’t guarantee protection. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says cloth masks keep infected people from spreading the virus but are not designed to protect wearers from getting it. On Sunday, many Americans were returning to in-person church services for the first time in many weeks as some emergency measures are lifted and mosques reopened across the Middle East, but in countries from India to Colombia the number of new infection was still on the rise. In Europe, unions in Paris flouted a ban on large gatherings Saturday to protest the dire conditions facing workers in the country illegally. Police used tear gas to disperse the crowds and said they had banned the march due to health risks. Hong Kong police have used tear gas, pepper spray and rubber bullets to break up protests in recent weeks. A ban on gatherings of more than eight people has been extended to June 4, the day of an annual candlelight vigil to mark the Chinese military’s 1989 crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators in Beijing’s Tiananmen Square. More than 6 million infections have been reported worldwide, with nearly 370,000 deaths, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. The true death toll is believed to be significantly higher, with experts saying many victims died of the virus without ever being tested. The situation worsened Sunday in India, where new daily cases topped 8,000 for the first time and 193 more deaths were reported. India still is easing restrictions on shops and public transport in more states beginning Monday, although subways and schools will remain closed.

1621572653,2020-05-31 10:13:47,‘We’re sick of it’: Anger over police killings shatters US,https://www.krqe.com/news/national/were-sick-of-it-anger-over-police-killings-shatters-us/,en,True,,662160,KRQE,https://www.krqe.com/,"MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Another night of unrest in every corner of the country left charred and shattered landscapes in dozens of American cities Sunday as years of festering frustrations over the mistreatment of African Americans at the hands of police boiled over in expressions of rage met with tear gas and rubber bullets. Cars and businesses were torched, the words “I can’t breathe” were spray-painted all over buildings, a fire in a trash bin burned near the gates of the White House, and tens of thousands marched peacefully through city streets to protest the death of George Floyd, a black man who died Monday after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee on his neck until he stopped breathing. His death is one of a litany of racial tragedies that have thrown the country into chaos amid the coronavirus pandemic that has left millions out of work and killed more than 100,000 people in the U.S., including disproportionate numbers of black people. “We’re sick of it. The cops are out of control,” protester Olga Hall said in Washington D.C. “They’re wild. There’s just been too many dead boys.” People set fire to police cars, threw bottles at police officers and busted windows of storefronts, carrying away TVs and other items even as some protesters urged them to stop. In Indianapolis, police were investigating multiple shootings, including one that left a person dead amid the protests — adding to deaths in Detroit and Minneapolis in recent days. In Minneapolis, the city where the protests began, police, state troopers and National Guard members moved in soon after an 8 p.m. curfew took effect to break up protests, firing tear gas and rubber bullets to clear streets outside a police precinct and elsewhere. At least 13 police officers were injured in Philadelphia when peaceful protests turned violent and at least four police vehicles were set on fire. In New York City, dangerous confrontations flared repeatedly as officers made arrests and cleared streets. A video showed two NYPD cruisers lurching into a crowd of demonstrators who were pushing a barricade against one of them and pelting it with objects. Several people were knocked to the ground, and it was unclear if anyone was hurt. “The mistakes that are happening are not mistakes. They’re repeated violent terrorist offenses and people need to stop killing black people,” Brooklyn protester Meryl Makielski said. Few corners of America were untouched, from protesters setting fires inside Reno’s city hall, to police launching tear gas at rock-throwing demonstrators in Fargo, North Dakota. In Salt Lake City, demonstrators flipped a police car and lit it on fire. Police said six people were arrested and a police officer was injured after being struck in the head with a baseball bat. In Ferguson, Missouri, where Michael Brown Jr. was shot and killed by a white police officer in 2014, sparking a wave of protests throughout the country, mostly peaceful protests turned late Saturday and six officers hit with rocks and fireworks were injured. Police have arrested at least 1,669 people in 22 cities since Thursday, according to a tally by The Associated Press. Nearly a third of those arrests came in Los Angeles, where the governor declared a state of emergency and ordered the National Guard to back up the city’s 10,000 police officers as dozens of fires burned across the city. The damage in U.S. cities came as many Americans plan to return to in-person church services on Sunday for the first time in several weeks since the pandemic forced a ban on large gatherings. Pastors in pulpits across the country will likely be urging peace amid the rubble of riots. Trump appeared to cheer on the tougher tactics Saturday night, commending the National Guard deployment in Minneapolis, declaring “No games!” and saying police in New York City “must be allowed to do their job!” Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden condemned the violence as he continued to express common cause with those demonstrating after Floyd’s death. “The act of protesting should never be allowed to overshadow the reason we protest,” Biden said in a statement Saturday night. Overnight curfews were imposed in more than a dozen major cities nationwide, including Atlanta, Denver, Los Angeles, Minneapolis, San Francisco and Seattle. This week’s unrest recalled the riots in Los Angeles nearly 30 years ago after the acquittal of the white police officers who beat Rodney King, a black motorist who had led them on a high-speed chase. The protests of Floyd’s killing have gripped many more cities, but the losses in Minneapolis have yet to approach the staggering totals Los Angeles saw during five days of rioting in 1992, when more than 60 people died, 2,000-plus were injured and thousands arrested, with property damage topping $1 billion. But not all protests were marred by violence. In Juneau, Alaska, local police joined protesters at a rally in front of a giant whale sculpture on the city’s waterfront. “We don’t tolerate excessive use of force,” Juneau Police Chief Ed Mercer told a gathering where most people wore masks and some sang Alaska Native songs. The show of force in Minneapolis came after three days when police largely avoided engaging protesters, and after the state poured in more than 4,000 National Guard troops to Minneapolis and said the number would soon rise to nearly 11,000. “The situation in Minneapolis is no longer in any way about the murder of George Floyd,” said Gov. Tim Walz, who also said local forces had been overmatched the previous day. “It is about attacking civil society, instilling fear and disrupting our great cities.” Some residents were glad to see the upheaval dissipating. “l live here. I haven’t been able to sleep,” said Iman Muhammad, whose neighborhood saw multiple fires set Friday night. Muhammad said she sympathized with peaceful protests over Floyd’s death but disagreed with the violence: “Wrong doesn’t answer wrong.” ___ Numerous AP journalists contributed from across the U.S.",0.0
1621572647,2020-05-31 10:14:33,Massive US protests raise fears of new virus outbreaks,https://www.krqe.com/news/massive-us-protests-raise-fears-of-new-virus-outbreaks/,en,True,,662160,KRQE,https://www.krqe.com/,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — The mayor of Atlanta, one of dozens of U.S. cities hit by massive protests in recent days, has a message for demonstrators: “If you were out protesting last night, you probably need to go get a COVID test this week.” As more beaches, churches, schools and businesses reopened worldwide, civil unrest in the United States over repeated racial injustice is raising fears of new coronavirus outbreaks in a country that has seen more infections and deaths than anywhere else in the world. Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms warned that “there is still a pandemic in America that’s killing black and brown people at higher numbers.” Violent protests over the death of George Floyd have shaken the country from New York City to Minneapolis, from Atlanta to Los Angeles. Some protests have turned into riots and clashes with police, leaving stores burned and torched cars in the streets. City officials have ordered overnight curfews to quell the violence. Floyd, a black man, died on May 25 in Minneapolis after a white police officer pressed a knee into his neck. It was the latest in a series of deaths of black men and women at the hands of police in America. Health experts fear that silent carriers of the virus who have no symptoms could unwittingly infect others at protests where people are packed cheek to jowl, many without masks. “Whether they’re fired up or not, that doesn’t prevent them from getting the virus,” said Bradley Pollock, chairman of the Department of Public Health Sciences at the University of California, Davis. The U.S. has seen over 1.7 million infections and nearly 104,000 deaths in the pandemic, which has disproportionately affected racial minorities in a nation that does not have universal health care. The Minnesota health commissioner warned that the protests are almost certain to fuel new infections. “We have two crises that are sandwiched on top of one other,” Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said. Even for the many protesters wearing masks, those don’t guarantee protection. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says cloth masks keep infected people from spreading the virus but are not designed to protect wearers from getting it. On Sunday, many Americans were returning to in-person church services for the first time in many weeks as some emergency measures are lifted and mosques reopened across the Middle East, but in countries from India to Colombia the number of new infection was still on the rise. In Europe, unions in Paris flouted a ban on large gatherings Saturday to protest the dire conditions facing workers in the country illegally. Police used tear gas to disperse the crowds and said they had banned the march due to health risks. Hong Kong police have used tear gas, pepper spray and rubber bullets to break up protests in recent weeks. A ban on gatherings of more than eight people has been extended to June 4, the day of an annual candlelight vigil to mark the Chinese military’s 1989 crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators in Beijing’s Tiananmen Square. More than 6 million infections have been reported worldwide, with nearly 370,000 deaths, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. The true death toll is believed to be significantly higher, with experts saying many victims died of the virus without ever being tested. The situation worsened Sunday in India, where new daily cases topped 8,000 for the first time and 193 more deaths were reported. India still is easing restrictions on shops and public transport in more states beginning Monday, although subways and schools will remain closed. In Saudi Arabia, tens of thousands of mosques reopened Sunday for the first time in more than two months, but Islam’s holiest site in Mecca remained closed. In Jerusalem, throngs of worshippers waited outside the Al-Aqsa Mosque before it reopened. Many wore surgical masks and waited for temperature checks as they entered.

A live shot he was doing was interrupted by a group of protesters who shouted obscenities directed at Fox.

Vittert said there were no markings on him or the crew’s equipment to identify them as from Fox. But he said during the demonstration, one man continually asked him who he worked for. He didn’t answer, but the man found a picture of Vittert on his cell phone and shouted to other protesters that he was from Fox. “The protesters stopped protesting whatever it was they were protesting and turned on us,” he said, “and that was a very different feeling.” He compared it to when he was chased away from a demonstration in Egypt during the Arab Spring of 2011 by a group that shouted, “Fox News hates Muslims.” A correspondent from the website The Daily Caller followed Vittert and the demonstrators as they left the park. At one point, someone took Vittert’s microphone and threw it at his back. One woman chasing him wore a t-shirt that said, “I can’t breathe,” a reference what Floyd said earlier this week when a Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee against his neck.

While police tried to keep them away from the CNN Center, demonstrators broke windows there and scrawled obscene graffiti on the network’s logo. Ian Smith, a photographer for KDKA-TV in Pittsburgh, said that he was attacked by protesters who stomped and kicked him at a demonstration there. Smith, who said other protesters jumped in to save him, posted a picture on Twitter showing him with a bruised face and bloody hand. In Louisville, WAVE-TV was on the air covering a demonstration when video showed a police officer aiming a rifle at reporter Kaitlin Rust and her crew. She was heard yelling, “I’ve been shot!

(WPRI) — Thousands attended a mainly peaceful protest in Providence Saturday afternoon, calling for justice for George Floyd, a black man killed by police in Minnesota on Monday. The rally, organized by Black Lives Matter Rhode Island, started at Burnside Park in Kennedy Plaza and moved to the steps of the State House where “No Justice, No Peace” was later spray-painted in black on the white marble. “Everyone is fed up,” said Paula Quigley, who attended the rally. “Not just black people. These are human beings.” Nationwide outrage has been fueled by a viral video showing former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin pinning Floyd down with his knee at Floyd’s neck until Floyd was unconscious. Floyd later died. Chauvin has since been arrested and charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Three other officers in the video have not been charged. “It’s got to stop,” said Brother Gary Danztler, one of the organizers of Saturday’s event in Providence. “I’m sick to my stomach. We step back into time, we aren’t moving forward now.” In some places, protests have turned violent. In Boston, 10 people were arrested following a clash with police Friday night.

(WPRI) — Thousands attended a mainly peaceful protest in Providence Saturday afternoon, calling for justice for George Floyd, a black man killed by police in Minnesota on Monday. The rally, organized by Black Lives Matter Rhode Island, started at Burnside Park in Kennedy Plaza and moved to the steps of the State House where “No Justice, No Peace” was later spray-painted in black on the white marble. “Everyone is fed up,” said Paula Quigley, who attended the rally. “Not just black people. These are human beings.” Nationwide outrage has been fueled by a viral video showing former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin pinning Floyd down with his knee at Floyd’s neck until Floyd was unconscious. Floyd later died. Chauvin has since been arrested and charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Three other officers in the video have not been charged. “It’s got to stop,” said Brother Gary Danztler, one of the organizers of Saturday’s event in Providence. “I’m sick to my stomach. We step back into time, we aren’t moving forward now.” In some places, protests have turned violent. In Boston, 10 people were arrested following a clash with police Friday night.

1621604035,2020-05-31 11:21:25,"Protests heat up across US, governors call in National Guard",https://www.krqe.com/news/national/protests-heat-up-across-us-governors-call-in-national-guard/,en,True,,662160,KRQE,https://www.krqe.com/,"MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Governors in several states called in National Guard troops as protests over repeated police killings of black men grew Saturday from New York to Cleveland (video above) to Tulsa to Los Angeles, where police fired rubber bullets to scatter crowds and at least one police car burned. The protests, which began in Minneapolis following Monday’s death of George Floyd after a police officer pressed his knee on Floyd’s neck for more than eight minutes, have left parts of that city a grid of broken windows, burned-out buildings and ransacked stores. But the demonstrations have since become a national phenomenon, as protesters decry years of deaths at police hands. In Tulsa, Oklahoma’s Greenwood District, the site of a 1921 massacre of black people that left as many as 300 dead and the city’s thriving black district in ruins, protesters blocked intersections and chanted the name of Terence Crutcher, a black man killed by a police officer in 2016. Other peaceful protests were being held in California, Delaware, Florida, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and South Carolina. In Tulsa and Wilmington, Delaware, protesters made their way onto nearby interstates and shut them down temporarily. In Tallahassee, Florida, a pickup truck drove through a crowd of protesters, sending some running and screaming as the vehicle stopped and started and at one point had a person on its hood, police said, but no serious injuries were reported. In Columbia, South Carolina, a television reporter for WIS-TV was injured by rocks thrown Saturday amid protests outside the Columbia Police Department. Several hundred people participated in the demonstration, tearing down the American and state flags in front of the police department’s headquarters. They also swarmed a Columbia police car, breaking its windows, The State reported. In Los Angeles protesters chanted “Black Lives Matter,” some within inches of the face shields of officers. Police used batons to move protesters back and shot rubber bullets to scatter the crowd. One man used a skateboard to attempt to break the windshield of a police SUV. A spray painted police car burned in the streets. In Minneapolis, 29-year-old Sam Allkija, said at Saturday’s protest that the destruction that has accompanied protests is a sign of the frustration and rage the black community has felt for a long time. “I don’t condone them,” he said. “But you have to look deeper into why these riots are happening.” Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz fully mobilized the state’s National Guard and promised a massive show of force to help quell unrest that has grown increasingly destructive. “The situation in Minneapolis is no longer in any way about the murder of George Floyd,” Walz said. “It is about attacking civil society, instilling fear and disrupting our great cities.” After a tumultuous Friday night, racially diverse crowds took to the streets again for mostly peaceful protests in dozens of cities. The previous day’s protests, too, had started calmly — in cities from New York to Oakland, California, from Atlanta to Portland, Oregon — before many descended into violence. The massive crowds involved, with many people not wearing masks or practicing social distancing, raised concerns among health experts about the potential for the spread of the coronavirus. Hundreds of people were arrested Friday, and police used batons, rubber bullets and pepper spray to push back crowds in some cities. Many departments reported officers were injured, while social media was awash in images of police using forceful tactics, throwing protesters to the ground, using bicycles as shields, and trampling a protester while on horseback. This week’s unrest recalled the riots in Los Angeles nearly 30 years ago after the acquittal of the white police officers who beat Rodney King, a black motorist who had led them on a high-speed chase. The protests of Floyd’s killing have gripped many more cities, but the losses in Minneapolis have yet to approach the staggering totals in Los Angeles. During the five days of rioting in 1992, more than 60 died, 2,000-plus were injured and thousands arrested, with property damage topping $1 billion. Many protesters spoke of frustration that Floyd’s death was one more in a litany. It comes in the wake of the killing in Georgia of Ahmaud Arbery, who was shot after being pursued by two white men while running in their neighborhood, and in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic that has thrown millions out of work, killed more than 100,000 people in the U.S. and disproportionately affected black people. On Friday, the officer who held his knee to Floyd’s neck was arrested and charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter — but that appeared to provide little balm. Many protesters are demanding the arrests of the three other officers involved. Comments from President Donald Trump stoked the anger, when he fired off a series of tweets criticizing Minnesota’s response, ridiculing people who protested outside the White House and warning that if protesters breached the fence, “they would … have been greeted with the most vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons, I have ever seen.” Leaders in many affected cities have voiced outrage over Floyd’s killing and offered sympathy for those who were protesting — but as unrest intensified, many spoke of the desperate need to protect their cities and said they would call in reinforcements, despite concerns that could lead to more heavy handed tactics. The unrest prompted responses across the globe. A top Vatican cardinal, Peter Turkson who is from Ghana, urged pastors in the United States to plead for calm, while U.S. national soccer player Weston McKennie wore an armband referencing Floyd’s death while playing for Schalke in Germany’s Bundesliga. Minnesota has steadily increased the number of National Guardsmen it says it needs to contain the unrest, and has now called up 1,700. The governor is also considering a potential offer of military police, which the Pentagon put on alert. Governors in Georgia, Kentucky, Ohio and Texas activated the National Guard after protests there turned violent overnight, while nighttime curfews were put in place in Portland, Oregon, and Cincinnati. A person was killed in downtown Detroit just before midnight after someone fired shots into an SUV near the Greektown entertainment district, police said. Police had initially said someone fired into the crowd from an SUV. And police in St. Louis were investigating the death of a protester who had climbed between two trailers of a Fed Ex truck and was killed when it drove away. Atlanta saw some of the most extreme unrest. While crews in that city worked to clean up glass and debris from rioting the night before, a large electronic billboard on Saturday morning still carried the message, “If you love Atlanta PLEASE GO HOME,” echoing the mayor’s pleas. National Guard members blocked anyone from approaching heavily damaged buildings, including the College Football Hall of Fame and nearby restaurants. Video posted to social media showed New York City officers using batons and shoving protesters down as they took people into custody and cleared streets. One video showed on officer slam a woman to the ground as he walked past her in the street. Underscoring that Floyd’s killing is part of a pattern, the names of black people killed by police, including Eric Garner, who died on Staten Island in 2014, were on signs and in chants. “Our country has a sickness. We have to be out here,” said Brianna Petrisko, among those at lower Manhattan’s Foley Square, where most were wearing masks amid the coronavirus pandemic. “This is the only way we’re going to be heard.”",0.0

The president has said that members of the loosely defined far-left group Antifa — short for ""anti-fascists"" — have led clashes with police and looting in cities across the U.S. since the killing of a black man in police custody in Minneapolis.

U.S. law allows terrorist designations for foreign groups since belonging to those groups doesn't enjoy the same protections. Antifa, short for anti-fascists, describes a broad group of people whose positions can be hard to define, but many members support oppressed populations and protest the amassing of wealth by corporations and elites. Some employ radical or militant tactics to get their message across. Typically, groups who identify as Antifa are amorphous and don't have a central leadership, though some local activists are highly organized, according to federal law enforcement officials. That has made it difficult for U.S. law enforcement to deal with violence from members of groups that label themselves as Antifa. Federal law enforcement officials told CNN they are aware of outside groups who are behind some of the property destruction and violence, using the cover of the legitimate protests in Minneapolis and elsewhere. Those domestic extremist groups include anarchists, white supremacists and far-left extremists, some of whom have overlapping affiliations.An announcement by the Justice Department on Sunday to use Joint Terrorism Task Forces around the country to investigate some of the violence in major cities singles out leftist Antifa activity, though U.S. law enforcement officials say there are groups from both the extremist left and right involved in the riots and attacks on police. In response to the president's tweet, ACLU National Security Project Director Hina Shamsi said there is ""no legal authority for designating a domestic group"" as a terrorist organization.""As this tweet demonstrates, terrorism is an inherently political label, easily abused and misused. There is no legal authority for designating a domestic group. Any such designation would raise significant due process and First Amendment concerns.""The Justice Department has studied the issue of creating a domestic terrorism law to apply to people involved in violence and who belong to domestic extremist groups, but the constitutional issues have been a hurdle to that effort.",0.0

Advertisement What is Antifa? Share Shares Copy Link Copy As protests over George Floyd's death spread across the country, officials have blamed the violent nature of some demonstrations on members of a controversial group known as Antifa.President Donald Trump on Sunday said the United States would designate Antifa a terrorist organization, though the federal government has no legal authority to label a wholly domestic group the way it designates foreign terrorist organizations.Speaking at the Kennedy Space Center on Saturday, Trump said the recent ""violence and vandalism"" seen across the country ""is being led by Antifa and other radical left-wing groups who are terrorizing the innocent, destroying jobs, hurting businesses and burning down buildings.""The president did not provide any evidence for his assertion.National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien echoed Trump's comments on CNN's ""State of the Union"" Sunday morning, telling Jake Tapper that the violence ""is being driven by Antifa.""CNN has not independently verified whether the group is involved in recent protests.Here's a closer look at Antifa protesters, who have become more visible in the last several years.What is Antifa?Antifa is short for anti-fascists. The term is used to define a broad group of people whose political beliefs lean toward the left — often the far left — but do not conform with the Democratic Party platform. The group doesn't have an official leader or headquarters, although groups in certain states hold regular meetings.Antifa positions can be hard to define, but many members support oppressed populations and protest the amassing of wealth by corporations and elites. Some employ radical or militant tactics to get their message across.Scott Crow, a former Antifa organizer, says the ""radical ideals"" promoted by Antifas are starting to be adopted by liberals. ""They would never have looked at (those ideals) before, because they saw us as the enemy as much as the right-wingers.""The majority of Antifa members don't fall into a stereotype. Since the election of President Trump, however, most new Antifa members are young voters.How did the group start?The exact origins of the group are unknown, but Antifa can be traced to Nazi Germany and Anti-Fascist Action, a militant group founded in the 1980s in the United Kingdom.Modern-day Antifa members have become more active in making themselves known at public rallies and within the progressive movement, says Brian Levin, director of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino.""What they're trying to do now is not only become prominent through violence at these high-profile rallies, but also to reach out through small meetings and through social networking to cultivate disenfranchised progressives who heretofore were peaceful,"" Levin said.Where do they protest?Members have been spotted at high-profile, right-wing events across the country.In August 2017 members of the group showed up in Charlottesville, Virginia, to condemn racism and counter protest hundreds of white nationalists opposed to the removal of a Gen. Robert E. Lee statue. The protests turned violent when James Fields, who is not a member of Antifa, plowed his car through a crowd of counter protesters, killing Heather Heyer.Video above: President Trump Says There Were 'Bad Dudes on the Other Side' in CharlottesvilleEarlier that year, Antifa protested the appearance of Milo Yiannopoulos, an alt-right provocateur, at the University of California, Berkeley. They also protested President Trump's inauguration in 2017.While it can be difficult to distinguish Antifa activists from other protesters, some dress head to toe in black. Members call this the ""Black Bloc.""They also wear masks to hide their identities from the police and whomever they are protesting.Why are they controversial?The group is known for causing damage to property during protests. In Berkeley, black-clad protesters wearing masks threw Molotov cocktails and smashed windows at the student union center where the Yiannopoulos event was to be held.Crow, who was involved with Antifa for almost 30 years, said members use violence as a means of self-defense and they believe property destruction does not equate to violence.""There is a place for violence. Is that the world that we want to live in? No. Is it the world we want to inhabit? No. Is it the world we want to create? No. But will we push back? Yes,"" Crow said.Levin said Antifa activists feel the need to partake in violence because ""they believe that elites are controlling the government and the media. So they need to make a statement head-on against the people who they regard as racist.""""There's this 'It's going down' mentality and this 'Hit them with your boots' mentality that goes back many decades to confrontations that took place, not only here in the American South, but also in places like Europe,"" he added.White nationalists and other members of the so-called alt-right have denounced members of Antifa, sometimes calling them the ""alt-left."" Many white nationalists from the Charlottesville rallies claimed it was the Antifa groups that led the protests to turn violent.Peter Cvjetanovic, a white nationalist who attended the Virginia protests, said he believes the far left, including Antifa, are ""just as dangerous, if not more dangerous than the right wing could ever be.""""These are people who preach tolerance and love while at the same time threatening people with a different political ideology. We go to our rallies and they harass us and attack us but they held theirs and we ignore them. You don't see right-wing protests get like this,"" Cvjetanovic told KRNV.But Crow said the philosophy of Antifa is based on the idea of direct action. ""The idea in Antifa is that we go where they (right-wingers) go. That hate speech is not free speech. That if you are endangering people with what you say and the actions that are behind them, then you do not have the right to do that.""And so we go to cause conflict, to shut them down where they are, because we don't believe that Nazis or fascists of any stripe should have a mouthpiece.""",0.0

Thousands gathered in central London on Sunday to offer support for American demonstrators. Chanting “No justice! No peace!” and waving placards with the words “How many more?” at Trafalgar Square, the protesters ignored U.K. government rules banning crowds because of the pandemic. Police didn’t stop them. Demonstrators then marched to the U.S. Embassy, where a long line of officers surrounded the building. Several hundred milled around in the street and waved placards. Protesters in Denmark also converged on the U.S. Embassy on Sunday. Participants carried placards with messages such as “Stop Killing Black People.” The U.S. Embassy in Berlin was the scene of protests on Saturday under the motto: “Justice for George Floyd.” Several hundred more people took to the streets Sunday in the capital’s Kreuzberg area, carrying signs with slogans like “Silence is Violence,” “Hold Cops Accountable,” and “Who Do You Call When Police Murder?” No incidents were reported. Germany’s top-selling Bild newspaper on Sunday carried the sensational headline “This killer-cop set America ablaze” with an arrow pointing to a photo of now-fired police officer Derek Chauvin, who has been charged with third-degree murder in Floyd’s death, with his knee on Floyd’s neck. The newspaper’s story reported “scenes like out of a civil war.” In Italy, the Corriere della Sera newspaper’s senior U.S. correspondent Massimo Gaggi wrote that the reaction to Floyd’s killing was “different” than previous cases of black Americans killed by police and the ensuring violence. “There are exasperated black movements that no longer preach nonviolent resistance,” Gaggi wrote, noting the Minnesota governor’s warning that “anarchist and white supremacy groups are trying to fuel the chaos.” In countries with authoritarian governments, state-controlled media have been highlighting the chaos and violence of the U.S. demonstrations, in part to undermine American officials’ criticism of their own nations. ADVERTISEMENTSkip ................................................................ In China, the protests are being viewed through the prism of U.S. government criticism of China’s crackdown on anti-government protests in Hong Kong. Hu Xijin, the editor of the state-owned Global Times newspaper, tweeted that U.S. officials can now see protests out their own windows: “I want to ask Speaker Pelosi and Secretary Pompeo: Should Beijing support protests in the U.S., like you glorified rioters in Hong Kong?” Hua Chunying, a Chinese Foreign ministry spokeswoman, pointed out America’s racial unrest by tweeting “I can’t breathe,” which Floyd said before his death. In Iran, which has violently put down nationwide demonstrations by killing hundreds, arresting thousands and disrupting internet access to the outside world, state television has repeatedly aired images of the U.S. unrest. One TV anchor discussed “a horrible scene from New York, where police attacked protesters.” Another state TV message accused U.S. police agencies in Washington of “setting fire to cars and attacking protesters,” without offering any evidence. Russia accused the United States of “systemic problems in the human rights sphere.” It denounced Floyd’s death as the latest in a series of police violence cases against African Americans. “This incident is far from the first in a series of lawless conduct and unjustified violence from U.S. law enforcement,” the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement. “American police commit such high-profile crimes all too often.” There also have been expressions of solidarity with the demonstrators. In Brazil, hundreds of people gathered in front of the Rio de Janeiro state government palace to protest crimes committed by the police against black people in Rio’s working-class neighborhoods, known as favelas. ADVERTISEMENTSkip ................................................................ The protest, called “Black lives matter,” was interrupted when police used tear gas to disperse people. “I can’t breathe”, said some of the demonstrators, alluding to the George Floyd´s death. Protesters called for an end to police operations inside favelas. In Canada, an anti-racism protest degenerated into clashes between Montreal police and some demonstrators. About three hours after a march that snaked its way through downtown Montreal had ended, police declared the gathering illegal after they say projectiles were thrown at officers who responded with pepper spray and tear gas. Some windows were smashed and some fires were set. Over the weekend, Lebanese anti-government protesters flooded social media with tweets sympathetic to U.S. protesters, using the hashtag #Americarevolts. That’s a play on the slogan for Lebanon’s protest movement — Lebanon revolts — which erupted on Oct. 17 last year. Within 24 hours, the hashtag #Americanrevolts became the No. 1 trending tag in Lebanon. In another expression of solidarity with American protesters, about 150 people marched through central Jerusalem on Saturday to protest the shooting death by Israeli police of an unarmed, autistic Palestinian man earlier in the day. Israeli police mistakenly suspected that the man, Iyad Halak, was carrying a weapon. When he failed to obey orders to stop, officers opened fire. ___ Associated Press Writers David Rising in Berlin, Jon Gambrell in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, Frances D’Emilio in Rome, Zeina Karam in Beirut, Tia Goldenberg in Jerusalem, Ken Moritsugu in Beijing, Jari Tanner in Helsinki, Finland, and Jim Heintz in Moscow, contributed to this report. ___ Follow the AP’s latest news about the protests in the U.S. at https://apnews.com/GeorgeFloyd",0.0

(Nexstar Photo/Wes Rapaport) AUSTIN — Following a string of violent protests across the state, Governor Greg Abbott declared a state of disaster for Texas on Sunday. According to a release, the state of disaster was activated because the violent protests endanger public safety and threaten property loss damage. Under this declaration, Governor Abbott has the ability to designate federal agents to serve as Texas Peace Officers. “Every Texan and every American has the right to protest and I encourage all Texans to exercise their First Amendment rights,” said Governor Abbott in the release. “However, violence against others and the destruction of property is unacceptable and counterproductive. As protests have turned violent in various areas across the state, it is crucial that we maintain order, uphold public safety, and protect against property damage or loss.” Across the nation, protests are taking place in response to the death of George Floyd from Monday’s incident in Minneapolis. In Texas, protesters have called for an end to police brutality and are seeking justice in Floyd’s case. The protests have turned violent in times. In Austin, businesses were looted and vandalized as protesters set fires to buildings, cars, and other parts of the city. In Dallas and Houston, police sprayed tear gas and shot rubber bullets after protesters blocked highways. In El Paso, police headquarters were vandalized in the wake of the movement. Additional protests were staged in areas such as Amarillo and Edinburg but were completed in a peaceful manner. On Saturday, Governor Abbott activated the National Guard to assist with policing the protests. The Sunday disaster declaration is another step the governor is taking to police these demonstrations.",0.0

During Detroit’s protest Saturday, a group of demonstrators walked onto a downtown-area freeway in an attempt to take it over, but that stretch of road had already been shut down to traffic, police chief James Craig told reporters.  The group of 200 to 250 people then headed into downtown and toward police headquarters, he said.  “We could tell they were getting somewhat agitated,” Craig said. “We didn’t want them to come close to our building. That’s when the protesters became violent.”  Rocks, other items, and fireworks were thrown at officers, who responded with tear gas to disperse the crowd, he said.

As long as everybody understands what they are doing, that they are FAKE NEWS and truly bad people with a sick agenda, we can easily work through them to GREATNESS! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 31, 2020 UPDATE (11:49 a.m.): Hundreds are protesting police brutality and racial violence at Michigan’s state Capitol.  Many were chanting, “I can’t breathe,” which was heard in the video of George Floyd — a black man who died after being pinned under the knee of a white Minneapolis police officer. ORIGINAL STORY (11:23 a.m.): The ‘Rally Against Police Brutality’ began just around 11:00 a.m. today at the Capitol lawn in Lansing today.  “It’s shocking,” said Ingham County Sheriff Scott Wriggelsworth when asked about his reaction to the incident with George Floyd in Minneapolis. “That can never be tolerated.” Around the country, peaceful protests involving tens of thousands of people on Saturday gave way, in some places, to rioting, looting, and violence.  In those instances, police vehicles were torched, stores emptied, and objects hurled at officers. The police response varied from restrained to aggressive, with officers at times firing tear gas and rubber bullets.  Police and peaceful protesters alike pleaded for a stop to violence, saying it only hindered calls for justice and reform.  “It only hurts the cause,” said Danielle Outlaw, head of the police force in Philadelphia, where more than 200 people were arrested as fires and looting engulfed Center City.  Disgust over generations of racism in a country founded by slaveholders combined with a string of recent high-profile killings to stoke the anger. Three months before Floyd’s death, Ahmaud Arbery was fatally shot as he jogged through a Georgia neighborhood. A white father and son are charged in the slaying. The month after Arbery was killed, an EMT named Breonna Taylor was shot eight times by Louisville, Kentucky, narcotics detectives who knocked down her front door. No drugs were found in her home.  Adding to that was angst from months of lockdowns brought on by the coronavirus pandemic, which has disproportionately hurt communities of color, not only in terms of infections but in job losses and economic stress.  “People in communities of color across the nation and right here in Michigan are feeling a sense of exhaustion and desperation. We stand in solidarity with those who are seeking equitable justice for everyone in our state,” tweeted Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer on Saturday, May 30th along with releasing a statement to encourage communities to designate areas for peaceful demonstrations.

During Detroit’s protest Saturday, a group of demonstrators walked onto a downtown-area freeway in an attempt to take it over, but that stretch of road had already been shut down to traffic, police chief James Craig told reporters.  The group of 200 to 250 people then headed into downtown and toward police headquarters, he said.  “We could tell they were getting somewhat agitated,” Craig said. “We didn’t want them to come close to our building. That’s when the protesters became violent.”  Rocks, other items, and fireworks were thrown at officers, who responded with tear gas to disperse the crowd, he said. UPDATE (1:58 p.m.): A man was arrested for spray painting on the steps of the Capitol, according to Devin Anderson-Torrez of The State News.  As of this time, this is an unconfirmed arrest that would be the only arrest so far at the largely peaceful protest today. Photos from the scene show the man spray-painted an expletive on the steps of the building. UPDATE (12:03 p.m.): President Donald Trump congratulated the National Guard this afternoon and lashed out at the mayor of Minneapolis yesterday evening following the response to protests in Minneapolis. The National Guard has been released in Minneapolis to do the job that the Democrat Mayor couldn’t do. Should have been used 2 days ago & there would not have been damage & Police Headquarters would not have been taken over & ruined. Great job by the National Guard. No games! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 31, 2020 Congratulations to our National Guard for the great job they did immediately upon arriving in Minneapolis, Minnesota, last night. The ANTIFA led anarchists, among others, were shut down quickly. Should have been done by Mayor on first night and there would have been no trouble! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 31, 2020 The President also said in a tweet that the “United States of America will be designating ANTIFA as a Terrorist Organization.” The United States of America will be designating ANTIFA as a Terrorist Organization. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 31, 2020 At 12:36 p.m. the president also tweeted against the media coverage as “truly bad people with a sick agenda” The Lamestream Media is doing everything within their power to foment hatred and anarchy. As long as everybody understands what they are doing, that they are FAKE NEWS and truly bad people with a sick agenda, we can easily work through them to GREATNESS! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 31, 2020 UPDATE (11:49 a.m.): Hundreds are protesting police brutality and racial violence at Michigan’s state Capitol.  Many were chanting, “I can’t breathe,” which was heard in the video of George Floyd — a black man who died after being pinned under the knee of a white Minneapolis police officer. ORIGINAL STORY (11:23 a.m.): The ‘Rally Against Police Brutality’ began just around 11:00 a.m. today at the Capitol lawn in Lansing today.  “It’s shocking,” said Ingham County Sheriff Scott Wriggelsworth when asked about his reaction to the incident with George Floyd in Minneapolis. “That can never be tolerated.” Around the country, peaceful protests involving tens of thousands of people on Saturday gave way, in some places, to rioting, looting, and violence.  In those instances, police vehicles were torched, stores emptied, and objects hurled at officers. The police response varied from restrained to aggressive, with officers at times firing tear gas and rubber bullets.  Police and peaceful protesters alike pleaded for a stop to violence, saying it only hindered calls for justice and reform.  “It only hurts the cause,” said Danielle Outlaw, head of the police force in Philadelphia, where more than 200 people were arrested as fires and looting engulfed Center City.  Disgust over generations of racism in a country founded by slaveholders combined with a string of recent high-profile killings to stoke the anger. Three months before Floyd’s death, Ahmaud Arbery was fatally shot as he jogged through a Georgia neighborhood. A white father and son are charged in the slaying. The month after Arbery was killed, an EMT named Breonna Taylor was shot eight times by Louisville, Kentucky, narcotics detectives who knocked down her front door. No drugs were found in her home.  Adding to that was angst from months of lockdowns brought on by the coronavirus pandemic, which has disproportionately hurt communities of color, not only in terms of infections but in job losses and economic stress.  “People in communities of color across the nation and right here in Michigan are feeling a sense of exhaustion and desperation. We stand in solidarity with those who are seeking equitable justice for everyone in our state,” tweeted Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer on Saturday, May 30th along with releasing a statement to encourage communities to designate areas for peaceful demonstrations.

1621834658,2020-05-31 20:21:58,Sunday night vigil held to honor George Floyd,https://www.krqe.com/news/albuquerque-metro/sunday-night-vigil-held-to-honor-george-floyd/,en,False,,96605,krqe.com,http://www.krqe.com/#spider,"ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (KRQE) – A loud and crowded, but so far peaceful protest in downtown Albuquerque took place on Sunday in response to the death of George Floyd. The protest started near Central and University around 7:00 Sunday evening with thousands of protesters marching throughout the city wanting to bring justice for Floyd. “Honestly, it’s just about reform. We just want peace, no violence. The couple of chants you hear cursing and stating violence they’re not with us,” said protester Frankie Grady. Grady was one of the thousands of people who took part in the protest. As far as KRQE News 13 crews saw, the protest was peaceful, as people chanted “George Floyd,” and “black lives matter” from University and Central all the way down to 8th Street. Hundreds of people held signs while cars honked and people yelled chants as they marched down Central to UNM. KRQE News 13 crews caught a dumpster fire off Lead and Harvard, but police could not confirm if it was directly related to the protest. The protest followed a candlelight vigil for Floyd where hundreds of people paid their respects and listened to dozens of speakers share their thoughts on Floyd’s death. The social services organization Albuquerque Center for Peace and Justice organized the event hoping to make a difference. “This is not just another demonstration. It’s not just another vigil. It’s a call to commitment to make some things happen. We want to put an end to institutional racism,” said Jim Harvey of Albuquerque. Mayor Keller also made an appearance at the vigil. During his speech, a couple of people chanted “defund the police.” As far as KRQE News 13 saw Sunday evening, there were no confrontations with police. They maintained a block away distance from the protesters at all times. Organizers of the vigil wanted to make it clear they were not associated to the protest.

According to Metro Police, 11 officers were injured in Saturday’s violent protest. Injuries range from cuts to broken bones, but no officers were hospitalized.

For a few hours, protest remained peaceful, but then crowds grew to about 1,500-2,000 people, Metro Police estimate. The demonstration devolved into protesters vandalizing cars, breaking store windows and looting an EZ Pawn shop on Las Vegas Boulevard. Police say one protesters hurled a cinder block at one officer and injured him. Other officers, police say, were pelted with rocks. About 300 Metro officers were deployed to areas throughout downtown. Protests first began at the Container Park on Fremont and 7 Streets, and stretched through the downtown area from the Clark County Detention Center to the Federal Courthouse. When officers ordered the crowd to disperse, protesters “defied lawful orders,” according to LVMPD. After officers issued several warnings to protesters, police then deployed canisters of tear gas around midnight. Some protesters, Metro says, then went on to tag buildings and destroy surrounding property. One patrol car was burned and two others were damaged. City and county buildings were also targeted.

Police custody. The rage out there is predictable. It's understandable, and it's legitimate. Unfortunately, it's being expressed right now over the past week in ways that are destructive. Minnesota's governor, Tim Walz, praise those who kept their protests peaceful. The raw emotions were on display, and, as I said yesterday, the beautiful expression of solidarity in community that we saw played out by peaceful protestors demonstrations elsewhere Saturday also began peacefully, right. More than two dozen cities nationwide had nighttime curfews in place, and protesters came out anyway, in some cases descending into chaos and destruction. Mayor Kesha Let's bottoms have seen two straight nights of protests in Atlanta. Right now we're talking about cars being burned and businesses being vandalized, and there's still so many issues that are right before us that we've lost. Sign up.

It's unclear if First Lady Melania Trump and Barron Trump were also taken down with him.Trump has repeatedly praised the Secret Service for its handling of the protests outside the White House Friday night in the wake of George Floyd's death last week in Minneapolis.The New York Times first reported Trump was taken to the bunker.The decision to physically move the president came as protesters confronted Secret Service officers outside the White House for hours on Friday — shouting, throwing water bottles and other objects at the line of officers, and attempting to break through the metal barriers.At times, the crowd would remove the metal barriers and begin pushing up against the officers and their riot shields. The Secret Service continually replaced the barriers throughout the night as protesters wrestled them away.Protesters pushed hard enough a few times that officers had to walk away with what appeared to be minor injuries. At one point, the agents responded to aggressive pushing and yelling by using pepper spray on the protesters.Throughout the night, protesters could be heard chanting their support for Floyd, an unarmed black man who died last week after being pinned down by a white police officer, and their dislike of Trump. The protest, which began around 10 p.m. ET, Friday night outside the White House, had mostly quieted down by 3:30 a.m. ET, Saturday morning.The crowd thinned out and Secret Service officers were able to expand their perimeter and barriers around Lafayette Park across from the White House.Six arrests were made during the protests, the Secret Service confirmed in a statement Saturday afternoon.The president on Thursday had used the threat of police retaliation and military intervention in Minnesota where protests turned violent and destructive — saying on Twitter that ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts.""Trump's tweets on Saturday also invoked imagery tied to brutal civil rights-era police tactics.Now, a serious divide has emerged among the President's top allies and advisers over how the president should address several nights of protests and riots.Trump is being urged by some advisers to formally address the nation and call for calm, while others have said he should condemn the rioting and looting more forcefully or risk losing middle-of-the-road voters in November, according to several sources familiar with the deliberations.",0.0

(KRQE) – A loud and crowded, but so far peaceful protest in downtown Albuquerque took place on Sunday in response to the death of George Floyd. The protest started near Central and University around 7:00 Sunday evening with thousands of protesters marching throughout the city wanting to bring justice for Floyd. “Honestly, it’s just about reform. We just want peace, no violence. The couple of chants you hear cursing and stating violence they’re not with us,” said protester Frankie Grady. Grady was one of the thousands of people who took part in the protest. As far as KRQE News 13 crews saw, the protest was peaceful, as people chanted “George Floyd,” and “black lives matter” from University and Central all the way down to 8th Street. Hundreds of people held signs while cars honked and people yelled chants as they marched down Central to UNM. KRQE News 13 crews caught a dumpster fire off Lead and Harvard, but police could not confirm if it was directly related to the protest. The protest followed a candlelight vigil for Floyd where hundreds of people paid their respects and listened to dozens of speakers share their thoughts on Floyd’s death. The social services organization Albuquerque Center for Peace and Justice organized the event hoping to make a difference. “This is not just another demonstration. It’s not just another vigil. It’s a call to commitment to make some things happen. We want to put an end to institutional racism,” said Jim Harvey of Albuquerque. Mayor Keller also made an appearance at the vigil. During his speech, a couple of people chanted “defund the police.” As far as KRQE News 13 saw Sunday evening, there were no confrontations with police. They maintained a block away distance from the protesters at all times. Organizers of the vigil wanted to make it clear they were not associated to the protest. However, by early Monday morning, protests turned violent as protesters started fires in the middle of Central and 3rd Street and even smashed out the windows of nearby businesses.

The protest started near Central and University around 7:00 Sunday evening with thousands of protesters marching throughout the city wanting to bring justice for Floyd. “Honestly, it’s just about reform. We just want peace, no violence. The couple of chants you hear cursing and stating violence they’re not with us,” said protester Frankie Grady. Grady was one of the thousands of people who took part in the protest. As far as KRQE News 13 crews saw, the protest was peaceful, as people chanted “George Floyd,” and “black lives matter” from University and Central all the way down to 8th Street. Hundreds of people held signs while cars honked and people yelled chants as they marched down Central to UNM. KRQE News 13 crews caught a dumpster fire off Lead and Harvard, but police could not confirm if it was directly related to the protest. The protest followed a candlelight vigil for Floyd where hundreds of people paid their respects and listened to dozens of speakers share their thoughts on Floyd’s death. The social services organization Albuquerque Center for Peace and Justice organized the event hoping to make a difference. “This is not just another demonstration. It’s not just another vigil. It’s a call to commitment to make some things happen. We want to put an end to institutional racism,” said Jim Harvey of Albuquerque. Mayor Keller also made an appearance at the vigil. During his speech, a couple of people chanted “defund the police.” As far as KRQE News 13 saw Sunday evening, there were no confrontations with police. They maintained a block away distance from the protesters at all times. Organizers of the vigil wanted to make it clear they were not associated to the protest. However, by early Monday morning, protests turned violent as protesters started fires in the middle of Central and 3rd Street and even smashed out the windows of nearby businesses. It’s unclear which group is responsible for the downtown protests that turned violent but it is not believed to be those with the Black Lives Matter demonstration. #BlackLivesMatter protest in Downtown Albuquerque right now.

It was the second time in a week that Biden left his home, following a brief Memorial Day wreath-laying ceremony at a veterans memorial in New Castle, Del. Biden has been campaigning exclusively from his house since coronavirus lockdowns began, repeatedly saying he is following stay-at-home orders issued by Delaware's governor. We are a nation in pain right now, but we must not allow this pain to destroy us.  As President, I will help lead this conversation — and more importantly, I will listen, just as I did today visiting the site of last night's protests in Wilmington. pic.twitter.com/0h2ApbKT0C — Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) May 31, 2020 As cities across the country have been overwhelmed by sometimes violent protests responding to Floyd's death — and as President Trump has stoked divisions with tweets about ""vicious dogs"" ready to respond to White House protests, labeling of Minnesota protesters as ""thugs"" and repeatedly blaming unrest on Democratic mayors and governors — Biden has tried to increase his visibility to portray a more empathetic and conciliatory approach to leadership. ""We are a nation in pain, but we must not allow this pain to destroy us,"" Biden wrote on Twitter and Facebook, alongside a picture of him on one knee, wearing a mask, speaking to a black man holding a child. ""We are a nation enraged, but we cannot allow our rage to consume us. We are a nation exhausted, but we will not allow our exhaustion to defeat us."" ""The only way to bear this pain is to turn all that anguish to purpose,"" Biden's post continued. ""And as President, I will help lead this conversation — and more importantly, I will listen, just as I did today visiting the site of last night's protests in Wilmington."" Biden's campaign posted a picture of the visit on social media but provided no additional information about how long Biden stayed at the protest site, how many people he talked to or when on Sunday he made the visit, which was not announced beforehand. While Biden and his campaign had purposely taken a low-visibility approach to the early days of the coronavirus crisis, preferring instead to keep the focus on President Trump and the daily press briefings credited with eroding the president's approval ratings, Biden has been much more responsive to Floyd's death and its aftermath, which have triggered a level of national protest not seen since the late 1960s. Biden delivered a five-minute speech from his Wilmington home Friday, framing Floyd's death as the latest example of a centuries old ""open wound"" of racism in the United States. Floyd's death, Biden said, was ""an act of brutality so elemental it did more than deny one black man in America his civil rights and human rights. It denied him of his very humanity and denied him of his life."" Earlier Friday, Biden spoke to Floyd's family on the phone. Floyd's brother, Philonise Floyd, told MSNBC on Saturday that during the call, ""I asked him could he please, please get justice for my brother."" A later call from President Trump, Floyd said, was much briefer. ""I was trying to talk to him, but he just kept, like, pushing me off,"" Floyd said. ",0.0

Some cities, including Minneapolis, Atlanta and Louisville, saw clashes with police, buildings and cars set afire, and looting. By evening, many demonstrations had given way to another night of violence and destruction, with protesters ignoring curfews imposed in dozens of cities. Police used tear gas and stun grenades and fired rubber bullets in attempts to disperse the crowds. More than 17,000 National Guard troops have been activated in states across the U.S. due to civil unrest as of Monday, and that number is expected to grow. Floyd, a 46-year-old black man, died in police custody last Monday. Video shows that a Minneapolis police officer had his knee on Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes shortly before his death. Tensions were already simmering following the deaths of Ahmaud Arbery in February and Breonna Taylor in March. Arbery, a 25-year-old black man, was jogging through a Glynn County, Ga., neighborhood when he was shot dead. Three white men were arrested last month after state investigators took over the case from local authorities. Protests also continued for a fourth straight night in Louisville, Ky., as activists called for justice for Taylor. Police shot and killed the 26-year-old black woman in her home. Truck barrels into Minneapolis protesters In Minneapolis, a semitrailer plowed through a crowd of protesters marching on an interstate highway near downtown that had been closed to traffic. Authorities say no one was injured when the truck drove into the crowd at a high speed, northbound on Interstate 35W. According to the Minnesota Department of Public Safety, the driver may have been unaware of the highway closure. ""It appears the semi was on I-35W as authorities were closing the road. It didn't appear to drive through any barricades,"" the department tweeted. Some protesters jumped on top of the truck, and as it stopped, they dragged the driver out of the front seat and started beating him. The driver, identified by police as Bogdan Vechirko of Otsego, Minn., is being held on probable cause for assault. He was taken to a hospital and is being treated for his injuries. ""He was driving a gas tanker,"" said Rhys Gailah, 39, who was in the middle of a sit-in listening to speakers when the truck came barreling through. ""He came driving at least 50 miles per hour through the crowd. Everyone was sitting. It was peaceful."" State Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington says authorities had shut down the freeway so that the protesters, who numbered from 4,000 to 5,000, could safely demonstrate. Before the incident, the protest had appeared peaceful. Tensions flare in the nation's capital Washington, D.C., authorities imposed a curfew after an evening of escalating demonstrations. Protesters threw bottles at police and set fires to cars and the basement of historic St. John's Church, which has been visited by every president since James Madison. ""Tonight's curfew will begin at 7 p.m. and will run for two days,"" D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser said at a late morning news conference on Monday. It's primary day in the nation's capital on Tuesday, and the curfew goes into effect an hour before polls close at 8 p.m., according to the District of Columbia Board of Elections website. The protests on Sunday began with peaceful marchers, along with a police escort, moving their way along a nearly 2-mile stretch from Howard University to Lafayette Square in front of the White House. Protesters chanted about the death of Floyd and other African Americans who have died following police violence. ""Even in the middle of a pandemic, cops are killing us,"" read a sign carried by protester Elizabeth Betts. ""It's crazy how even in the middle of a pandemic, black people have to protest like this,"" she said. ""We are at a point where it's the same story, the same things are happening. I'm tired of this."" But after clashes with law enforcement and the fires erupting, police pushed the crowds away from the White House with bursts of tear gas. Kentucky authorities investigate shooting death in Louisville Kentucky's governor said that one person died early Monday as security forces confronted a crowd in central Louisville. ""While working to disperse a crowd, [Louisville Metro Police Department] and the Kentucky National Guard were fired upon,"" Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said in a statement. ""LMPD and the Kentucky National Guard returned fire resulting in a death."" He announced that the Kentucky State Police will be investigating the matter.

Fischer also called for a Day of Reflection on Monday. He held a late morning virtual gathering on Facebook with faith leaders after another night of demonstrations in the city over the death of Breonna Taylor. On Sunday, law enforcement officers earlier fired tear gas into a crowd assembled in the Jefferson Square area of the city, NPR member station WFPL reported. At a Sunday evening news conference, Fischer again thanked those protesting peacefully but said others were ""hijacking"" their efforts. Tomorrow, Monday, June 1, 2020 I am declaring a Day of Reflection in our city. We will have a virtual gathering at 11:30 a.m. Monday on Facebook with local faith leaders. We’ll be talking about the events of the last few days & acknowledging the pain we’ve all felt. 2/2 — Mayor Greg Fischer (@louisvillemayor) June 1, 2020 Atlanta officers terminated for excessive force Two Atlanta police officers have been terminated and three others placed on desk duty after a video of the arrest of two young African Americans leaving the protests Saturday night went viral. Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms announced the officers' firing on Sunday, saying the footage ""was disturbing on many levels."" ""We understand our officers are working very long hours, under an enormous amount of stress,"" Bottoms said. ""But we also understand that the use of excessive force is never acceptable."" Georgia Public Broadcasting reported that veteran officers Mark Gardner and Ivory Streeter were terminated. The footage from Streeter's body camera shows the officers confronting the pair as the two were leaving the downtown protests after the 9 p.m. curfew went into effect. At roughly the 2:30 mark in the video, one of them is seen sitting in the driver's seat of a car, recording officers arresting someone else. An officer opens the car door and asks the driver if he wants to go to jail. Several minutes later, officers approach the car again. One uses a baton to smash the driver's side window. Police then use a stun gun on the driver, who has been identified by local media as Messiah Young. Georgia Public Broadcasting reported that Young suffered an epileptic seizure, according to Spelman College's Student Government Association. The second person, a woman who has since been identified as Taniyah Pilgrim, has been released from custody and charges against her dropped. Footage posted by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution shows the passenger pleading with police to stop as they also use a stun gun against her. ''They haven't heard us"": Protests escalate in Southern California Vandalism and violence broke out after peaceful protests in Santa Monica and other parts of Southern California on Sunday — a sequence of events that has become familiar in many U.S. cities in the past week. The new round of destruction came despite a curfew and the presence of the National Guard. ""We tried kneeling,"" protester Jesus Guzman, 19, told NPR's Doualy Xaykaothao near the Santa Monica Pier. ""We tried putting on those T-shirts that said 'I can't breathe.' We tried those hashtags. We tried doing it all peacefully, but they haven't heard us — they haven't done nothing."" ""The violence, for him, is justified,"" Xaykaothao reported. With store windows smashed, some shop owners in Santa Monica started cleaning up the mess overnight — the latest setback after weeks of forced closures because of the COVID-19 pandemic. At their hair salon, Martha Padilla-Bruni and her family were sweeping up broken glass under the streetlights. ""I'm in shock. I don't know what's going to happen,"" Padilla-Bruni told NPR's Nathan Rott. Her son, Joe Franco, said he supports the protesters and those who were there earlier in the day. He said he understands that people are in pain. Franco said, ""But I was here across the street, and what I saw, the people that were doing this ... they were not here to protest. They were here to cause trouble."" Reporter in Long Beach, Calif., hit in throat by rubber bullet KPCC/LAist reporter Adolfo Guzman-Lopez was hit in the throat by a rubber bullet Sunday evening during protests in Long Beach, Calif. He believes the bullet was fired by Long Beach police, who had been firing the projectiles nearby. ""I just got hit by a rubber bullet near the bottom of my throat,"" Guzman-Lopez said via Twitter, posting an image of his wound. ""I had just interviewed a man with my phone at 3rd and Pine and a police officer aimed and shot me in the throat, I saw the bullet bounce onto the street."" I just got hit by a rubber bullet near the bottom of my throat.

The reporter said he had just finished interviewing a man who had been kneeling in protest when he himself was hit. ""I talked to him for about a minute, and just as I was finishing talking to him — right after I said, 'Thank you' — I heard a pop and I felt something, you know, the bottom of my throat, and I saw something bounced onto the ground, and then I ran,"" he said. ""As I was running, I did start to feel its sting, and then I put my fingers to my throat and there was blood on my fingers."" A number of journalists have been hit with police projectiles during the protests, including MSNBC's Ali Velshi, who was shot in the leg by a rubber bullet in Minneapolis, and a Louisville TV reporter who was shot with pepper balls.

A peaceful Sunday night protest in Downtown Albuquerque erupted into chaos overnight as rioters fired shots at police, broke windows at several buildings and set multiple fires. There were also reports of some looting. “At this time there are no reports of injuries,” Albuquerque Police Department spokesman Gilbert Gallegos said in an early morning email. He said APD deployed emergency response teams to a large portion of Downtown to stop those who were vandalizing property and getting violent with officers. ADVERTISEMENTSkip ................................................................ Officers reported that someone fired shots at them in front of the Kimo Theater on the 400 block of Central. The aggression toward police didn’t stop there. Protesters taunted officers, shouting profanities at them. At one point, one man threw what appeared to be a Molotov cocktail toward police, though it didn’t hit anyone. A helicopter circled above after midnight ordering the group of 80 to 100 to disband or be arrested as two columns of police in riot gear, one at Second and Central and the other at Third and Central tried to break up the crowd. The riot police on Third and Central threw perhaps as many as six canisters of teargas at the group. Many in the crowd coughed as some tried to throw the canisters back at police. Protestors scattered south of Central, although many of them were throwing objects at officers. Earlier on Sunday night, hundreds marched down Central to protest the death of George Floyd, a black man killed on Memorial Day as police in Minnesota took him into custody. Protests were held throughout the country on Sunday, and many of them turned violent. In Albuquerque, marchers started at the University of New Mexico and blocked most of Central as they made their way west to Robinson Park in Downtown Albuquerque chanting, “I can’t breathe.” Many carried homemade signs. “Being black is not a death sentence,” read one; “silence is violence,” read another. The group reached Robinson Park, at 8th and Central, around 8 p.m. They observed a moment of silence, many raising a fist in the air, before turning back toward UNM. ADVERTISEMENTSkip ................................................................ The crowd began to disperse when the march made it back to University and Central, where the protest began. But by 11:30 p.m., the peaceful demonstration began turning chaotic as one male tried breaking a window at the NYPD Pizza Department off Second and Central. Shortly thereafter, a dumpster fire was burning south of Central and Third while another fire was smoldering at the intersection of Third and Central. Yet another dumpster fire was burning at Gold and Second, while a trash fire was set at Third and Gold. Rioters could also be seen throwing objects at the windows of buildings at Third and Gold. Several buildings along Central and along Gold also had their windows broken. A number of buildings were also vandalized with graffiti, including ACAB (all cops are b——-.) The APD, Bernalillo County Sheriff’s office and State Police all responded, including APD’s horse unit. By about 2:30 a.m., most of the protesters had left and law enforcement was doing a sweep of the area.",0.0

Some cities, including Minneapolis, Atlanta and Louisville, saw clashes with police, buildings and cars set afire, and looting. By evening, many demonstrations had given way to another night of violence and destruction, with protesters ignoring curfews imposed in dozens of cities. Police used tear gas and stun grenades and fired rubber bullets in attempts to disperse the crowds. More than 17,000 National Guard troops have been activated in states across the U.S. due to civil unrest as of Monday, and that number is expected to grow. Floyd, a 46-year-old black man, died in police custody last Monday. Video shows that a Minneapolis police officer had his knee on Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes shortly before his death. Tensions were already simmering following the deaths of Ahmaud Arbery in February and Breonna Taylor in March. Arbery, a 25-year-old black man, was jogging through a Glynn County, Ga., neighborhood when he was shot dead. Three white men were arrested last month after state investigators took over the case from local authorities. Protests also continued for a fourth straight night in Louisville, Ky., as activists called for justice for Taylor. Police shot and killed the 26-year-old black woman in her home. Truck barrels into Minneapolis protesters In Minneapolis, a semitrailer plowed through a crowd of protesters marching on an interstate highway near downtown that had been closed to traffic. Authorities say no one was injured when the truck drove into the crowd at a high speed, northbound on Interstate 35W. According to the Minnesota Department of Public Safety, the driver may have been unaware of the highway closure. ""It appears the semi was on I-35W as authorities were closing the road. It didn't appear to drive through any barricades,"" the department tweeted. Some protesters jumped on top of the truck, and as it stopped, they dragged the driver out of the front seat and started beating him. The driver, identified by police as Bogdan Vechirko of Otsego, Minn., is being held on probable cause for assault. He was taken to a hospital and is being treated for his injuries. ""He was driving a gas tanker,"" said Rhys Gailah, 39, who was in the middle of a sit-in listening to speakers when the truck came barreling through. ""He came driving at least 50 miles per hour through the crowd. Everyone was sitting. It was peaceful."" State Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington says authorities had shut down the freeway so that the protesters, who numbered from 4,000 to 5,000, could safely demonstrate. Before the incident, the protest had appeared peaceful. Tensions flare in the nation's capital Washington, D.C., authorities imposed a curfew after an evening of escalating demonstrations. Protesters threw bottles at police and set fires to cars and the basement of historic St. John's Church, which has been visited by every president since James Madison. ""Tonight's curfew will begin at 7 p.m. and will run for two days,"" D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser said at a late morning news conference on Monday. It's primary day in the nation's capital on Tuesday, and the curfew goes into effect an hour before polls close at 8 p.m., according to the District of Columbia Board of Elections website. The protests on Sunday began with peaceful marchers, along with a police escort, moving their way along a nearly 2-mile stretch from Howard University to Lafayette Square in front of the White House. Protesters chanted about the death of Floyd and other African Americans who have died following police violence. ""Even in the middle of a pandemic, cops are killing us,"" read a sign carried by protester Elizabeth Betts. ""It's crazy how even in the middle of a pandemic, black people have to protest like this,"" she said. ""We are at a point where it's the same story, the same things are happening. I'm tired of this."" But after clashes with law enforcement and the fires erupting, police pushed the crowds away from the White House with bursts of tear gas. Kentucky authorities investigate shooting death in Louisville Kentucky's governor said that one person died early Monday as security forces confronted a crowd in central Louisville. ""While working to disperse a crowd, [Louisville Metro Police Department] and the Kentucky National Guard were fired upon,"" Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said in a statement. ""LMPD and the Kentucky National Guard returned fire resulting in a death."" He announced that the Kentucky State Police will be investigating the matter. Statement from Governor Andy Beshear: pic.twitter.com/MyHxcE3Ntn — Governor Andy Beshear (@GovAndyBeshear) June 1, 2020 Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer tweeted his ""deepest condolences"" for the family of the man, whom he identified as David McAtee. Fischer also called for a Day of Reflection on Monday. He held a late morning virtual gathering on Facebook with faith leaders after another night of demonstrations in the city over the death of Breonna Taylor. On Sunday, law enforcement officers earlier fired tear gas into a crowd assembled in the Jefferson Square area of the city, NPR member station WFPL reported. At a Sunday evening news conference, Fischer again thanked those protesting peacefully but said others were ""hijacking"" their efforts. Tomorrow, Monday, June 1, 2020 I am declaring a Day of Reflection in our city. We will have a virtual gathering at 11:30 a.m. Monday on Facebook with local faith leaders. We’ll be talking about the events of the last few days & acknowledging the pain we’ve all felt. 2/2 — Mayor Greg Fischer (@louisvillemayor) June 1, 2020 Atlanta officers terminated for excessive force Two Atlanta police officers have been terminated and three others placed on desk duty after a video of the arrest of two young African Americans leaving the protests Saturday night went viral. Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms announced the officers' firing on Sunday, saying the footage ""was disturbing on many levels."" ""We understand our officers are working very long hours, under an enormous amount of stress,"" Bottoms said. ""But we also understand that the use of excessive force is never acceptable."" Georgia Public Broadcasting reported that veteran officers Mark Gardner and Ivory Streeter were terminated. The footage from Streeter's body camera shows the officers confronting the pair as the two were leaving the downtown protests after the 9 p.m. curfew went into effect. At roughly the 2:30 mark in the video, one of them is seen sitting in the driver's seat of a car, recording officers arresting someone else. An officer opens the car door and asks the driver if he wants to go to jail. Several minutes later, officers approach the car again. One uses a baton to smash the driver's side window. Police then use a stun gun on the driver, who has been identified by local media as Messiah Young. Georgia Public Broadcasting reported that Young suffered an epileptic seizure, according to Spelman College's Student Government Association. The second person, a woman who has since been identified as Taniyah Pilgrim, has been released from custody and charges against her dropped. Footage posted by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution shows the passenger pleading with police to stop as they also use a stun gun against her.

A volunteer from the neighborhood walks out onto Lake Street. ""Is this your business?"" she asks. Safia and her daughter Saida Hassan nod silently. ""I'm sorry,"" the woman says. It's the first time they've seen it since fiery protests erupted among cries for racial justice and as state troopers in riot gear blocked the road to this street. The walls are charred black, the kitchen reduced to rubble. Glass and water are swimming in puddles as community members around them work to sweep away the destruction. Safia looks around stunned. Hers is one of hundreds of businesses damaged or destroyed in protests on Thursday and Friday night. ""Alhamdulillah,"" she repeats quietly. Praise God. ""Everyone is safe."" ""My heart is broken. My mind is broken,"" she says. ""I know I can't come back from this. But this can be replaced. George's life cannot. George's life was more important. That man that got killed in the most inhumane way. I hope he gets justice."" George Floyd is the African American man who died after a white police officer pinned his neck to the ground with his knee for several minutes last Monday. Protests started in Minneapolis early last week and quickly spread across the country. Floyd's pleading words to the officer, ""I can't breathe,"" are now a rallying cry for people protesting the many black people who have died in police custody. Safia, a Somali immigrant, opened the restaurant in December 2018 with her retirement savings. In the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, she closed the restaurant and had to choose between paying for insurance and paying staff. So Safia chose her staff. That means there are no funds to rebuild. A GoFundMe page has been set up to help the family. This weekend, she had planned to reopen as the city started easing stay-at-home orders. She spent over $4,000 on groceries and cleanup. Now that plan is gone. ""It's not just me,"" she says. ""It's all of Lake Street, all of Minneapolis."" Her daughter Saida nods. ""This is a city in pain,"" Saida says. Across the street a row of restaurants — all locally owned, black- and immigrant-owned — are all gone. But the library is OK. In the rubble, Saida finds the sign she made for her mother when the restaurant first opened. Against the black ash the wood plaque is pristine. It reads ""Mama Safia's Kitchen. Seasoned with Love."" ""Because she always cooks with love,"" Saida says. She pulls a few more knickknacks that haven't burned. ""Most of the artifacts here, I got them from Africa,"" she says. ""This one is from Somalia."" She puts them into a tiny pile of what is salvageable. Outside is a tower of all that is lost. Her sister Bibi Abdullah walks in to help. She finds prayer rugs in the banquet room her mom would rent out for small wedding dinners and religious holidays. ""We can still use these,"" she says. ""We just have to wash them."" She searches for more things she can save. ""The truth is things like this happen when people feel powerless. Something has to change,"" Bibi says. Her voice catches. Her body seems to vibrate with a mix of anger and sadness. She says she hopes that these demonstrations translate to voters at the polls come November. ""It came to this because we have people that do not care in positions of power and it should not be that way,"" Bibi says. She and her sister start to clear the big debris together. Then Saida leads her mother, Safia, to the kitchen in the back so they can assess the damage. It's a tunnel of charred walls, ash and debris. Safia gets upset and pulls away, speaking to her daughter in Somali. ""I'm sorry, I'm sorry,"" Saida responds in English as her mother walks out. ""She's just saying, 'Why are you bringing me in here? I don't want to see this,' "" Saida says. Saida gets quiet. She stands in the kitchen alone for a moment, staring at the charred walls. Then she joins her family outside where dozens of Minneapolis residents from across the city are working in groups to clear the rubble. With everything unfolding, the pandemic has slipped many people's minds. ""I forgot. Have you seen me shake hands with people?"" Saida shakes her head. ""2020, we hear you, we see you. We went from one crisis to the next. What's next?"" Saida spends every night protesting, but also trying to protect other locally owned stores and restaurants. At night, she cries herself to sleep. She understands the anger and desperation that are leading some to destroy buildings. ""I'm like emotionally torn,"" Saida says. She doesn't want destruction. ""But at the same time, people are crying for help. People are saying, 'Fix this.' "" She says she hopes, from all of this pain, finally there will be change. ",0.0

Racial wounds have been ripped open following the death of George Floyd, an unarmed black man in police custody in Minneapolis. The chaotic demonstrations and looting across the country have been blamed on outsiders of various political stripes, particularly ""radical-left"" groups like antifa, which is short for ""anti-fascist."" But the country is at an especially explosive moment, coming in the midst of a pandemic that has already killed more than 100,000 and an economic crisis with more than 40 million Americans unemployed — and in an election year no less. There's no telling how this plays out politically in November, with the election now five months away. Anything can happen. Five months ago, after all, the coronavirus was just a ""pneumonia of unknown cause."" President Trump called Floyd's death a ""grave tragedy"" that ""should never have happened."" Those remarks were made at the first launching of American astronauts into space from U.S. soil in almost a decade — what was one of the hopeful bright spots in this country, though it was overshadowed by the violent demonstrations. But once Trump was back on his favorite platform, Twitter, he again inflamed tensions, with machismo and politics at the forefront. He criticized local Democratic officials, saying Minneapolis's mayor, for example, was no ""General Douglas McArthur [sic] or great fighter General George Patton."" He has called demonstrators ""THUGS"" and warned that ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts"" — though he later said he didn't use that phrase as a threat. And he has employed violent, tough-guy imagery, alluding to the potential use of ""unlimited"" military power, ""vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons."" Even some Republicans criticized the president's language. Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, the only black Republican in the Senate, called the president's tweets ""not constructive"" on Fox News Sunday. And Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan told CNN that Trump is ""continuing to escalate the temperature,"" which is the ""opposite"" of what a leader should be doing right now. Meanwhile, Trump's national security adviser, Robert O'Brien, on Sunday waded into a crucial debate — whether there's ""systemic racism"" in police forces or whether there are just a few ""bad apples."" ""I don't think there's systemic racism"" in law enforcement, O'Brien said on CNN, ""but, you know what, there are some bad apples in there. ... There's no doubt there are some racist police"" but, he said, they're the minority. Americans are divided on their views of police. Back in mid-2017, Gallup found that 54% of Americans have a great deal or quite a lot of confidence in the police. But there were very different views by race. While 61% of whites had that level of confidence in police, just 45% of Hispanics and 30% of blacks did. Confidence in police nosedived among minorities and liberals after the rash of high-profile incidents of black men killed at the hands of police in 2014 and 2015, such as Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., Eric Garner in New York and Freddie Gray in Baltimore. Views of the police and law enforcement have become a sharp dividing line by race and party. In 2016, Trump declared himself the ""law and order candidate."" Expect him to try to exploit that again as a wedge issue in an effort to win over moderate whites upset by the video of Floyd's death but disapproving of the violent demonstrations. He said as much Sunday. He called for ""Law & Order in Philadelphia, NOW!"" and announced that the United States would be designating antifa a terrorist organization. Expect presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden and other Democrats now to have to answer if they agree or disagree with the antifa designation. Of course, it's also possible that Trump went too far already, something some advisers are privately concerned about, and that his rhetoric could hurt him with independents and suburban women. 5 things to watch this week 1. Trump's response to unrest: How Trump responds this week to the violent demonstrations and race relations in America could be consequential. Will it be Teleprompter Trump or Twitter Trump, or both at the same time once again? Florida Rep. Val Demings, who's on the shortlist to be Joe Biden's presidential running mate, said on NBC's Meet the Press on Sunday: ""If there ever was a time we need leadership in the White House, it is now, to help heal our nation, but I don't know why I would expect this president to do something that he has never done before."" 2. The great American coronavirus experiment: It's the first day of June, and with it, many states are making continued steps into phased reopenings. April and May saw more than 100,000 people die in the U.S. from the coronavirus. Some health experts have warned that a resurgence in cases could take place if Americans don't adhere to strict social distancing, or take other precautions like wear masks. The White House has also said that cases could go down in the warmer summer months. Does that happen? And if so, do Americans get too comfortable and lapse into a false sense of security — only to see a spike in the fall? None of it's clear, but the U.S. is heading into a period of pandemic experimentation with no vaccine or cure for the coronavirus as yet. 3. Could Steve King lose? Steny Hoyer faces challenge: It's hard to believe, but there are elections on Tuesday. Two of the marquee races deal with well-known — and very different — political figures. Controversial Rep. Steve King, with a history of making racist remarks, is in a fight for his political life with state Sen. Randy Feenstra in Iowa's Republican primary. Conservative groups have lined up against King, but he can't be counted out. This district has a long history of voting for him, despite his pariah status within the party. In Maryland, Steny Hoyer, No. 2 in House Democratic leadership, is facing a primary challenge from the left in 29-year-old McKayla Wilkes, inspired by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's unlikely win in New York over Joe Crowley, a former congressional Democratic leader. Iowa, Maryland and several other states, plus Washington, D.C., hold primaries Tuesday. 4. Biden to get closer to officially clinching nomination: Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee, is on the ballot Tuesday, too. Remember, he still hasn't acquired the delegates needed to officially put him over the top for the nomination. He is 425 delegates short of doing that. With 500 at stake Tuesday, Biden needs 85% of them Tuesday to clinch. That's unlikely, so look at next week, June 9, when Georgia and West Virginia vote — with their 133 delegates up for grabs — for Biden to hit the magic number of 1,991. (Follow all the math here with the NPR delegate tracker.) 5. Origins of Trump campaign investigation to be probed: In Congress, former Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein will testify Wednesday before the Senate Judiciary Committee, which is looking into the origins of the FBI's investigation into members of the 2016 Trump campaign. The Senate is also expected to vote on nominations, including for the Treasury Department's inspector general for the pandemic response. And action is possible on changes to the Paycheck Protection Program, or PPP. Last week, the House, nearly unanimously, passed a bill that reduces the percentage of the loans that businesses have to use toward payroll and gives businesses more time to spend the money and to pay the loans back. Flashback quotation: ""When you see these thugs being thrown into the back of a paddy wagon, you just seen them thrown in, rough. I said, 'Please don't be too nice.' When you guys put somebody in the car and you're protecting their head you know, the way you put their hand over [their head]. Like, 'Don't hit their head, and they've just killed somebody, don't hit their head.' I said, 'You can take the hand away, OK?'

A volunteer from the neighborhood walks out onto Lake Street. ""Is this your business?"" she asks. Safia and her daughter Saida Hassan nod silently. ""I'm sorry,"" the woman says. It's the first time they've seen it since fiery protests erupted among cries for racial justice and as state troopers in riot gear blocked the road to this street. The walls are charred black, the kitchen reduced to rubble. Glass and water are swimming in puddles as community members around them work to sweep away the destruction. Safia looks around stunned. Hers is one of hundreds of businesses damaged or destroyed in protests on Thursday and Friday night. ""Alhamdulillah,"" she repeats quietly. Praise God. ""Everyone is safe."" ""My heart is broken. My mind is broken,"" she says. ""I know I can't come back from this. But this can be replaced. George's life cannot. George's life was more important. That man that got killed in the most inhumane way. I hope he gets justice."" George Floyd is the African American man who died after a white police officer pinned his neck to the ground with his knee for several minutes last Monday. Protests started in Minneapolis early last week and quickly spread across the country. Floyd's pleading words to the officer, ""I can't breathe,"" are now a rallying cry for people protesting the many black people who have died in police custody. Safia, a Somali immigrant, opened the restaurant in December 2018 with her retirement savings. In the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, she closed the restaurant and had to choose between paying for insurance and paying staff. So Safia chose her staff. That means there are no funds to rebuild. A GoFundMe page has been set up to help the family. This weekend, she had planned to reopen as the city started easing stay-at-home orders. She spent over $4,000 on groceries and cleanup. Now that plan is gone. ""It's not just me,"" she says. ""It's all of Lake Street, all of Minneapolis."" Her daughter Saida nods. ""This is a city in pain,"" Saida says. Across the street a row of restaurants — all locally owned, black- and immigrant-owned — are all gone. But the library is OK. In the rubble, Saida finds the sign she made for her mother when the restaurant first opened. Against the black ash the wood plaque is pristine. It reads ""Mama Safia's Kitchen. Seasoned with Love."" ""Because she always cooks with love,"" Saida says. She pulls a few more knickknacks that haven't burned. ""Most of the artifacts here, I got them from Africa,"" she says. ""This one is from Somalia."" She puts them into a tiny pile of what is salvageable. Outside is a tower of all that is lost. Her sister Bibi Abdullah walks in to help. She finds prayer rugs in the banquet room her mom would rent out for small wedding dinners and religious holidays. ""We can still use these,"" she says. ""We just have to wash them."" She searches for more things she can save. ""The truth is things like this happen when people feel powerless. Something has to change,"" Bibi says. Her voice catches. Her body seems to vibrate with a mix of anger and sadness. She says she hopes that these demonstrations translate to voters at the polls come November. ""It came to this because we have people that do not care in positions of power and it should not be that way,"" Bibi says. She and her sister start to clear the big debris together. Then Saida leads her mother, Safia, to the kitchen in the back so they can assess the damage. It's a tunnel of charred walls, ash and debris. Safia gets upset and pulls away, speaking to her daughter in Somali. ""I'm sorry, I'm sorry,"" Saida responds in English as her mother walks out. ""She's just saying, 'Why are you bringing me in here? I don't want to see this,' "" Saida says. Saida gets quiet. She stands in the kitchen alone for a moment, staring at the charred walls. Then she joins her family outside where dozens of Minneapolis residents from across the city are working in groups to clear the rubble. With everything unfolding, the pandemic has slipped many people's minds. ""I forgot. Have you seen me shake hands with people?"" Saida shakes her head. ""2020, we hear you, we see you. We went from one crisis to the next. What's next?"" Saida spends every night protesting, but also trying to protect other locally owned stores and restaurants. At night, she cries herself to sleep. She understands the anger and desperation that are leading some to destroy buildings. ""I'm like emotionally torn,"" Saida says. She doesn't want destruction. ""But at the same time, people are crying for help. People are saying, 'Fix this.' "" She says she hopes, from all of this pain, finally there will be change. ",0.0
1622147469,2020-06-01 05:00:00,Trump Seems Likely To Use Law And Order As A Wedge Issue After George Floyd's Killing,https://www.krwg.org/post/trump-seems-likely-use-law-and-order-wedge-issue-after-george-floyds-killing,en,False,,214420,krwg.org,http://krwg.org/,"Through days of unrest, dozens of American cities — from Minneapolis to Atlanta, from New York to Grand Rapids, Mich. — have been wracked by violent protests. Racial wounds have been ripped open following the death of George Floyd, an unarmed black man in police custody in Minneapolis. The chaotic demonstrations and looting across the country have been blamed on outsiders of various political stripes, particularly ""radical-left"" groups like antifa, which is short for ""anti-fascist."" But the country is at an especially explosive moment, coming in the midst of a pandemic that has already killed more than 100,000 and an economic crisis with more than 40 million Americans unemployed — and in an election year no less. There's no telling how this plays out politically in November, with the election now five months away. Anything can happen. Five months ago, after all, the coronavirus was just a ""pneumonia of unknown cause."" President Trump called Floyd's death a ""grave tragedy"" that ""should never have happened."" Those remarks were made at the first launching of American astronauts into space from U.S. soil in almost a decade — what was one of the hopeful bright spots in this country, though it was overshadowed by the violent demonstrations. But once Trump was back on his favorite platform, Twitter, he again inflamed tensions, with machismo and politics at the forefront. He criticized local Democratic officials, saying Minneapolis's mayor, for example, was no ""General Douglas McArthur [sic] or great fighter General George Patton."" He has called demonstrators ""THUGS"" and warned that ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts"" — though he later said he didn't use that phrase as a threat. And he has employed violent, tough-guy imagery, alluding to the potential use of ""unlimited"" military power, ""vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons."" Even some Republicans criticized the president's language. Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, the only black Republican in the Senate, called the president's tweets ""not constructive"" on Fox News Sunday. And Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan told CNN that Trump is ""continuing to escalate the temperature,"" which is the ""opposite"" of what a leader should be doing right now. Meanwhile, Trump's national security adviser, Robert O'Brien, on Sunday waded into a crucial debate — whether there's ""systemic racism"" in police forces or whether there are just a few ""bad apples."" ""I don't think there's systemic racism"" in law enforcement, O'Brien said on CNN, ""but, you know what, there are some bad apples in there. ... There's no doubt there are some racist police"" but, he said, they're the minority. Americans are divided on their views of police. Back in mid-2017, Gallup found that 54% of Americans have a great deal or quite a lot of confidence in the police. But there were very different views by race. While 61% of whites had that level of confidence in police, just 45% of Hispanics and 30% of blacks did. Confidence in police nosedived among minorities and liberals after the rash of high-profile incidents of black men killed at the hands of police in 2014 and 2015, such as Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., Eric Garner in New York and Freddie Gray in Baltimore. Views of the police and law enforcement have become a sharp dividing line by race and party. In 2016, Trump declared himself the ""law and order candidate."" Expect him to try to exploit that again as a wedge issue in an effort to win over moderate whites upset by the video of Floyd's death but disapproving of the violent demonstrations. He said as much Sunday. He called for ""Law & Order in Philadelphia, NOW!"" and announced that the United States would be designating antifa a terrorist organization. Expect presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden and other Democrats now to have to answer if they agree or disagree with the antifa designation. Of course, it's also possible that Trump went too far already, something some advisers are privately concerned about, and that his rhetoric could hurt him with independents and suburban women. 5 things to watch this week 1. Trump's response to unrest: How Trump responds this week to the violent demonstrations and race relations in America could be consequential. Will it be Teleprompter Trump or Twitter Trump, or both at the same time once again? Florida Rep. Val Demings, who's on the shortlist to be Joe Biden's presidential running mate, said on NBC's Meet the Press on Sunday: ""If there ever was a time we need leadership in the White House, it is now, to help heal our nation, but I don't know why I would expect this president to do something that he has never done before."" 2. The great American coronavirus experiment: It's the first day of June, and with it, many states are making continued steps into phased reopenings. April and May saw more than 100,000 people die in the U.S. from the coronavirus.

The National Bureau of Economic Research declared Monday that the recession began in February.The U.S. government's current supply of remdesivir, the only drug known to work against coronavirus, will run out at the end of the month.New World Health Organization guidance recommends that fabric masks — which can be homemade — be at least three layers.While states lift more restrictions and more Americans go out to socialize or protest, almost half of U.S states are seeing higher rates of new coronavirus cases.But the situation would have been much worse had states not shut down, a new study says.More than 1.9 million Americans have been infected, and more than 110,000 have died in just over four months, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.Nationwide, 22 states are seeing upward trends in coronavirus cases. About 20 states have seen decreases in recent days, and eight states are holding steady. One of the states with the biggest spikes in new cases is Florida. The number of new cases reported each day has increased an average of roughly 46% over the past week, just as most of the state entered a second phase of reopening.While big cities on the coasts were hit hard early in the pandemic, the past few weeks have seen wider spread in inland states, including Arkansas, Texas and Arizona.In Utah, state Rep. Suzanne Harrison called a recent spike of cases ""very concerning (and) approaching exponential.""""Today's 18.5% positive test rate is double yesterday's (9.4%),"" she tweeted over the weekend.Friday, health officials in Utah said they were ""very concerned"" about the rise in new cases over the past week.The state has recorded more than 12,000 infections, according to Johns Hopkins.Health officials raise concerns of virus spreading among protestsHealth officials have raised concern about coronavirus spread as thousands of people are now braving a pandemic to participate in the national protests sparked by the death of George Floyd.The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Sunday it was closely monitoring the demonstrations taking place across the U.S. and warned such gatherings could spur coronavirus transmission. Some states are already seeing upward trends of new cases.For three months, the country passed one grim milestone after the other, hitting 100,000 coronavirus deaths in late May. Public health officials have said without the lockdowns that most states put in place, that death toll could have been significantly higher.As those lockdowns were lifted and other measures were loosened, the CDC and other top health officials urged Americans to use face coverings when they go out and always maintain a distance.But the large protests make it hard to keep the recommended social distancing guidelines and ""may put others at risk,"" CDC spokesperson Kristen Nordlund said in a statement.""It is too early to know what, if any, effect these events will have on the federal COVID-19 response. Every local situation is different. State and local officials will make decisions to protect public health and safety based on circumstances on the ground,"" she said.Earlier this month, CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield said protesters should be evaluated and tested for the virus.""I do think there is a potential, unfortunately, for this to be a seeding event,"" he said — especially in metropolitan areas where there has been significant transmission.So far, more than 1,942,000 people have been infected in the U.S., and at least 110,514 have died, according to Johns Hopkins University.Some states see rise in new casesWhile the early parts of the outbreak in the country hit dense metropolitan areas on the coast the hardest — including California and New York — the past few weeks have seen wider spread in inland states, including Arkansas, Texas and Arizona.In Harris County, Texas, health officials said they identified a nursing home with both cases of the virus and deaths.On Friday, health officials in Utah said they were ""very concerned"" about the rise in new cases over the past week.The state has recorded more than 12,000 infections, according to Johns Hopkins.""When you're away from home, please avoid close contact with others, and wear a mask when other social distancing measures aren't feasible,"" the Utah Department of Health said on Twitter. Utah State Rep. Suzanne Harrison called the spike of cases ""very concerning (and) approaching exponential.""""Today's 18.5% positive test rate is double yesterday's (9.4%),"" she tweeted over the weekend. ""Please be careful. Practice social distancing. Avoid crowds. Use masks where appropriate. Wash your hands.""Several universities have also reported new cases within their athletic programs — including Arkansas State, Auburn University and Oklahoma State University.An important drug could run out Meanwhile, as officials emphasize the U.S. is not yet out of the woods, a government official gave a stark warning. The U.S. government's current supply of remdesivir, the only drug known to work against coronavirus, will run out at the end of the month, Dr. Robert Kadlec, a U.S. Department of Health and Human Services official, told CNN.The government's last shipment of the drug will go out the week of June 29. Gilead Sciences, the company that makes the drug, is ramping up to make more, but it's unclear how much will be available this summer.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration gave emergency authorization for remdesivir last month. The drug, an intravenous antiviral medication studied to treat Ebola, is now used on hospitalized Covid patients. A study has shown it helps cut down the length of hospital stays.The government has been working to help Gilead ""with some of their supply chain challenges in terms of raw materials and being able to accelerate the process,"" Kadlec said.""Whatever the supply may be, there may not be enough for everyone who may need it,"" he said.",0.0

Yet the message Trump appeared to be sending with the brazen pushback of protesters outside the White House was that he sees few limits to what he is willing to do. Some around the president likened the moment to 1968, when Richard Nixon ran as the law-and-order candidate in the aftermath of a summer of riots, capturing the White House. But despite his efforts to portray himself as a political outsider, Trump is an incumbent who risks being held responsible for the violence. Minutes before Trump began speaking, police and National Guard soldiers began aggressively forcing back hundreds of peaceful protesters who had gathered in Lafayette Park, across the street from the White House, where they were chanting against police brutality and Floyd’s death in Minneapolis. As Trump spoke, tear gas canisters could be heard exploding. Floyd died last week after he was pinned to the pavement by a police officer who put his knee on the handcuffed black man’s neck until he stopped breathing. His death set off protests that spread from Minneapolis across America. His brother Terrence pleaded with protesters on Monday to remain peaceful. Five months before Election Day, the president made clear that he would stake his reelection efforts on convincing voters that his strong-arm approach was warranted to quell the most intense civil unrest since the 1960s. He made little effort to address the grievances of black Americans and others outraged by Floyd’s death and the scourge of police brutality, undermining what his campaign had hoped would be increased appeal to African American voters. The scene in and around the White House on Monday night appeared to be carefully orchestrated. As the crowd of protesters grew, Attorney General William Barr arrived in Lafayette Park to look over at the demonstrations and the swarm of law enforcement. The sudden shift in tactics against the protesters was initially a mystery. Then, after finishing his Rose Garden remarks, Trump emerged from the White House gates and walked through the park to St. John’s Church, where an office had been set on fire the previous night. ADVERTISEMENTSkip ................................................................ Trump, who rarely attends church, held up a Bible and gathered a group of advisers — all white — to pose for photos. The moment was quickly decried by Trump’s critics, with New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo saying the president “used the military to push out a peaceful protest so he could have a photo op at a church.” “It’s all just a reality TV show for this president,” he said on Twitter. “Shameful.” Federal law permits presidents to dispatch the military into states to suppress an insurrection or if a state is defying federal law, legal experts said. But Trump’s statements also set up an immediate conflict with officials in New York and other states who asserted that the president does not have the unilateral right to send in troops against the will of local governments. The country has been beset by angry demonstrations for the past week in some of the most widespread racial unrest in the U.S. since the 1960s. Spurred largely by Floyd’s death, protesters have taken to the streets to decry the killings of black people by police. Minneapolis Officer Derek Chauvin has been charged with murder, but protesters are demanding that three of his colleagues be prosecuted, too. All four were fired. While most of the demonstrations have been peaceful, others have descended into violence, leaving neighborhoods in shambles, stores ransacked, windows broken and cars burned, despite curfews around the country and the deployment of thousands of National Guard members in at least 15 states. On Monday, demonstrations erupted from Philadelphia, where hundreds of protesters spilled onto a highway in the heart of the city, to Atlanta, where police fired tear gas at demonstrators, to Nashville, where more than 60 National Guard soldiers put down their riot shields at the request of peaceful protesters who had gathered in front of Tennessee’s state Capitol to honor Floyd. Two people were killed during protests in the Chicago suburb of Cicero, authorities said, but provided no details. In Louisville, Kentucky, riot police firing tear gas scattered several hundred protesters from downtown, violently capping a day of mostly peaceful protests. A vehicle plowed through a group of law enforcement officers at a demonstration in Buffalo, New York, injuring at least two. Video from the scene showed the vehicle accelerating through an intersection shortly after officers apparently tackled a protester and handcuffed him. The officers were hospitalized in stable condition, authorities said. ADVERTISEMENTSkip ................................................................ In New York City, where nightfall has brought widespread scenes of destruction, large crowds rallied peacefully in Times Square and Brooklyn during the day. Then, in early evening, looters rushed into a Nike store in Manhattan and protesters smashed storefront windows near Rockefeller Center. Video posted on social media showed some protesters arguing with people breaking windows, urging them to stop. The city has already endured immense commercial damage from the unrest. On Monday, rioters got through the doors of the city’s flagship Macy’s store, famous for its Thanksgiving Day parade, and police later pulled at least two handcuffed men out of the store and put them into a van. By that time, most of the the street was littered with broken glass. In Washington, protesters continued marching peacefully through Washington hours after being forced from Lafayette park and past the 7 p.m. curfew. Eventually, within sight of the Capitol building, the marchers were turned back by law enforcement officers using tear gas, pellets and low-flying helicopters kicking up debris. As they dispersed, some protesters smashed windows at a nearby office building. Earlier Monday, Trump told the nation’s governors in a video conference that they “look like fools” for not deploying even more National Guard troops. “Most of you are weak,” he said. He added: “You’ve got to arrest people, you have to track people, you have to put them in jail for 10 years and you’ll never see this stuff again.” Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, a Democrat, dismissed Trump’s comments as the “rantings of an insecure man trying to look strong after building his entire political career on racism.” Former Vice President Joe Biden, the Democratic presidential candidate, vowed to address institutional racism in his first 100 days in office. He met in person with black leaders in Delaware and also held a virtual meeting with big-city mayors. ADVERTISEMENTSkip ................................................................ Biden said hate emerges “when you have somebody in power who breathes oxygen into the hate.” In Minneapolis, meanwhile, Floyd’s brother Terrence made an emotional plea for peace at the site where Floyd was arrested. “Let’s switch it up, y’all. Let’s switch it up. Do this peacefully, please,” Terrence Floyd said as he urged people to use their power at the ballot box. Also Monday, an autopsy commissioned for Floyd’s family found that he died of asphyxiation from neck and back compression, the family’s attorneys said. Authorities in many cities have blamed the violence on outside agitators, though have provided little evidence to back that up. But on Monday, federal authorities arrested a 28-year-old Illinois man saying he had posted self-recorded video on his Facebook page last week that showed him in Minneapolis handing out explosive devices and encouraging people to throw them at law enforcement officers. More than 5,600 people nationwide have been arrested over the past week for such offenses as stealing, blocking highways and breaking curfew, according to a count by The Associated Press. ___ Sullivan and Morrison reported from Minneapolis.

(KRQE) – Protests in Albuquerque turned violent overnight over the death of Minneapolis man George Floyd. Floyd was killed one week ago as a Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck for nine minutes. While the city of Albuquerque was sleeping, chaos erupted. Police in riot gear were tasked with keeping the peace. The Albuquerque Police Department is urging the public to avoid the downtown area at this time especially the area between Copper and Silver and 1st Street and 8th Street. New video shows the violent protests that broke out just after midnight Monday along Central. Protesters started fires in the middle of Central and 3rd Street and even smashed out the windows of nearby businesses. Officers on horseback arrived just after 1 a.m. Even more officers in riot gear held the line, and were blocking off nearby streets. At one point, officers in one area threw what appeared to be canisters emitting some kinds of smoke in the direction of protesters disobeying commands to leave the area. Protesters started to move in as did the officers where the two groups clashed on the streets getting very physical as the tear gas dispersed.

WASHINGTON — Joe Biden’s search for a running mate could be reshaped by the police killing of George Floyd and the unrest it has ignited across the country, raising questions about contenders with law-and-order backgrounds and intensifying pressure on the presumptive Democratic nominee to select a black woman. Biden, who has already pledged to pick a woman, has cast a wide net in his search. Some of the women on his list have drawn national praise amid the protests over Floyd’s death, including Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, who delivered an impassioned appeal for calm in her city on Friday night. But the outcry over police brutality against minorities has complicated the prospects of Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who had a controversial record addressing police violence as a prosecutor in the city where Floyd died. Biden’s choice of a running mate will be among the most consequential decisions he makes in the campaign, particularly given that the 77-year-old is already talking about himself as a “transition” candidate to a new generation of Democratic leaders. His pick will also be viewed as a signal both of his values and who he believes should have representation at the highest level of the American government. ADVERTISEMENTSkip ................................................................ Even before the outcry over Floyd’s death, some Biden allies were already urging him to put a black woman on the ticket given the critical role African Americans played in his path to the Democratic nomination. Those calls have gotten louder in recent days. “The more we see this level of hatred, the more I think it’s important to confront it with symbolic acts, including potentially the selection of an African American woman as vice president,” said Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers and one of the labor leaders who’s been asked for input by Biden’s team on the selection process. Biden was pressed to pick a black woman on Monday when he visited a black church in Wilmington, Delaware. “A black female will overwhelm and excite and turn the heads of these young people and everybody out there,” an attendee told Biden, referring to those demonstrating in the streets. Beyond Bottoms, Biden is believed to be considering California Sen. Kamala Harris, Florida Rep. Val Demings and Stacey Abrams, the Georgia Democrat and voting rights activist. In an interview Sunday with The Associated Press, Demings didn’t answer directly when asked if the events of the past week increased pressure on Biden to choose a black woman. “Well, we’ve never seen a black woman selected as a vice presidential candidate,” she said. “But I think the American people want someone who cares about their issues and are willing to move the ball forward.” Politicians with law-and-order backgrounds have been viewed skeptically by some in the Democratic Party given the high-profile instances of police brutality against minorities and other inequities in the criminal justice system. ADVERTISEMENTSkip ................................................................ Demings, a former Orlando police chief, defended herself and other potential contenders with such backgrounds, declaring “you’re either gonna be part of the problem or part of the solution.” “The community wants people who understand the system from the inside out in order to bring real life necessary reforms,” she said. Harris faced criticism throughout her Democratic primary campaign for her record as a prosecutor and attorney general in California, when she resisted reforms that would have required her office to investigate killings by police and established statewide standards for body cameras. Former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid suggested a resume as a prosecutor could be problematic for potential contenders. “Prosecutors are not very popular, especially among young people now,” he said. “I’ve got a granddaughter who is graduating from law school and she wants to be a public defender. She doesn’t want to be a prosecutor. And I think a lot of younger people feel the same.” Klobuchar, who also sought the Democratic nomination, has faced questions about her eight years as prosecutor for Minnesota’s largest county during the primary. Most of the more than two dozen people who died during police encounters in her tenure were people of color, according to data compiled by Communities United Against Police Brutality and news articles reviewed by the AP. An officer involved in one of those past fatal incidents was Derek Chauvin, who was arrested and charged Friday with Floyd’s murder. Since ending her campaign, Klobuchar has emerged as a key Biden surrogate and some Democrats see her as a running mate who could help him appeal to some of the white, working-class voters who turned against the party in the 2016 election. Yet some Democrats say the renewed focus on police brutality could complicate her path. ADVERTISEMENTSkip ................................................................ “This is very tough timing for her,” said Rep. James Clyburn, D-S.C., a top Biden ally. Klobuchar has said that she is confident Biden will make the right choice and that she’s not thinking about politics right now. Biden has said he will announce a running mate by Aug. 1, a timeline that leaves plenty of time for the national mood to shift again, particularly as the coronavirus pandemic and resulting economic collapse pressed on. Biden’s search process is still in a relatively early phase. A search committee has been meeting with power players on the left, with special attention to Democratic leaders on Capitol Hill and across organized labor. Biden, who has largely been cloistered at his home in Delaware during the pandemic, would also like to conduct in person meetings with finalists. “It’s important for him to see the candidate, talk to the candidate, get body language from the candidate. And I don’t mean one time. I think it needs to be several times,” said Cedric Richmond, a Louisiana congressman and campaign co-chair. __ Barrow reported from Atlanta.

Protesters gathered to protest the killing of al-Halak in Jerusalem and the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis last week. (AP Photo/Oded Balilty) WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. officials are seeking to determine whether extremist groups had infiltrated police brutality protests across the country and deliberately tipped largely peaceful demonstrations toward violence — and if foreign adversaries were behind a burgeoning disinformation campaign on social media. As demonstrations spread from Minneapolis to the White House, New York City and overseas Sunday, federal law enforcement officials insisted far-left groups were stoking violence. Meanwhile, experts who track extremist groups also reported seeing evidence of the far-right at work. Investigators were also tracking online interference and looking into whether foreign agents were behind the effort. Officials have seen a surge of social media accounts with fewer than 200 followers created in the last month, a textbook sign of a disinformation effort. The accounts have posted graphic images of the protests, material on police brutality and material on the coronavirus pandemic that appeared designed to inflame tensions across the political divide, according to three administration officials. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss investigations. The investigations are an attempt to identify the network of forces behind some of the most widespread outbreaks of civil unrest in the U.S. in decades. Protests erupted in dozens of cities in recent days, triggered by the death of George Floyd, who died after he was pinned at the neck by a white Minneapolis police officer’s knee. Pandemic-weary Americans were already angry — about COVID-19 deaths, lockdown orders and tens of millions of people out of work. The pandemic has hit African Americans harder than whites in the U.S., and the killings of black people by police have continued over the years even as the topic faded from the national stage. But there are signs of people with other disparate motives, including anarchist graffiti, arrests of some out-of-state protesters, and images circulating in extremist groups that suggest the involvement of outside groups. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said Sunday that state authorities were hit with a cyber attack as law enforcement prepared to diffuse protests in Minneapolis and St. Paul, the epicenter of the unrest. He described it as a “very sophisticated denial of service attack on all computers.” President Donald Trump, Attorney General William Bar and others have said the left-wing extremist group antifa is to blame. Short for anti-fascists, antifa is an umbrella term for far-left-leaning militant groups that resist neo-Nazis and white supremacists at demonstrations. Barr on Sunday said the FBI would use its regional joint terrorism task forces to “identify criminal organizers,” and Trump threatened again to name antifa a terrorist group. The Justice Department is also deploying members of the U.S. Marshals Service and agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration on Sunday to supplement National Guard troops outside the White House, a senior department official said. The official was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. The addition of the federal agents, who will have armored vehicles, came as Barr warned that prosecutors could seek to use terrorism statutes against “violent radical agitators” who attempt to hijack protests to cause destruction. An antifa activist group disseminated a message in a Telegram channel on Saturday that encouraged people to consider Minnesota National Guard troops “easy targets,” two Defense Department officials said. The message encouraged activists to steal “kit,” meaning the weapons and body armor used by the soldiers. The officials were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. As a result, soldiers with the Minnesota National Guard were armed during their mission at protests across the state Sunday, the officials said. The soldiers are sometimes armed but had not been since they moved into parts of the state that had been besieged by riots in the last few days. The troops do not have the authority to make arrests, and are there to act mostly as extra security for police. Others have seen evidence of right-wing extremists. J.J. MacNab, a fellow at George Washington University’s Program on Extremism, has been monitoring chatter about the protests among anti-government extremists on social media platforms. She has access to dozens of private Facebook groups for followers of the loosely organized “Boogaloo” movement, which uses an ’80s movie sequel as a code word for a second civil war. She also has been poring over images from the weekend protests and spotted some “boogaloo bois” in the crowds, carrying high-powered rifles and wearing tactical gear. “They want to co-opt them in order to start their war. They see themselves as being on the side of protesters and that the protesters themselves are useful in causing anarchy,” MacNab said. She also sees signs that the Three Percenters militia movement appears to be taking an interest. Megan Squire, an Elon University computer science professor who tracks online extremism, saw images of at least four members of the far-right Proud Boys group on the periphery of a protest Saturday night in Raleigh, North Carolina. Trump was expected in the coming days to draw distinctions between the legitimate anger of peaceful protesters and the unacceptable actions of violent agitators, said a White House official who was not authorized to discuss the plans ahead of time and spoke on condition of anonymity. The Trump administration has largely remained silent on local reports that far-right protesters were also involved. Meanwhile, Democratic mayors said Trump’s handling of the crisis was reminiscent of one of the darkest moments of his presidency — when he said there were “good people on both sides” of protests in 2017 over white supremacists demonstrating in Charlottesville, Virginia. America’s racial fault lines are a perfect opportunity for foreign adversaries looking to sow discord and portray the U.S. in a negative light, according to James Ludes, director of the Pell Center for International Relations and Public Policy at Salve Regina University in Rhode Island. “This is a real issue and Americans are legitimately upset about it,” said Ludes, who studies foreign disinformation tactics. “That’s one of the hallmarks of these campaigns. You don’t create new issues, you exploit existing issues.” There’s a history of this. In 2016, another black man, Philando Castile, was killed by police in a Minneapolis suburb, his death livestreamed on Facebook. Russians used a fake Black Lives Matter page to confuse and stoke anger among the protesters. There were nearly 700,000 followers, but it’s not clear how many were real. One debunked example from this week: That Atlanta had deployed a “child militia.” Floyd was accused of trying to pass a bad bill at a grocery store after he was laid off in the pandemic. Disturbing video showed him prone on the street, while a white police officer pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck even as he cried he couldn’t breathe. He later died. The officers have been fired; Derek Chauvin, the officer who pinned Floyd in the video, was charged with murder. At first there were peaceful demonstrations, but violence soon erupted. A Minneapolis police station was torched and protests took off around the country, growing increasingly tense. Video showed a police vehicle ramming into demonstrators in New York. Meanwhile, a van with four New York Police Department officers inside was hit with a Molotov cocktail and torched. Hundreds have been arrested nationwide and cities braced for more protests. But booking information from the county jail in Minneapolis, for example, showed that out of 59 protest-related arrests, 47 people had a home address in Minnesota, with the majority coming from the Twin Cities. Before protests began in New York City, organizers of anarchist groups began raising money for bail, recruited medical teams to deploy for violent interactions with police and planned how to target high-end stores, said John Miller, the NYPD’s deputy commissioner of intelligence and counterterrorism. Scouts on bicycles would also move ahead of the groups to report where the police would be and then direct small breakaway groups to areas where they could torch police cars or throw Molotov cocktails, Miller said. The NYPD has arrested 786 people related to protests since May 28 and 1 in 7 of them were not from New York City, he said. In Washington, where protesters raged outside the White House, most of the 17 people arrested were from the area. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser said the groups seemed, at the least, organized to destroy with tools to break windows and distribute materials. ___ Associated Press writers Kathleen Hennessey in Minneapolis; Michael Kunzelman in Silver Spring, Md.; Michael R.

Floyd, who after a white police officer who is now charged with murder, Derek Chauvin, pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck for several minutes even after he stopped moving and pleading for air. (Dean Purcell/New Zealand Herald via AP DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Standing at a lectern with a backdrop map of the world behind him reminiscent of one at the State Department, the spokesman of Iran’s Foreign Ministry made a point Monday to criticize the U.S. in English amid ongoing protests over police killings of black people. “To the American people, the world has … heard your outcry over this state oppression,” Abbas Mousavi told reporters in Tehran. So too have Washington’s adversaries in Iran and elsewhere. Long the target of American criticism, these nations have used the protests over the killing of George Floyd as an opportunity to hit back at the country held up by U.S. leaders for decades as “the shining city upon a hill.” By putting forth images of the unrest, they portray the U.S. as a hypocritical superpower unable to secure its own people, as well as normalizing the violence and repression they visit on their own citizens. “To be clear, though they are trying to sympathize with protesters in the U.S., their aim is to leverage the internal divisions in America, … not to advance the debate on this,” said Ariane Tabatabai, a Middle East fellow who studies Iran at the Washington-based German Marshall Fund. “Regime officials particularly like the theme of racial tensions in the U.S. because it allows them to point the finger at Washington, which is often front and center condemning human rights abuses by the regime,” she said. That’s particularly valuable to Iran, which has violently put down recent nationwide economic demonstrations by killing hundreds, arresting thousands and disrupting internet access. The Islamic Republic has seen its already-ailing economy crater since President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew Washington from Tehran’s nuclear deal with world powers, cutting off its oil sales. “The American regime is pursuing violence and bullying at home and abroad,” Mousavi said. That criticism has extended to Twitter, which Iranian officials use extensively despite the website being banned since the mass protests and crackdown surrounding its disputed 2009 presidential election. Former hard-line President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, whose disputed re-election sparked the 2009 unrest, called Floyd’s killing “disturbing & upsetting.” Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif offered a rewritten statement earlier issued by U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, crossing out Iran and replacing it with America. Pompeo responded by tweeting: “You hang homosexuals, stone women and exterminate Jews.” State-controlled media in China saw the protests through the prism of American views on Hong Kong’s anti-government demonstrations, which China has long said the U.S. encouraged. In a commentary, the ruling Communist Party newspaper Global Times said Chinese experts had noted that U.S. politicians might think twice before commenting again on Hong Kong, knowing “their words might backfire.” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian offered his own criticism at a Beijing news conference. The protests “once again reflect the racial discrimination in the U.S., the serious problems of police violent enforcement and the urgency of solving these problems,” Zhao said. He added that China hopes the U.S. will “safeguard and guarantee the legal rights of ethnic minorities.” That’s as China continues a yearslong, massive crackdown that has locked away more than 1 million ethnic minorities, most of them Muslims. In North Korea, the country’s official Rodong Sinmun newspaper reported about the demonstrations, saying that protesters “harshly condemned” a white policeman’s “lawless and brutal murder” of a black citizen. Three large photos showed protests from recent days from Minneapolis, where Floyd died May 25 after a white police officer pressed his knee on Floyd’s neck for several minutes. The officer was fired and charged with murder, but protesters are demanding the three other officers at the scene be prosecuted. Rodong Sinmun noted hundreds of protesters gathered in front of the White House chanting, “No justice, no peace.” It did not make any direct comments about Trump, whom North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has met three times in high-profile summits. Russia said the United States had systemic human rights problems, criticism that followed a pattern dating to the Cold War. The 1957 integration of Little Rock Central High School by nine African American students supported by bayonet-carrying soldiers of the 101st Airborne Division saw one Soviet newspaper use the headline: “Troops Advance Against Children!” That information warfare continues today in the cyber-realm, as U.S. intelligence agencies say Russia meddled America’s 2016 presidential election. Tabatabai said she and her colleagues had been tracking Chinese, Iranian and Russian social media accounts using the hashtags #BlackLivesMatter and #GeorgeFloyd. U.S. allies as well have been expressing their own opinions on the unrest. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s spokesman said the arrests and assaults on journalists were “very concerning.” Zimbabwe summoned the U.S. ambassador over U.S. national security adviser Robert O’Brien’s allegation this weekend that Harare could be one of several foreign adversaries taking advantage of the demonstrations. Meanwhile, Germany’s center-left Social Democratic Party, which is a member of Chancellor Angela Merkel’s governing coalition, on Monday described itself as “157 (years old) and Antifa. Naturally.” The tweet appeared to be a response to Trump’s assertion that he would designate Antifa, an umbrella description for the far-left-leaning militant groups that resist neo-Nazis and white supremacists at demonstrations and other events, “a terrorist organization.” Across from the U.S. Embassy in Paris, dozens of people knelt in silent protest, urging the French government to take racism and police violence more seriously. Despite a ban on gatherings of more than 10 people because of the coronavirus, they held signs reading “I Can’t Breathe” in English, or “Racism is suffocating us” and “We are all George Floyd” in French. Thousands of people packed Dam Square in central Amsterdam and spilled into several side streets in an unexpectedly large protest to denounce police brutality in the U.S. and Europe. They chanted “Black lives matter!” raising their fists and holding anti-racism signs. In Perth, Australia, the hundreds of demonstrators who peacefully protested Floyd’s death also sought to highlight injustices against indigenous Australians. “I believe it’s important as a young indigenous woman to vocalise that this isn’t just an American issue, this is a black people issue and indigenous people fit into that category,” organizer Tanesha Bennell told Nine Network television. Protesters carried banners with messages including “No Pride in Genocide” and tears appeared as the names of indigenous people who have died in Australian police custody were read to the crowd. ___ Associated Press writers Ken Moritsugu in Beijing, Kim Tong-hyung in Seoul, South Korea, Frank Jordans in Berlin, Jill Lawless in London, Farai Mutsaka in Harare, Zimbabwe, and Colleen Berry in Milan contributed. ___ Follow the AP’s latest news about the protests in the U.S. at https://apnews.com/GeorgeFloyd",0.0

Protests were held throughout the city over the death of George Floyd, a black man in police custody in Minneapolis who died after being restrained by police officers on Memorial Day. (AP Photo/Wong Maye-E) WASHINGTON (AP) — Wielding extraordinary federal authority, President Donald Trump threatened the nation’s governors on Monday that he would deploy the military to states if they did not stamp out violent protests over police brutality that have roiled the nation over the past week. His announcement came as police under federal command forced back peaceful demonstrators with tear gas so he could walk to a nearby church and pose with a Bible. Trump’s bellicose rhetoric came as the nation convulsed through another round of violence over the death of George Floyd at a time when the country is already buckling under the coronavirus outbreak and the Depression-level unemployment it has caused. The president demanded an end to the heated protests in remarks from the White House Rose Garden and vowed to use more force to achieve that aim. If governors throughout the country do not deploy the National Guard in sufficient numbers to “dominate the streets,” Trump said the U.S. military would step in to “quickly solve the problem for them.” “We have the greatest country in the world,” the president declared. “We’re going to keep it safe.” A military deployment by Trump to U.S. states would mark a stunning federal intervention rarely seen in modern American history. Yet the message Trump appeared to be sending with the brazen pushback of protesters outside the White House was that he sees few limits to what he is willing to do. Some around the president likened the moment to 1968, when Richard Nixon ran as the law-and-order candidate in the aftermath of a summer of riots, capturing the White House. But despite his efforts to portray himself as a political outsider, Trump is an incumbent who risks being held responsible for the violence. Minutes before Trump began speaking, police and National Guard soldiers began aggressively forcing back hundreds of peaceful protesters who had gathered in Lafayette Park, across the street from the White House, where they were chanting against police brutality and Floyd’s death in Minneapolis. As Trump spoke, tear gas canisters could be heard exploding. Floyd died last week after he was pinned to the pavement by a police officer who put his knee on the handcuffed black man’s neck until he stopped breathing. His death set off protests that spread from Minneapolis across America. His brother Terrence pleaded with protesters on Monday to remain peaceful. Five months before Election Day, the president made clear that he would stake his reelection efforts on convincing voters that his strong-arm approach was warranted to quell the most intense civil unrest since the 1960s. He made little effort to address the grievances of black Americans and others outraged by Floyd’s death and the scourge of police brutality, undermining what his campaign had hoped would be increased appeal to African American voters. The scene in and around the White House on Monday night appeared to be carefully orchestrated. As the crowd of protesters grew, Attorney General William Barr arrived in Lafayette Park to look over at the demonstrations and the swarm of law enforcement. The sudden shift in tactics against the protesters was initially a mystery. Then, after finishing his Rose Garden remarks, Trump emerged from the White House gates and walked through the park to St. John’s Church, where an office had been set on fire the previous night. Trump, who rarely attends church, held up a Bible and gathered a group of advisers — all white — to pose for photos. The moment was quickly decried by Trump’s critics, with New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo saying the president “used the military to push out a peaceful protest so he could have a photo op at a church.” “It’s all just a reality TV show for this president,” he said on Twitter. “Shameful.” Federal law permits presidents to dispatch the military into states to suppress an insurrection or if a state is defying federal law, legal experts said. But Trump’s statements also set up an immediate conflict with officials in New York and other states who asserted that the president does not have the unilateral right to send in troops against the will of local governments. The country has been beset by angry demonstrations for the past week in some of the most widespread racial unrest in the U.S. since the 1960s. Spurred largely by Floyd’s death, protesters have taken to the streets to decry the killings of black people by police. Minneapolis Officer Derek Chauvin has been charged with murder, but protesters are demanding that three of his colleagues be prosecuted, too. All four were fired. While most of the demonstrations have been peaceful, others have descended into violence, leaving neighborhoods in shambles, stores ransacked, windows broken and cars burned, despite curfews around the country and the deployment of thousands of National Guard members in at least 15 states. On Monday, demonstrations erupted from Philadelphia, where hundreds of protesters spilled onto a highway in the heart of the city, to Atlanta, where police fired tear gas at demonstrators, to Nashville, where more than 60 National Guard soldiers put down their riot shields at the request of peaceful protesters who had gathered in front of Tennessee’s state Capitol to honor Floyd. Two people were killed during protests in the Chicago suburb of Cicero, authorities said, but provided no details. In Louisville, Kentucky, riot police firing tear gas scattered several hundred protesters from downtown, violently capping a day of mostly peaceful protests. A vehicle plowed through a group of law enforcement officers at a demonstration in Buffalo, New York, injuring at least two. Video from the scene showed the vehicle accelerating through an intersection shortly after officers apparently tackled a protester and handcuffed him. The officers were hospitalized in stable condition, authorities said. In New York City, where nightfall has brought widespread scenes of destruction, large crowds rallied peacefully in Times Square and Brooklyn during the day. Then, in early evening, looters rushed into a Nike store in Manhattan and protesters smashed storefront windows near Rockefeller Center. Video posted on social media showed some protesters arguing with people breaking windows, urging them to stop. The city has already endured immense commercial damage from the unrest. On Monday, rioters got through the doors of the city’s flagship Macy’s store, famous for its Thanksgiving Day parade, and police later pulled at least two handcuffed men out of the store and put them into a van. By that time, most of the the street was littered with broken glass. In Washington, protesters continued marching peacefully through Washington hours after being forced from Lafayette park and past the 7 p.m. curfew. Eventually, within sight of the Capitol building, the marchers were turned back by law enforcement officers using tear gas, pellets and low-flying helicopters kicking up debris. As they dispersed, some protesters smashed windows at a nearby office building. Earlier Monday, Trump told the nation’s governors in a video conference that they “look like fools” for not deploying even more National Guard troops. “Most of you are weak,” he said. He added: “You’ve got to arrest people, you have to track people, you have to put them in jail for 10 years and you’ll never see this stuff again.” Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, a Democrat, dismissed Trump’s comments as the “rantings of an insecure man trying to look strong after building his entire political career on racism.” Former Vice President Joe Biden, the Democratic presidential candidate, vowed to address institutional racism in his first 100 days in office. He met in person with black leaders in Delaware and also held a virtual meeting with big-city mayors. Biden said hate emerges “when you have somebody in power who breathes oxygen into the hate.” In Minneapolis, meanwhile, Floyd’s brother Terrence made an emotional plea for peace at the site where Floyd was arrested. “Let’s switch it up, y’all. Let’s switch it up. Do this peacefully, please,” Terrence Floyd said as he urged people to use their power at the ballot box. Also Monday, an autopsy commissioned for Floyd’s family found that he died of asphyxiation from neck and back compression, the family’s attorneys said. Authorities in many cities have blamed the violence on outside agitators, though have provided little evidence to back that up. But on Monday, federal authorities arrested a 28-year-old Illinois man saying he had posted self-recorded video on his Facebook page last week that showed him in Minneapolis handing out explosive devices and encouraging people to throw them at law enforcement officers. More than 5,600 people nationwide have been arrested over the past week for such offenses as stealing, blocking highways and breaking curfew, according to a count by The Associated Press. ___ Sullivan and Morrison reported from Minneapolis.

Hundreds of people were at a Black Lives Matter demonstration Sunday in Bryan, Texas, including Quincy Mason Floyd, one of George Floyd’s sons. “I’m really excited about all this,” Floyd said. “Everyone is coming out and showing him love. I love this. My heart is really touched by all this.” Floyd and his sister, Connie Mason Floyd, moved from Houston to Bryan with their mother more than 15 years ago. Floyd said he was a young child, about 4 or 5 years old, when he last saw his father. It wasn’t until after Memorial Day when news of George Floyd’s death in police custody in Minneapolis made it to his son. “I didn’t recognize who it was until Mom called and told me,” he said. “She said, ‘Do you know who that guy was?’ I said no. she said, ‘That’s your father.'” Floyd said people in Bryan have been surprised to learn about the local connection to this international story. He said some people at first questioned it. “They kept asking, ‘Do you have any proof?’ and I said ‘Yeah, look at my face and look at his face,'” he said. “You can tell.” Both Floyd and his sister praised local protesters for hosting peaceful demonstrations and denounced the violence that has unfolded in other cities. “The violence is not the right way to do it,” Connie Mason Floyd said. “Now, this is beautiful, but the violence, it won’t solve nothing.” “Tearing up things, it’s not going to solve anything,” Floyd said. “My dad is in peace and we have to be the ones to deal with all this stress. It’s going to be tough to get over this day by day.” The two plan to be in Houston on Monday to visit with other members of the extended family and hope to have news to share soon about funeral arrangements for Floyd, who will be buried in the Houston area.",0.0

Protesters gathered to protest the killing of al-Halak in Jerusalem and the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis last week. (AP Photo/Oded Balilty) WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. officials are seeking to determine whether extremist groups had infiltrated police brutality protests across the country and deliberately tipped largely peaceful demonstrations toward violence — and if foreign adversaries were behind a burgeoning disinformation campaign on social media. As demonstrations spread from Minneapolis to the White House, New York City and overseas Sunday, federal law enforcement officials insisted far-left groups were stoking violence. Meanwhile, experts who track extremist groups also reported seeing evidence of the far-right at work. Investigators were also tracking online interference and looking into whether foreign agents were behind the effort. Officials have seen a surge of social media accounts with fewer than 200 followers created in the last month, a textbook sign of a disinformation effort. The accounts have posted graphic images of the protests, material on police brutality and material on the coronavirus pandemic that appeared designed to inflame tensions across the political divide, according to three administration officials. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss investigations. The investigations are an attempt to identify the network of forces behind some of the most widespread outbreaks of civil unrest in the U.S. in decades. Protests erupted in dozens of cities in recent days, triggered by the death of George Floyd, who died after he was pinned at the neck by a white Minneapolis police officer’s knee. Pandemic-weary Americans were already angry — about COVID-19 deaths, lockdown orders and tens of millions of people out of work. The pandemic has hit African Americans harder than whites in the U.S., and the killings of black people by police have continued over the years even as the topic faded from the national stage. But there are signs of people with other disparate motives, including anarchist graffiti, arrests of some out-of-state protesters, and images circulating in extremist groups that suggest the involvement of outside groups. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said Sunday that state authorities were hit with a cyber attack as law enforcement prepared to diffuse protests in Minneapolis and St. Paul, the epicenter of the unrest. He described it as a “very sophisticated denial of service attack on all computers.” President Donald Trump, Attorney General William Bar and others have said the left-wing extremist group antifa is to blame. Short for anti-fascists, antifa is an umbrella term for far-left-leaning militant groups that resist neo-Nazis and white supremacists at demonstrations. Barr on Sunday said the FBI would use its regional joint terrorism task forces to “identify criminal organizers,” and Trump threatened again to name antifa a terrorist group. The Justice Department is also deploying members of the U.S. Marshals Service and agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration on Sunday to supplement National Guard troops outside the White House, a senior department official said. The official was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. The addition of the federal agents, who will have armored vehicles, came as Barr warned that prosecutors could seek to use terrorism statutes against “violent radical agitators” who attempt to hijack protests to cause destruction. An antifa activist group disseminated a message in a Telegram channel on Saturday that encouraged people to consider Minnesota National Guard troops “easy targets,” two Defense Department officials said. The message encouraged activists to steal “kit,” meaning the weapons and body armor used by the soldiers. The officials were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. As a result, soldiers with the Minnesota National Guard were armed during their mission at protests across the state Sunday, the officials said. The soldiers are sometimes armed but had not been since they moved into parts of the state that had been besieged by riots in the last few days. The troops do not have the authority to make arrests, and are there to act mostly as extra security for police. Others have seen evidence of right-wing extremists. J.J. MacNab, a fellow at George Washington University’s Program on Extremism, has been monitoring chatter about the protests among anti-government extremists on social media platforms. She has access to dozens of private Facebook groups for followers of the loosely organized “Boogaloo” movement, which uses an ’80s movie sequel as a code word for a second civil war. She also has been poring over images from the weekend protests and spotted some “boogaloo bois” in the crowds, carrying high-powered rifles and wearing tactical gear. “They want to co-opt them in order to start their war. They see themselves as being on the side of protesters and that the protesters themselves are useful in causing anarchy,” MacNab said. She also sees signs that the Three Percenters militia movement appears to be taking an interest. Megan Squire, an Elon University computer science professor who tracks online extremism, saw images of at least four members of the far-right Proud Boys group on the periphery of a protest Saturday night in Raleigh, North Carolina. Trump was expected in the coming days to draw distinctions between the legitimate anger of peaceful protesters and the unacceptable actions of violent agitators, said a White House official who was not authorized to discuss the plans ahead of time and spoke on condition of anonymity. The Trump administration has largely remained silent on local reports that far-right protesters were also involved. Meanwhile, Democratic mayors said Trump’s handling of the crisis was reminiscent of one of the darkest moments of his presidency — when he said there were “good people on both sides” of protests in 2017 over white supremacists demonstrating in Charlottesville, Virginia. America’s racial fault lines are a perfect opportunity for foreign adversaries looking to sow discord and portray the U.S. in a negative light, according to James Ludes, director of the Pell Center for International Relations and Public Policy at Salve Regina University in Rhode Island. “This is a real issue and Americans are legitimately upset about it,” said Ludes, who studies foreign disinformation tactics. “That’s one of the hallmarks of these campaigns. You don’t create new issues, you exploit existing issues.” There’s a history of this. In 2016, another black man, Philando Castile, was killed by police in a Minneapolis suburb, his death livestreamed on Facebook. Russians used a fake Black Lives Matter page to confuse and stoke anger among the protesters. There were nearly 700,000 followers, but it’s not clear how many were real. One debunked example from this week: That Atlanta had deployed a “child militia.” Floyd was accused of trying to pass a bad bill at a grocery store after he was laid off in the pandemic. Disturbing video showed him prone on the street, while a white police officer pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck even as he cried he couldn’t breathe. He later died. The officers have been fired; Derek Chauvin, the officer who pinned Floyd in the video, was charged with murder. At first there were peaceful demonstrations, but violence soon erupted. A Minneapolis police station was torched and protests took off around the country, growing increasingly tense. Video showed a police vehicle ramming into demonstrators in New York. Meanwhile, a van with four New York Police Department officers inside was hit with a Molotov cocktail and torched. Hundreds have been arrested nationwide and cities braced for more protests. But booking information from the county jail in Minneapolis, for example, showed that out of 59 protest-related arrests, 47 people had a home address in Minnesota, with the majority coming from the Twin Cities. Before protests began in New York City, organizers of anarchist groups began raising money for bail, recruited medical teams to deploy for violent interactions with police and planned how to target high-end stores, said John Miller, the NYPD’s deputy commissioner of intelligence and counterterrorism. Scouts on bicycles would also move ahead of the groups to report where the police would be and then direct small breakaway groups to areas where they could torch police cars or throw Molotov cocktails, Miller said. The NYPD has arrested 786 people related to protests since May 28 and 1 in 7 of them were not from New York City, he said. In Washington, where protesters raged outside the White House, most of the 17 people arrested were from the area. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser said the groups seemed, at the least, organized to destroy with tools to break windows and distribute materials. ___ Associated Press writers Kathleen Hennessey in Minneapolis; Michael Kunzelman in Silver Spring, Md.; Michael R.

Floyd, who after a white police officer who is now charged with murder, Derek Chauvin, pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck for several minutes even after he stopped moving and pleading for air. (Dean Purcell/New Zealand Herald via AP DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Standing at a lectern with a backdrop map of the world behind him reminiscent of one at the State Department, the spokesman of Iran’s Foreign Ministry made a point Monday to criticize the U.S. in English amid ongoing protests over police killings of black people. “To the American people, the world has … heard your outcry over this state oppression,” Abbas Mousavi told reporters in Tehran. So too have Washington’s adversaries in Iran and elsewhere. Long the target of American criticism, these nations have used the protests over the killing of George Floyd as an opportunity to hit back at the country held up by U.S. leaders for decades as “the shining city upon a hill.” By putting forth images of the unrest, they portray the U.S. as a hypocritical superpower unable to secure its own people, as well as normalizing the violence and repression they visit on their own citizens. “To be clear, though they are trying to sympathize with protesters in the U.S., their aim is to leverage the internal divisions in America, … not to advance the debate on this,” said Ariane Tabatabai, a Middle East fellow who studies Iran at the Washington-based German Marshall Fund. “Regime officials particularly like the theme of racial tensions in the U.S. because it allows them to point the finger at Washington, which is often front and center condemning human rights abuses by the regime,” she said. That’s particularly valuable to Iran, which has violently put down recent nationwide economic demonstrations by killing hundreds, arresting thousands and disrupting internet access. The Islamic Republic has seen its already-ailing economy crater since President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew Washington from Tehran’s nuclear deal with world powers, cutting off its oil sales. “The American regime is pursuing violence and bullying at home and abroad,” Mousavi said. That criticism has extended to Twitter, which Iranian officials use extensively despite the website being banned since the mass protests and crackdown surrounding its disputed 2009 presidential election. Former hard-line President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, whose disputed re-election sparked the 2009 unrest, called Floyd’s killing “disturbing & upsetting.” Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif offered a rewritten statement earlier issued by U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, crossing out Iran and replacing it with America. Pompeo responded by tweeting: “You hang homosexuals, stone women and exterminate Jews.” State-controlled media in China saw the protests through the prism of American views on Hong Kong’s anti-government demonstrations, which China has long said the U.S. encouraged. In a commentary, the ruling Communist Party newspaper Global Times said Chinese experts had noted that U.S. politicians might think twice before commenting again on Hong Kong, knowing “their words might backfire.” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian offered his own criticism at a Beijing news conference. The protests “once again reflect the racial discrimination in the U.S., the serious problems of police violent enforcement and the urgency of solving these problems,” Zhao said. He added that China hopes the U.S. will “safeguard and guarantee the legal rights of ethnic minorities.” That’s as China continues a yearslong, massive crackdown that has locked away more than 1 million ethnic minorities, most of them Muslims. In North Korea, the country’s official Rodong Sinmun newspaper reported about the demonstrations, saying that protesters “harshly condemned” a white policeman’s “lawless and brutal murder” of a black citizen. Three large photos showed protests from recent days from Minneapolis, where Floyd died May 25 after a white police officer pressed his knee on Floyd’s neck for several minutes. The officer was fired and charged with murder, but protesters are demanding the three other officers at the scene be prosecuted. Rodong Sinmun noted hundreds of protesters gathered in front of the White House chanting, “No justice, no peace.” It did not make any direct comments about Trump, whom North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has met three times in high-profile summits. Russia said the United States had systemic human rights problems, criticism that followed a pattern dating to the Cold War. The 1957 integration of Little Rock Central High School by nine African American students supported by bayonet-carrying soldiers of the 101st Airborne Division saw one Soviet newspaper use the headline: “Troops Advance Against Children!” That information warfare continues today in the cyber-realm, as U.S. intelligence agencies say Russia meddled America’s 2016 presidential election. Tabatabai said she and her colleagues had been tracking Chinese, Iranian and Russian social media accounts using the hashtags #BlackLivesMatter and #GeorgeFloyd. U.S. allies as well have been expressing their own opinions on the unrest. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s spokesman said the arrests and assaults on journalists were “very concerning.” Zimbabwe summoned the U.S. ambassador over U.S. national security adviser Robert O’Brien’s allegation this weekend that Harare could be one of several foreign adversaries taking advantage of the demonstrations. Meanwhile, Germany’s center-left Social Democratic Party, which is a member of Chancellor Angela Merkel’s governing coalition, on Monday described itself as “157 (years old) and Antifa. Naturally.” The tweet appeared to be a response to Trump’s assertion that he would designate Antifa, an umbrella description for the far-left-leaning militant groups that resist neo-Nazis and white supremacists at demonstrations and other events, “a terrorist organization.” Across from the U.S. Embassy in Paris, dozens of people knelt in silent protest, urging the French government to take racism and police violence more seriously. Despite a ban on gatherings of more than 10 people because of the coronavirus, they held signs reading “I Can’t Breathe” in English, or “Racism is suffocating us” and “We are all George Floyd” in French. Thousands of people packed Dam Square in central Amsterdam and spilled into several side streets in an unexpectedly large protest to denounce police brutality in the U.S. and Europe. They chanted “Black lives matter!” raising their fists and holding anti-racism signs. In Perth, Australia, the hundreds of demonstrators who peacefully protested Floyd’s death also sought to highlight injustices against indigenous Australians. “I believe it’s important as a young indigenous woman to vocalise that this isn’t just an American issue, this is a black people issue and indigenous people fit into that category,” organizer Tanesha Bennell told Nine Network television. Protesters carried banners with messages including “No Pride in Genocide” and tears appeared as the names of indigenous people who have died in Australian police custody were read to the crowd. ___ Associated Press writers Ken Moritsugu in Beijing, Kim Tong-hyung in Seoul, South Korea, Frank Jordans in Berlin, Jill Lawless in London, Farai Mutsaka in Harare, Zimbabwe, and Colleen Berry in Milan contributed. ___ Follow the AP’s latest news about the protests in the U.S. at https://apnews.com/GeorgeFloyd",0.0

Protests were held throughout the city over the death of George Floyd, a black man in police custody in Minneapolis who died after being restrained by police officers on Memorial Day. (AP Photo/Wong Maye-E) WASHINGTON (AP) — Wielding extraordinary federal authority, President Donald Trump threatened the nation’s governors on Monday that he would deploy the military to states if they did not stamp out violent protests over police brutality that have roiled the nation over the past week. His announcement came as police under federal command forced back peaceful demonstrators with tear gas so he could walk to a nearby church and pose with a Bible. Trump’s bellicose rhetoric came as the nation convulsed through another round of violence over the death of George Floyd at a time when the country is already buckling under the coronavirus outbreak and the Depression-level unemployment it has caused. The president demanded an end to the heated protests in remarks from the White House Rose Garden and vowed to use more force to achieve that aim. If governors throughout the country do not deploy the National Guard in sufficient numbers to “dominate the streets,” Trump said the U.S. military would step in to “quickly solve the problem for them.” “We have the greatest country in the world,” the president declared. “We’re going to keep it safe.” A military deployment by Trump to U.S. states would mark a stunning federal intervention rarely seen in modern American history. Yet the message Trump appeared to be sending with the brazen pushback of protesters outside the White House was that he sees few limits to what he is willing to do. Some around the president likened the moment to 1968, when Richard Nixon ran as the law-and-order candidate in the aftermath of a summer of riots, capturing the White House. But despite his efforts to portray himself as a political outsider, Trump is an incumbent who risks being held responsible for the violence. Minutes before Trump began speaking, police and National Guard soldiers began aggressively forcing back hundreds of peaceful protesters who had gathered in Lafayette Park, across the street from the White House, where they were chanting against police brutality and Floyd’s death in Minneapolis. As Trump spoke, tear gas canisters could be heard exploding. Floyd died last week after he was pinned to the pavement by a police officer who put his knee on the handcuffed black man’s neck until he stopped breathing. His death set off protests that spread from Minneapolis across America. His brother Terrence pleaded with protesters on Monday to remain peaceful. Five months before Election Day, the president made clear that he would stake his reelection efforts on convincing voters that his strong-arm approach was warranted to quell the most intense civil unrest since the 1960s. He made little effort to address the grievances of black Americans and others outraged by Floyd’s death and the scourge of police brutality, undermining what his campaign had hoped would be increased appeal to African American voters. The scene in and around the White House on Monday night appeared to be carefully orchestrated. As the crowd of protesters grew, Attorney General William Barr arrived in Lafayette Park to look over at the demonstrations and the swarm of law enforcement. The sudden shift in tactics against the protesters was initially a mystery. Then, after finishing his Rose Garden remarks, Trump emerged from the White House gates and walked through the park to St. John’s Church, where an office had been set on fire the previous night. Trump, who rarely attends church, held up a Bible and gathered a group of advisers — all white — to pose for photos. The moment was quickly decried by Trump’s critics, with New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo saying the president “used the military to push out a peaceful protest so he could have a photo op at a church.” “It’s all just a reality TV show for this president,” he said on Twitter. “Shameful.” Federal law permits presidents to dispatch the military into states to suppress an insurrection or if a state is defying federal law, legal experts said. But Trump’s statements also set up an immediate conflict with officials in New York and other states who asserted that the president does not have the unilateral right to send in troops against the will of local governments. The country has been beset by angry demonstrations for the past week in some of the most widespread racial unrest in the U.S. since the 1960s. Spurred largely by Floyd’s death, protesters have taken to the streets to decry the killings of black people by police. Minneapolis Officer Derek Chauvin has been charged with murder, but protesters are demanding that three of his colleagues be prosecuted, too. All four were fired. While most of the demonstrations have been peaceful, others have descended into violence, leaving neighborhoods in shambles, stores ransacked, windows broken and cars burned, despite curfews around the country and the deployment of thousands of National Guard members in at least 15 states. On Monday, demonstrations erupted from Philadelphia, where hundreds of protesters spilled onto a highway in the heart of the city, to Atlanta, where police fired tear gas at demonstrators, to Nashville, where more than 60 National Guard soldiers put down their riot shields at the request of peaceful protesters who had gathered in front of Tennessee’s state Capitol to honor Floyd. Two people were killed during protests in the Chicago suburb of Cicero, authorities said, but provided no details. In Louisville, Kentucky, riot police firing tear gas scattered several hundred protesters from downtown, violently capping a day of mostly peaceful protests. A vehicle plowed through a group of law enforcement officers at a demonstration in Buffalo, New York, injuring at least two. Video from the scene showed the vehicle accelerating through an intersection shortly after officers apparently tackled a protester and handcuffed him. The officers were hospitalized in stable condition, authorities said. In New York City, where nightfall has brought widespread scenes of destruction, large crowds rallied peacefully in Times Square and Brooklyn during the day. Then, in early evening, looters rushed into a Nike store in Manhattan and protesters smashed storefront windows near Rockefeller Center. Video posted on social media showed some protesters arguing with people breaking windows, urging them to stop. The city has already endured immense commercial damage from the unrest. On Monday, rioters got through the doors of the city’s flagship Macy’s store, famous for its Thanksgiving Day parade, and police later pulled at least two handcuffed men out of the store and put them into a van. By that time, most of the the street was littered with broken glass. In Washington, protesters continued marching peacefully through Washington hours after being forced from Lafayette park and past the 7 p.m. curfew. Eventually, within sight of the Capitol building, the marchers were turned back by law enforcement officers using tear gas, pellets and low-flying helicopters kicking up debris. As they dispersed, some protesters smashed windows at a nearby office building. Earlier Monday, Trump told the nation’s governors in a video conference that they “look like fools” for not deploying even more National Guard troops. “Most of you are weak,” he said. He added: “You’ve got to arrest people, you have to track people, you have to put them in jail for 10 years and you’ll never see this stuff again.” Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, a Democrat, dismissed Trump’s comments as the “rantings of an insecure man trying to look strong after building his entire political career on racism.” Former Vice President Joe Biden, the Democratic presidential candidate, vowed to address institutional racism in his first 100 days in office. He met in person with black leaders in Delaware and also held a virtual meeting with big-city mayors. Biden said hate emerges “when you have somebody in power who breathes oxygen into the hate.” In Minneapolis, meanwhile, Floyd’s brother Terrence made an emotional plea for peace at the site where Floyd was arrested. “Let’s switch it up, y’all. Let’s switch it up. Do this peacefully, please,” Terrence Floyd said as he urged people to use their power at the ballot box. Also Monday, an autopsy commissioned for Floyd’s family found that he died of asphyxiation from neck and back compression, the family’s attorneys said. Authorities in many cities have blamed the violence on outside agitators, though have provided little evidence to back that up. But on Monday, federal authorities arrested a 28-year-old Illinois man saying he had posted self-recorded video on his Facebook page last week that showed him in Minneapolis handing out explosive devices and encouraging people to throw them at law enforcement officers. More than 5,600 people nationwide have been arrested over the past week for such offenses as stealing, blocking highways and breaking curfew, according to a count by The Associated Press. ___ Sullivan and Morrison reported from Minneapolis.

Floyd said he was a young child, about 4 or 5 years old, when he last saw his father. It wasn’t until after Memorial Day when news of George Floyd’s death in police custody in Minneapolis made it to his son. “I didn’t recognize who it was until Mom called and told me,” he said. “She said, ‘Do you know who that guy was?’ I said no. she said, ‘That’s your father.'” Floyd said people in Bryan have been surprised to learn about the local connection to this international story. He said some people at first questioned it. “They kept asking, ‘Do you have any proof?’ and I said ‘Yeah, look at my face and look at his face,'” he said. “You can tell.” Both Floyd and his sister praised local protesters for hosting peaceful demonstrations and denounced the violence that has unfolded in other cities. “The violence is not the right way to do it,” Connie Mason Floyd said. “Now, this is beautiful, but the violence, it won’t solve nothing.” “Tearing up things, it’s not going to solve anything,” Floyd said. “My dad is in peace and we have to be the ones to deal with all this stress.

Organizers handed out bags of donated supplies to help participants feel safer demonstrating during the pandemic. Protesters gathered Sunday evening on the westside of the University of New Mexico campus on Central Ave. with signs that read, “Black Lives Matter” and “White silence is violence.” The group chanted, “say his name: George Floyd” and “no justice, no peace, no racist police.” Organizer Hossanna Scott fundraised online to provide protesters with baggies of supplies, including PPE, water and snacks. She raised over $4,000 from community donations. “Mobilizing and organizing during a pandemic is a whole new thing, it’s a whole new ballpark,” said Scott. “But I just wanted people to feel safe. That’s the reason I got these masks, hand sanitizer, gloves on deck. Because I just know it’ll be hard, for some people, but I just want people to show up.” People showed up. The group eventually grew to thousands, marching along Route 66 to Downtown Albuquerque, where they gathered on a roundabout on 8th St. by Robinson park for a moment of silence. Protesters then headed back up to the University of New Mexico area before marching to Albuquerque’s Civic Plaza, where speeches were given. Following that gathering, most protesters went home. Violence Breaks Out In Downtown ABQ After Peaceful Black Lives Matter Protest - Marisa Demarco, KUNM News After thousands of peaceful Black Lives Matter protesters dispersed, some people remained Downtown in Albuquerque, driving their cars, playing music on their systems and displaying anti-police violence signs.

At first, it was spiderwebbed windows on storefronts and graffiti. But around 12:30 in the morning at Third Street and Central, people smashed through some of those windows and started pulling things out of the businesses. Motorcycles and cars revved their engines. And businesses’ security alarms sounded. Looters pulled furniture from inside a club, sprayed fire extinguishers at the sky, lobbed glassware high into the air, and started a small fire in the street. Police helicopters circled. Riot police started forming, coming up Central, starting around 5th St. NW, telling everyone to leave. A helicopter above repeated the message through a loudspeaker. People threw things at police, and lit some dumpsters on fire, rolling them toward the line of riot officers, though none reached them. Another line of officers waited on 2nd St. NW. Police fired flash-bangs and rubber bullets, and launched tear gas, announcing they were going to take anyone who didn’t leave into custody. As of 5 a.m. Monday, helicopters are still circling, and tear gas is wafting out of Downtown. Navajo Nation Reports 98 New COVID-19 Cases, 5 More Deaths – Associated Press The Navajo Department of Health has reported 98 new cases of coronavirus on the Navajo Nation and five more known deaths. That pushes the numbers to 5,348 positive COVID-19 cases and 246 known deaths as of Sunday night. Tribal officials also say preliminary reports from eight health care facilities indicate about 1,840 people have recovered from COVID-19 with more reports still pending. The vast Navajo Nation reservation stretches into northeastern Arizona, northwestern New Mexico and southeastern Utah. For most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. But for some — especially older adults and people with existing health problems — it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia and death. Positive COVID-19 Cases Reaches 7,800 With First Inmate Death – KUNM New Mexico health officials reported six additional deaths related to COVID-19 Monday, including an inmate at the Otero County Prison Facility held by the New Mexico Corrections Department, the first COVID-related death of an inmate in state custody. The total number of deaths in the state is now 362 and there are 7,800 cases. Officials announced 113 additional positive tests Monday, over half of which were in northwest New Mexico. The Corrections Department said in a news release the 31-year-old male who died had multiple preexisting conditions. was hospitalized at the University Hospital in El Paso, Texas, where he tested positive for COVID-19. Corrections officials said the Otero County Prison Facility, which is operated by the Management and Training Corp., is working with the Department of Health to do rigorous testing, isolation and quarantine protocol in the center. There are 46 total positive cases among New Mexico Corrections inmates at the detention center and three people are hospitalized. New Mexico Utility Seeks To Decouple Electric Rates, Costs – Associated Press New Mexico's largest electric provider is asking state regulators to consider a proposal that would allow it to recover fixed service costs independent of how much electricity is actually consumed by customers. Public Service Co. of New Mexico is pointing to uncertainty amid the coronavirus as it pursues what is known as decoupling. The utility recently filed its request with the Public Regulation Commission after announcing its intensions to shareholders in May. If approved, the utility will tally how much customers paid for electricity throughout 2021 and then compare that with the annual revenue it is allowed to collect to cover its costs. Albuquerque Mayor Tim Keller is blaming small groups of what he called “agitators” for violence that broke out hours after a peaceful protest dispersed in downtown Albuquerque last night. Thousands participated in a peaceful Black Lives Matter protest in response to the killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police. Organizers raised $4,000 to distribute bags of supplies, including masks and hand sanitizer, to help demonstrators feel safe and reduce the spread of COVID. The crowds marched along Route 66 to a vigil at Robinson Park, back up to the UNM area and back downtown to Civic Plaza, and then most protesters left the area. Hours later, 100 or 200 people remained downtown and some started looting businesses, throwing glass and setting small fires. The Albuquerque Police Department says they were shot at outside the KiMo Theatre. Two lines of police riot teams approached and used rubber bullets and tear gas. No injuries have been reported, and Mayor Keller says two people were arrested on misdemeanor charges. Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham in a release today commended peaceful protesters and said in response to the rioting that “there is no place in this moment for hijacking the protesters’ message of justice and nonviolence.” She called President Trump’s remarks today urging aggressive protest response “a dangerous step in the wrong direction,” and said the state is committed to helping facilitate peaceful protests against racism.

New Mexico Has 69 New Coronavirus Cases, 5 More Known Deaths - Associated Press Health officials in New Mexico are reporting 69 new confirmed COVID-19 infections and five more related deaths. That brings the total confirmed infections to 7,689 and 356 known coronavirus deaths as of Sunday. There are 182 hospitalized patients. New Mexico Department of Health officials say four of the five deaths reported Sunday were in San Juan County with the other in McKinley County. McKinley County has 2,415 overall cases of COVID-19 with San Juan County at 1,733 cases and Bernalillo County, the state's most populous county, at 1,476 cases. Navajo Nation Reports 105 New Covid-19 Cases, 10 More Deaths - Associated Press The Navajo Department of Health has reported 105 new cases of coronavirus on the Navajo Nation and 10 more known deaths. That pushes the numbers to 5,250 positive COVID-19 cases and 241 known deaths as of Saturday night.

University Of The Southwest Waives Cost For Grad Programs - Hobbs News-Sun, Associated Press A southeastern New Mexico college has announced it will allow all of the school's recent undergraduates to begin master's degree programs tuition-free. The Hobbs News-Sun reports the University of the Southwest said last month the tuition-free experiment will start this summer. University President Quint Thurman says he and other administrators made the decision after exploring what the school could do to assist recent graduates when the job market is challenging. Eligible students must have completed their bachelor's degrees in 2020 at the private Christian university. New Mexico's Populous County Sees Jump In Illegal Dumping - KRQE-TV, Associated Press Officials in New Mexico's most populous county are reporting a rise in illegal dumping amid the COVID-19 pandemic. KRQE-TV reports that Bernalillo County officials believe the uptick in illegal dumping is a result of people cleaning out their homes during the stay-at-home order and failing to make trips to authorized dump sites. County officials say they have received double the number of calls for service connected to dumping from this time last year. The county reports having to pick up tires, mattresses, home appliances, cars and other big items. The county's health protection manager, Lucas Tafoya, says crews have to wait a couple of days before they clean up the reported messes in case there are traces of the novel coronavirus on the material. Illegal dumping comes with a fine of up to $1,000 or 90 days in jail. Fire At Albuquerque Assisted Living Facility Displaces 13 - Associated Press The Albuquerque fire department says 13 residents of an assisted living facility were displaced by a fire in one apartment Saturday morning. The department says firefighters were able to put out the fire without it extending into other areas of La Vida Llena. According to the department, one person was transported for injuries related to possible smoke inhalation and no firefighters were injured. No additional information was released. Advocates Question Investigations Used To Target Wolves - Associated Press An ongoing analysis by an environmental group is raising questions about investigations into livestock kills by Mexican gray wolves. The results of the investigations are used to compensate ranchers and target problem wolves in New Mexico and Arizona. The Idaho-based group Western Watersheds Project has documented significant oddities, errors or conflicting details in more than two-thirds of the 117 investigations it reviewed from 2019. The group's deputy director tells the Arizona Daily Star that numerous cases were confirmed wolf kills based just on ""logical leaps"" and what she described as a stunning lack of evidence. In March alone, government hunters killed four wolves in New Mexico under federal removal orders that cited repeated attacks on livestock in the area. The Mexican gray wolf was once common throughout portions of the Southwest and Mexico. By the 1970s, it had been hunted, trapped and poisoned to near-extinction. In 1998, state and federal wildlife managers began reintroducing the subspecies with the experimental release of 11 captive-bred wolves. There are now at least 163 wolves roaming the two states, according to the latest survey.",0.0

(KRQE) – Protests in Albuquerque turned violent overnight over the death of Minneapolis man George Floyd. Floyd was killed one week ago as a Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck for nine minutes. While the city of Albuquerque was sleeping, chaos erupted. Police in riot gear were tasked with keeping the peace. The Albuquerque Police Department is urging the public to avoid the downtown area at this time especially the area between Copper and Silver and 1st Street and 8th Street. New video shows the violent protests that broke out just after midnight Monday along Central. Protesters started fires in the middle of Central and 3rd Street and even smashed out the windows of nearby businesses. Officers on horseback arrived just after 1 a.m. Even more officers in riot gear held the line, and were blocking off nearby streets. At one point, officers in one area threw what appeared to be canisters emitting some kinds of smoke in the direction of protesters disobeying commands to leave the area. Protesters started to move in as did the officers where the two groups clashed on the streets getting very physical as the tear gas dispersed. UFC fighter Jon Bones Jones was nearby urging people to stay home. “We live here, we all live here and that’s just what doesn’t make sense. We live here, we’ve got to go eat at these same restaurants tomorrow, we have to take our kids for a walk and see the inappropriate gestures and words written all over the walls,” said Jones. Several buildings downtown are now covered in graffiti, some messages against police. In just a few hours, clean up will begin and businesses will return to find their stores vandalized. For some who’ve been struggling because of the recent health orders, this could be another hit. KRQE News 13 is waiting for Albuquerque Police to call back to determine if any arrests were made. APD reports that they deployed their Emergency Response Teams to stop people who were vandalizing property. Police say shots were fired at police on Central in front of the KiMo Theatre. At this time, APD says there are no reports of injuries but there is property damage to several properties including broken windows, looting, and small fires. It’s unclear which group is responsible for the downtown protests that turned violent but it is not believed to be those with the earlier Black Lives Matter demonstration near the University of New Mexico on Sunday where things were peaceful. Locals held a vigil honoring the life of George Floyd. APD reports Monday morning that Central from 1st to 8th Street is closed to the public.

Some Latino families separated by distance or with loved ones serving time in prisons are bypassing COVID-19 restrictions on visits by sending dedications and messages through the airwaves and Internet via two of the nation’s longest working disc jockeys. With the novel coronavirus forcing these families in the American Southwest and New England residents to stay home, some are turning to the two popular radio shows to reaffirm public declarations of love — or pain — even while the shows’ vulnerable, elder DJs have to sequester, too. They also allow listeners to ease their anxieties around national unrest following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis by police. The DJs say they welcome the challenge and will do what they can to bring joy amid uncertainty. The two shows have long been popular with Latinos and those with family members in prison. But now those in lockdown are sending messages to others in lockdown. “We’re all in confinement today,” Massó, 69, said. The 94-old-year Laboe is insulated in his Palm Springs, California, home while still hosting his syndicated oldies show, according to Dale Berger, Laboe’s business partner. Still, he insists that the show continue, even though he has to call in from home or record promos. “We don’t want him out and anywhere near the studio,” Berger said. “He can’t catch this thing.” Born Arthur Egnoian in Salt Lake City to an Armenian American family, Laboe gained fame when he worked as a DJ for KXLA in Los Angeles. He was one of the first DJs to play R&B and rock ‘n’ roll in California and is credited by scholars for helping integrate dance halls among Latinos, blacks, Asian Americans and whites who were drawn to his multicultural musical line up. Over the decades, Laboe maintained a fan base, especially among Mexican Americans who followed him from station to station. He started getting calls from inmates’ family members in the 1990s on his syndicated oldies show. Current and former gang members were some of his most loyal fans. ADVERTISEMENTSkip ................................................................ “I don’t judge,” Laboe said in an interview with The Associated Press at his Palm Springs studio last year. “I like people.” Today, his Sunday show airs in California, Arizona, and Nevada. It’s also popular in New Mexico where audiences listen online. Massó began “Con Salsa!” 45 years ago on Boston University’s public radio station while he was a high school teacher in the city. In addition to playing salsa and Afro-Latino artists, Masso has used the show as a community forum and a vehicle for families to communicate with inmates. The show runs from 10 p.m. EDT Saturday until 3 a.m. Sunday, and can be heard in most of Massachusetts, southern New Hampshire and parts of Connecticut. Like Laboe’s show, it also is streamed live online. Bit Massó also has been barred as a nonessential employee from the studio’s Boston University’s public radio station, which has opted to play old “Con Salsa!” shows. And Massó still is receiving letters from inmates and family of inmates. Last month, Massó decided he would try to record new shows from his home. While he worked to get the quality squared, he began live-streaming a version of his show on Facebook. Some battling depression from isolation messaged. They thanked him for bringing delight by allowing Puerto Rican salsero Hector Lavoe to sing about “Mi Gente” (My People),. ADVERTISEMENTSkip ................................................................ A woman had another her request. She had turn 75 and was alone. Could Massó play the following songs? He obliged. “This woman had expected to celebrate alone,” Massó said. “But there on Facebook, strangers across the globe were dancing with her.” ___ This story corrects a previous version to say Massó began Con Salsa! 45 years ago. ___ Associated Press journalist Russell Contreras is a member of the AP’s race and ethnicity team.

While the protests and subsequent police interactions may be shocking to some, many African Americans aren’t surprised because they’ve endured police brutality for decades, said Chris White, director of the Detroit Coalition Against Police Brutality, “What’s happening, it’s the way American society has always been,” White said. U.S. Rep. Joyce Beatty, who was hit by pepper spray Saturday as scuffles broke out near the end of a demonstration in Columbus, Ohio, said police escalated matters by using heavy-handed tactics against “passionate” young demonstrators who were mostly orderly. “Too much force is not the answer to this,” said Beatty, who pressed for peaceful tactics on both sides in a video posted on Twitter by Columbus City Council president Shannon Hardin, who also was pepper-sprayed. Both are African American. In Salt Lake City, a police officer shoved and knocked over an older man who was walking with a cane on a sidewalk near a protest. Another officer stepped in within seconds to assist the man, as did the officer who knocked him down. Police Chief Mike Brown issued a video Sunday saying he’d personally apologized to the man. “It was hard for me to watch what happened, and I know it was even harder for him to experience it,” Brown said. In New York, where video showed two police vehicles driving into a crowd, knocking aside demonstrators, Mayor Bill de Blasio decried what he called “structural racism” that leads to violence against minorities, but also defended police. “It is inappropriate for protesters to surround a police vehicle and threaten police officers,” he said. “That’s wrong on its face and that hasn’t happened in the history of protests in this city.” ADVERTISEMENTSkip ................................................................ Two police officers in Atlanta were fired and three others placed on desk duty over excessive use of force during a protest incident involving two college students Saturday night. Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said Sunday that she and the police chief made the decision after reviewing body-camera footage. Footage shown on TV as captured by local reporters shows a group of police officers in riot gear and gas masks surround a car being driven by a man with a woman in the passenger seat. The officers pull the woman out and appear to use a stun gun on the man. They use zip-tie handcuffs on the woman on the ground. In a message some saw as encouraging police violence, President Donald Trump praised U.S. Secret Service officers guarding the White House amid demonstrations and said any protesters who breached its fence would face “the most vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons, I have ever seen. That’s when people would have been really badly hurt, at least.” In a letter titled “Dear America,” civil rights leader Rev. William Barber II, a pastor at Greenleaf Christian Church in Goldsboro, North Carolina, said protesters have the right to decry “brutal and inhumane” treatment at the hands of police. “What if, instead of a President who tweets ‘when the looting starts, the shooting starts,’ we had leadership that could unequivocally say, ‘When you use police power in the name of the state to murder, lynch, and destroy, you will be prosecuted for your crimes,'” Barber wrote. Trump wasn’t alone in using loaded language. The Minnesota Department of Public Safety sent a tweet Saturday saying it would strengthen its response to “a sophisticated network of urban warfare.” Hours later, video emerged of police shooting paint projectiles at people gathered on the front porch of a home after curfew in Minneapolis. “Light ’em up,” a man is heard saying before the shooting began. No one appeared seriously injured. Activist Meeko Williams organized a peaceful demonstration in Detroit on Friday and later traveled to Minnesota to help support organizers there. Trying to understand what he sees as increasingly aggressive law enforcement tactics, Williams said police shouldn’t “antagonize, provoke or instigate” protesters. ADVERTISEMENTSkip ................................................................ “I don’t know what’s going to happen over these next few days in this country because they want these killer cops arrested and they’re not going to stop until they are,” Williams said, referring to the lack of charges against the other three officers at the scene when Floyd’s neck was pinned under Chauvin’s knee. “People are just sick and tired of being in this predicament, where innocent life has been taken at the hands of those who were to protect and serve us. We have not been heard.” Some protesters are increasing efforts to protect themselves. On Sunday, Black Lives Matter organizers in Tampa, Florida, had nearly 100 safety marshals in fluorescent vests patrolling their march, trained in de-escalation tactics. The group also had medics and enlisted lawyers and those with legal training to watch out for protesters’ rights from the sidelines. In New York, a police labor group, the Detectives’ Endowment Association, noted some police there had been attacked and patrol cars set ablaze. “As we do everything to stop NYC from burning, all we hear from elected officials is criticism,” the group tweeted. “Maybe they should try it on the front lines.” ___ Reeves and Stafford are members of the AP’s Race and Ethnicity team.

""And without the guidance and validation of their caregivers, they may be navigating their feelings alone.""Take care of you firstHow can a parent help their child traverse these disturbing times?Let the child's age and level of development guide you, experts say, but first, be sure that you are in the right frame of mind.""A parent's first step is to take care of themselves, their mental health, their emotional health.

She suggests parents find ways to channel that energy with positive actions, such as deep breathing and re-grounding exercises, before playing with or talking to your kids.""This doesn't mean letting go of the anger or anxiety, it just means organizing it better so you can think and act more clearly,"" she said.Once a parent is fully available to be a calm, rational voice, ""then you can parse out what's important to pass onto your child so that you're not oversharing information that may further traumatize them or make them feel insecure or unsafe,"" Heard-Garris said.Infants and toddlersWhile children younger than three aren't going to understand what is happening on television, they will be able to pick up on the ""fear, urgency, or anger in people's voices and behaviors,"" Radesky said.At this age, stress shows up in fussy or unregulated behavior. To keep that from occurring, parents should read, listen to or watch the news when the baby isn't physically there.""Watch what you need to stay informed about your community, but then turn it off and do something that makes your family feel connected and whole,"" Radesky said. ""You may need to re-ground yourself or regulate your thoughts and feelings before re-engaging with your kids.""This is the time to begin teaching your child about systemic racism and how to identify and refute it, experts say.Racist stereotypes and bias begin at a shockingly young age.As early as six months, a baby's brain can notice race-based differences, and can internalize racial bias by ages two to four, said Maryland pediatrician Dr. Jacqueline Dougé, who co-authored the AAP's statement on the impact of racism on child and adolescent health.""Learning"" racism is a lot like learning a new language for babies and toddlers, wrote Dougé and California pediatrician Dr. Ashaunta Anderson in a separate commentary. It can happen without parental input, just by the racial stereotypes so prevalent in society.By age 12, many children become set in their beliefs. That gives parents ""a decade to mold the learning process, so that it decreases racial bias and improves cultural understanding,"" they wrote.While helpful for all races, it's especially important for white children to see brown and black kids in a positive light to fight systemic racism, experts say. Books that profile multi-racial characters are an excellent way for parents to do that. And since it's never too early to read to a baby, start right away.Common Sense Media, a nonprofit that rates movies, TV shows, books, apps and other media for parents and schools, has curated a list of 80 books with diverse, multi-cultural characters for preschoolers and older, some of which could easily be suitable for babies and toddlers.""There's also a website called the Brown Bookshelf,"" said Heard-Garris. ""These are books that have, brown and black protagonists who deal at times with tough issues. I think books are really, really fundamental, especially for younger kids.""Preschool and elementary agesThis is the age when kids begin to ask questions on why other people look different than they do.""If your child asks about someone's skin tone, you might say, 'Isn't it wonderful that we are all so different!' You can even hold your arm against theirs to show the differences in skin tones in your family,"" according to Dougé and Anderson.At this age, children will see and absorb disturbing images from protests and riots literally, ""likely focusing on worrying about a burning van or a scary-looking person in a mask,"" Radesky said.Parents should do their best to limit the exposure children this age have to media, whether television, smart phones or tablets, experts say.""This can be done by setting certain times that children can use their devices, co-view the content with their children, find other activities like playing outside, games, cooking together, set rules that kids should use the devices in a common area where parents can check in,"" Dougé said.""These times also provide opportunities for parents to model the behavior they want their kids to follow by also limiting their exposure to media,"" Dougé added.But as Boyd said, children will likely have already overheard adult conversations, or been exposed to what is happening via social media accounts and conversations with friends.""Parents who have not already, should proactively engage their kids around these distressing events,"" Boyd said. ""Ask them what they know and what they've seen. Ask them how they are feeling. Validate their feelings and let them know what you are doing to keep them safe -- be it in your home or your community.""Parents will also need to give their children the broader societal context of racism in order to try to explain the rage of protestors filling the streets of cities across the nation, Radesky said.By doing so, parents can help build empathy and teach perspective-taking, rather than focusing on the child's specific fears.""Instead of focusing on questions the child may have about concrete things, ask them questions like 'How do you think those people were feeling? Do you know why they were angry? What do you do when you feel like something is unfair?' "" Radesky said.""Providing a controlled space to understand what is going on and ways to process it will help children navigate the distressing emotions, helplessness and fear they may be experiencing,"" Boyd said.Age-appropriate books that deal with discrimination and explain feelings from different perspectives are extremely helpful during this time, experts say.""You can also show them videos of peaceful protests from the past, where people were inspired to demand fair treatment,"" said Radesky, while warning that some YouTube videos can contain intense political and disinformation ads occurring before and during videos.""Just skip those and start showing your young kids the Martin Luther King Jr. or other video once the ad has passed,"" Radesky suggested. ""For older children, you can ask them what they think of different ads and whether they're trustworthy.""'The talk'For black families, there is another, more painful necessity at this age, known as ""the talk."" It's a series of ""don'ts"" black families have passed on for generations: Don't resist police. Stay away from bad places. Be respectful to white people and stay away from confrontation with white men, especially police.""We're black folks, so we don't have a choice but to talk about race and talk about racism,"" said Heard-Garris, who has a 7-year-old son. ""So he can tell you probably more eloquently than I can about racism and he's seven.""She recalls with pain when he asked her if he would be the target of police violence at the tender age of four after he heard adults talk about a recent police shooting of an unarmed black man.""He said to me, 'Are police here to help me or do they shoot me? I thought they're supposed to keep me safe. I thought they were supposed to keep us safe.' And he was four,"" she related.""And so we had a long conversation about how police are supposed to keep us safe, and I assured him that as his mom, that's my job. 'My first job is to always keep you safe,' I told him.""""As he grows, I'm going to have to have a more frank conversation that, 'Unfortunately, you're going to do all the right things, but you might not be safe."" And that's going to be a hard day for us.""The recent deaths of Breonna Taylor, an EMT who was killed in March after officers forced their way inside her home; Ahmaud Arbery, the 25-year-old unarmed black man shot while taking a jog in rural Georgia in February; and now George Floyd's death, has many black parents afraid that ""the talk"" may not be enough.""The problem here is systemic racism and disregard for black lives,"" Heard-Garris said. ""And so as a doctor, I don't just treat a patient that has a fever when they have a bacterial infection, right?""I give them antibiotics. I don't just keep giving them Tylenol because that's not going to treat the infection. And I think as a country we need to treat the illness, which is systemic racism.""As Heard-Garris's story illustrates, when to begin ""the talk"" will be unique for each child and family, Boyd said.""For some, it may be earlier than expected, because evidence indicates black children in particular are often perceived as older and less innocent than they are. For black girls, this process of adultification can begin as young as age 5, and for black boys, it can begin by age 10,"" Boyd said.""Beginning 'the talk' with school-aged children can prepare them for these encounters before they occur and equip them with tools that can be life saving,"" Boyd added.As an African-American pediatrician, Boyd discusses the topic often with parents of children in her care. She advises black parents to think of ""the talk"" as more of a process than a singular conversation.""That process may begin with introducing stories through age-appropriate books or films that can generate questions you answer together. Or it can be an ongoing dialogue that is sparked by current events. Just remember to include specific guidance that enables your child to know their rights and the steps they can take to try and stay safe. And always be sure to let your child know it isn't fair they have to learn these lessons so young. But you are teaching then to try to keep them safe,"" Boyd said.White parents can have ""the talk"" too, Boyd said.""It's an important moment to build empathy with your child,"" she said. ""It is also important to highlight the other children who may have fears or concerns related to their safety, and to model and practice 'upstanding' or acting in defense of those around them.""Tweens and teensOf course, tweens and teens will likely be seeing all the coverage of police brutality and protests on their personal smartphones. Most teens get comfort by communicating with their friends on social media, Heard-Garris said. Some teens have even begun participating in online activism.""Online activism is a coping response for some adolescents, especially right now while we're physically distant,"" Heard-Garris said. ""Reposting, retweeting, expressing how they're feeling, chatting with friends has been helpful, sort of an active kind of coping response.""Other teens, especially those that are not of a minority background, so those that are white, are educating themselves about why this is happening, what's the history of our country, what's happening right now. Intellectualizing the issues has been helpful for them to understand this is not just a today problem, this has been going on for years,'"" Heard-Garris said.At this age, kids will be able to think more abstractly about racism, injustice and violent versus peaceful protest and discuss their views with parents, experts say.""Parents can ask their tweens or teens whether they've seen anything online about the riots and protests, what they think, and what about it was upsetting or inspiring,"" Radesky said.As the parent of any teenager will attest, direct questioning of teens often doesn't produce constructive responses.""I dunno,"" is a typical reaction, so Radesky suggests parents also try asking about the types of unfairness kids see or feel in their everyday lives.Parents can also make good use of movies and documentaries that can educate older teens on the history of discrimination. Common Sense Media has lists of movies that discuss racism or inspire kids to ""change the world,"" which can be used to jump start conversations about racism and how they can help fight it, Radesky said.""You don't need to preach to children about what is 'right' or 'wrong,'"" she said. ""It's better to have a conversation where they come to their own understanding and can see things in a larger social context.""Kira Banks, a clinical psychologist whose website ""Raising Equity"" provides free videos and resources on how parents can fight racism and cultivate an open mind in themselves and their kids, suggests parents watch movies like ""13th,"" a powerful look at institutional racism in the justice system that premiered in 2016 to a standing ovation at the New York Film Festival.""Is this a teachable moment? Absolutely. It must be, it has to be,"" Banks said. ""And if a person hasn't done the work to understand the history of racism and discrimination in America, they should do so, and then join us in raising our children to see and disrupt racism, and be the change we want to see.""The work must be done by all social classes and races, experts say, including the most privileged.""White and non-black families should not shield their older children from these images,"" Radesky said. ""We need to engage our children in a conversation about racism, and use these events as a catalyst.""While it is upsetting to watch, we need to sit with that discomfort and teach our families how to channel that energy to work to dismantle the racist structures that exist in our communities.""",0.0

(KRQE) – The clean-up process has started in downtown Albuquerque Monday morning following a riot that happened overnight. City crews are now cleaning up 3rd Street and Central where some businesses had their windows smashed and others were tagged with graffiti. The historic KiMo Theatre was one of the buildings targeted by rioters following what began as a peaceful protest in honor of Minneapolis’ George Floyd who was killed after a police officer knelt on his neck during his arrest. The Albuquerque Police Department reports that Monday morning the public is urged to avoid the downtown area, specifically between Copper and Silver and 1st and 8th Street as crews are at the location. Only business owners and residents will have access to the area until all businesses are secured. APD reports that property damage in the area included broken windows, some looting, and small fires. A KRQE News 13 crew at the scene Monday morning reports the smell of smoke still lingered in the air following the fires set by rioters as well as the smoke canisters set off by police to disperse the crowd. It’s unclear which group is responsible for the downtown riot that turned violent but it is not believed to be those with the earlier Black Lives Matter demonstration near the University of New Mexico on Sunday where things were peaceful.

Benchmarks rose in Tokyo, Hong Kong and Seoul but fell in Shanghai and Sydney. Jakarta’s main index jumped 2% and Singapore’s was up 1.2% as authorities were winding down some pandemic precautions. The gains also tracked a modest advance on Wall Street overnight. Investors are balancing cautious optimism about the reopening of businesses shut down because of the pandemic against worries that widespread protests in the U.S. over police brutality could disrupt the economic recovery and widen the outbreak.

Hopes for a quick recovery from the worst global downturn since the 1930s have helped spur buying. But Robert Carnell, regional head of research for the Asia-Pacific region at ING, warned against too much optimism, given the tensions between the U.S. and China, unrest in Hong Kong and the U.S., and uncertainties over prospects for a vaccine or dependable treatments for COVID-19, the illness caused by the new coronavirus. “How long can markets remain buoyant?” he asked. “The honest answer, and one that may save you five minutes is, ‘I don’t know’ “ The protests that have rocked American cities for days have so far not had much impact on financial markets. But the violence and damage to property may hinder the re-opening of the economy. Crowds gathering to protest injustice and racism also could touch off more outbreaks. “The market has been expecting a springtime for economic activity,” said Mike Zigmont, head of trading and research at Harvest Volatility Management. “If these events derail the animal spirits that the markets have been counting on across the country, then I think they will have an impact. But investors are dismissing it as a short-term, non-event.” On Wall Street, the S&P 500 climbed 0.4% to 3,055.73 after wavering between small gains and losses. Banks, companies that depend on consumer spending and communications companies accounted for a big slice of the gains. Health care was the only sector to fall.

Stocks have now recouped most of their losses after the initial economic fallout from the coronavirus knocked the market into a breathtaking 34% skid in February and March. The S&P 500 is now down just under 10% from its all-time high in February. The Federal Reserve and Congress have pledged unprecedented amounts of aid for the economy. That helped spur the market’s move higher from its March lows. Now investors are betting that the worst of the recession has already passed, or will soon, as governments around the country and around the world slowly lift restrictions meant to corral the outbreak. “I think we are through the worst of it for sure, and the markets reflect that in the bounce we’ve seen,” said David Trainer, CEO of investment research firm New Constructs.

Earlier Sunday, people at one point laid on the ground on their stomachs with their hands behind their backs and chanted “I can’t breathe” for several minutes. At a protest that drew several hundred people in Colorado Springs, the same symbolic act played out in reference to what happened before George Floyd died in Minneapolis. The protests over Floyd’s death came after a turbulent protest that led to the arrest of 83 people Saturday night, most for breaking a curfew and some others for damaging property or having prohibited weapons, Denver police said. People brought crowbars, bats and rifles to the demonstration, Denver Police Chief Paul Pazen said. Denver Mayor Michael Hancock ordered the overnight curfew on Saturday after violent protests at the state Capitol on Friday. He called the behavior of unruly protesters “reckless, inexcusable and unacceptable” and blamed “outside instigators” for hijacking the important message of peaceful protesters who are rightfully decrying what happened to Floyd. “What justice is served by breaking windows at the library or city hall?” Hancock said. “Whose life are you honoring when you loot businesses in our city, businesses already struggling to survive in one of the toughest times imaginable? What change do you inspire by setting a car on fire, throwing rocks at police officers or vandalizing people’s property?” The longtime mayor added: “The person who brought a crowbar last night wasn’t thinking about George Floyd. Neither were the people who brought assault rifles and handguns and explosive bombs. They weren’t thinking about George Floyd.” Floyd, a black man, died after a white Minneapolis officer pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck even after he stopped moving and pleading for air, leading to the protests in Denver and cities across the U.S. and Europe. Enforcing a Saturday night curfew, officers dressed in riot gear knocked down a barricade of fencing and road signs built by protesters next to the Capitol and fired tear gas. Some protesters threw the gas canisters back at police, and hundreds of people scattered amid the smoke. ADVERTISEMENTSkip ................................................................ Three police officers and another person were injured when a car crashed into a police cruiser. The three officers are all expected to recover, Pazen said. The condition of the other person was unknown. Pazen said they had found the driver and the car and that the case was under investigation. Esther Okanlawon was among the demonstrators Sunday afternoon when things remained calm. She said brought her 6-year-old daughter to the protest to show her how to make change. She has talked to her daughter about racism, the Denver Post reported. “We tell her that unfortunately people are going to treat her differently because of the color of her skin,” Okanlawon said. Amanda Sendero and Garrett Teal were among the volunteers helping cleanup the city. Sendero and Teal participated in the protest Saturday night and came back Sunday wearing masks and latex gloves as they put trash into bags saying it was a way to show they care about the city where they live. “I do not want people to see all this destruction and junk and think this is the way,” said Teal, who recently moved to Denver from Florida.

DALLAS — Dallas police enforced a nighttime curfew by making dozens of arrests Sunday night, in a crackdown after several days of demonstrations that saw multiple eruptions of violence. Dallas officials earlier in the day announced the curfew that would run from 7 p.m. to 6 a.m., and squad cars and police on foot quickly moved in to pick up anyone still on the downtown streets once it started. Dallas police tweeted photos Sunday night as officers started making arrests, and within a few hours announced at least 70 arrests and noted “there is very little activity occurring in the downtown Dallas area.” Police Chief U. Renee Hall said the curfew could be in effect “for the next several days” and that several suburban police departments had volunteered officers to help. “We will not tolerate any more damage to our city,” Hall said. ADVERTISEMENTSkip ................................................................ The curfew measure was put in place as Texas cities braced for the possibility of another night of unrest and sought to prevent a repeat of the violence that broke out at weekend protests over the death of George Floyd and the treatment of black people by police. Thousands of people took to the streets in cities throughout the country Friday and Saturday to protest Floyd’s death after a white Minneapolis police officer used his knee to pin Floyd’s neck down for several minutes as Floyd pleaded for air and eventually stopped moving. Floyd grew up in Houston and his body is set to be returned to the city for burial. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott declared a statewide disaster on Sunday, which allows him to designate federal agents to do the work of local police. These moves come as some Texas organizers are calling off demonstrations and others said they planned to proceed. “Every Texan and every American has the right to protest and I encourage all Texans to exercise their First Amendment rights,” Abbott, a Republican, said in a statement. “However, violence against others and the destruction of property is unacceptable and counterproductive. As protests have turned violent in various areas across the state, it is crucial that we maintain order, uphold public safety, and protect against property damage or loss. Dallas also closed several downtown civic buildings to the public on Monday, including a civil courthouse and the county administration building. In Austin, the state Capitol grounds were closed Sunday after it was vandalized Saturday. One group cancelled a rally because they felt they couldn’t ensure the safety of African American protesters. But other protesters still gathered outside the Capitol, and marched on city hall and police headquarters. Some protesters also walked onto an Austin highway and blocked traffic Sunday afternoon. The city didn’t have a curfew and hundreds of demonstrators stayed on the streets between the Capitol building and police department after dark. Smoke billowed over the roadway as police cleared out the protests and then formed a line to stop them from re-entering. Some protesters said the smoke was tear gas, but police said on Twitter that they did not use tear gas. Late Sunday night, live television cameras showed police firing bean bags or rubber bullets and pepper spray into a crowd of several hundred still gathered outside of the police station. Houston police have reached out to Floyd’s family to offer security as they return his body to the city, said Chief Art Acevedo. But news reports that the chief offered the family a police funeral procession were based on a misunderstanding, Acevedo said. “We’re really worried about people getting hurt and people getting sick” while Floyd’s body is moved, he told The Associated Press. “What I’m talking about is keeping everyone away so we don’t have any problems.",0.0

It appeared several people were taken into custody by police, KPNX said. The confrontation happened hours after Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey declared a state of emergency Sunday and announced a statewide, weeklong curfew after several nights of protests turned destructive and violent. The curfew will last from 8 p.m. to 5 a.m. each night until June 8, Ducey said in a statement, adding that the emergency declaration “authorizes an expanded National Guard mobilization to protect life and property throughout the state.” ADVERTISEMENTSkip ................................................................ The Republican governor also said police “will be equipped to make arrests of individuals who are planning to riot, loot or cause damage and unrest.” Earlier Sunday, the protests held in downtown Phoenix appeared to be peaceful, according to local media reports, An hour before the curfew went into effect, activist Armonee Jackson told protesters in the parking lot of an art gallery downtown that they should avoid any violence, the Republic reported. “Listen to me: We are not ending in violence. I refuse to end in violence,” Jackson told the crowd. David Riutta told the newspaper that he came out to protest police brutality and wants to see a panel of civilians investigate officers’ use-of-force cases. Protests have erupted in U.S. cities and Europe in the days after the death of George Floyd, a black man who died May 25 after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee on Floyd’s neck until he stopped breathing. Phoenix’s first protest unfolded after a Friday vigil for Dion Johnson, a 28-year-old black man who was fatally shot during an encounter with state trooper along a city freeway. Downtown Phoenix has seen three consecutive nights of protests with damage done to 18 buildings that Police Chief Jeri Williams said will cost hundreds of thousands of dollars to repair. ADVERTISEMENTSkip ................................................................ On Saturday night, people knelt with their hands up in the streets outside Phoenix police and municipal buildings, chanting, “Hands up, don’t shoot” and “Black lives matter.” Officers used flash-bang grenades to disperse the crowd. Police said 114 people were arrested on suspicion of rioting and unlawful assembly with five also accused of aggravated assault on a police officer. Seven juveniles were detained for curfew violations and charges of rioting and unlawful assembly, police said. In Tucson, protesters damaged some downtown buildings and vandalized the city’s police station over two nights leading to a handful of arrests. The upscale Phoenix suburb of Scottsdale was targeted by protesters for the first time Saturday night with some people smashing windows at a dozen stores in and around the city’s Fashion Square before grabbing goods. Scottsdale police said in a statement that 12 people were arrested on various charges and “at least one assault has been reported and millions of dollars in damages and theft occurred.” Volunteers used shovels and brooms Sunday to clean up broken glass at the damaged Scottsdale stores and covered windows with plywood boards. “The looting and violence we saw last night, especially in Scottsdale, simply cannot be tolerated.

For Americans of a certain age — and for those mindful of the past — it is impossible to ignore the similarities between these past few days and some of the more unsettling moments from the 1960s. In particular 1968, a year marred by assassinations and violent social unrest. And there are reasons to believe that 2020, not yet half done, may even surpass 1968 as one of American history’s most powerful social and political flashpoints. From an impeachment trial to a devastating pandemic, from galloping unemployment to George Floyd’s death at the hands of Minneapolis police, all the threads are there, flowing together into a raging, muddied river that serves up unimaginable challenges. “All these things are being woven together,” says historian Thurston Clarke, author of “The Last Campaign,” which chronicles Robert F. Kennedy’s 1968 presidential campaign and assassination on June 6 of that year. “It’s like an anti-hit parade, a convergence of the greatest catastrophes of the past 100 years or so, all hitting us at once,” Clarke says. “And with what hope?” In the morass that is 2020, history’s ghosts from an assortment of American eras have resurfaced: — From 1918, when a pandemic’s first wave ravaged, ebbed and then gave way to a more powerful second wave. — From 1930, when an economic crash revealed its longer-term effects on American citizens in the form of the Great Depression. ADVERTISEMENTSkip ................................................................ — From 1974, and the governmental disarray that preceded Richard M. Nixon’s resignation, echoed in January and February with the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump. — From 1992, and its images of Los Angeles burning after the acquittal of four police officers in the beating of Rodney King. Perhaps the most uncomfortable era to summon for comparison is the one no one really wants to talk about: 1860, when the final pieces of polarization fell into place for what would be a cataclysmic Civil War. Slavery, America’s greatest historical shame, was the flashpoint then. Today, it is police brutality against black people, a descendant of that awful legacy. Then, as now, there was deep economic disparity, and a debate between individual rights and the common good. Different visions of American life. Different sets of facts and ever-hazier notions of truth. “What’s fundamentally common for all of these things in our history is a lack of agreement of what reality is — a lack of agreement about facts, about causes,” says U.S. historian John Baick of Western New England University. “When we can’t agree on basic truth, we reach our greatest periods of divide.” Now, we also must navigate a social media landscape overloaded with instantly uploaded imagery to persuade and provoke — an echo chamber full of lighter fluid that itself is a subject of national contention, thanks in part to the president. Problems sometimes addressed, sometimes ignored, never truly solved. That’s what makes the deepest impression on Frederick Gooding Jr., who teaches about race. He sees parallels between today and the Reconstruction period that immediately followed the Civil War, when African Americans — coming off a war that, on paper, rebooted American society for them — were confronted with the realities of life in the postwar United States. ADVERTISEMENTSkip ................................................................ “You had the premise that `I’m free, but I walk the streets in psychological terror,'” says Gooding, an associate professor of African American studies at Texas Christian University. “There really is nothing new under the sun here about the fundamental structure of our society and the way it behaves,” Gooding says. “The cycle is starting to repeat. There’s outrage, it flares up, there’s new understanding, things are put in place, and then it rears its head again.” But right here, right now, 1968 seems the most relevant touchpoint of all. Then, it was politics and economics and race — the death of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. in particular — with the backdrop of the Vietnam War, a long-running national cataclysm that was killing many thousands of Americans. Now, it is politics and economics and race — the death of George Floyd in particular — with the backdrop of the pandemic, a long-running national cataclysm that is killing many thousands of Americans. There are key differences, of course. The power structures have evolved and to some extent are more inclusive, though nowhere near where many hoped they’d be. One example: Chicago, where in 1968 Mayor Richard J. Daley decried the protests at the Democratic National Convention and pushed the aggressive policing that helped make that a national flashpoint. Today, the mayor is Lori Lightfoot, an African American woman and first openly gay person to hold the office. Perhaps the most striking difference is the one that may be fueling the fires of anger across the land: Now, unlike any other moment in history, protesters in one place can, with a device in their pockets, see and hear what’s happening elsewhere and match or surpass it in real time. ADVERTISEMENTSkip ................................................................ Some questions, then: Is this period — what one Minneapolis resident called “a volcano finally erupting after years of simmering” — a singular moment in American life? It’s hard to declare that from within, but it certainly has most of the convulsive themes that have driven and riven U.S. history since its beginnings. Will people gathering and colliding in the most aggressive of fashions — shouting in each other’s faces in the era of the coronavirus — create repercussions we can’t even consider? “This can be kind of a tinderbox for COVID,” protester Rosa Jimenez Cano said in Miami. On Saturday afternoon, the SpaceX rocket streaked into the sky from Cape Canaveral, summoning an American moment of pride, control and expert accomplishment. And like those Apollo missions in the late 1960s and early 1970s, it left a troubled planet behind. “Congratulations to the Astronauts that left Earth today,” actor and comedian Andy Milonakis tweeted. “Good choice.” Below it, all else felt tumultuous, a word that has been used so often to describe 1968 that it has become a cliche. Nevertheless, the word fits 2020, too — like a well-constructed face mask. “For a surprisingly large number of Americans, I think, 1968 marked the end of hope,” Charles Kaiser wrote in “1968 in America,” his 1988 book. “Twenty years later, it may now be possible to start unraveling the mystery of how its traumas and its culture changed us.” Is that how long it will take this time? Will 20 years be enough? And, as with Apollo 11 in 1969, might there be small steps and giant leaps just ahead – breakthroughs in figuring this all out – that help Americans find new ways to soar again? ___ Ted Anthony, director of digital innovation for The Associated Press, has been writing about American culture since 1990.

1622406361,2020-06-01 10:59:26,More journalists injured covering George Floyd protests,https://www.abqjournal.com/1461599/more-journalists-injured-covering-george-floyd-protests.html,en,False,,99,Albuquerque Journal ,http://www.abqjournal.com/,".......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... LOS ANGELES — The first time officers shot rubber bullets at MSNBC host Ali Velshi and his crew Saturday night in Minneapolis, he was willing to believe that the officials didn’t know they were press. The second time, Velshi said, they knew and shot anyway. “We put our hands up and yelled, ‘We’re media!'” Velshi said. “They responded, ‘We don’t care!’ and they opened fire a second time.” Velshi, who said he was hit in the leg by a rubber bullet, is just one of many journalists across the country who sustained injuries from police or protesters while covering the George Floyd protests this weekend. And this occurred after Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz promised that journalists would not be interfered with following the Friday arrest of a CNN crew on live television and other reports of violence against reporters from the city where Floyd died, including freelance photographer Linda Tirado, who said she is blind in her left eye after being shot at by police. Dan Shelley, the executive director and chief operating officer of the Radio Television Digital News Association (RTDNA), said while all the attacks on journalists were “outrageous and unacceptable” that he was particularly upset about the Minneapolis incidents that happened after the Governor made his reassurances. ADVERTISEMENTSkip ................................................................ “They started deliberately attacking journalists who were clearly identifiable and identifying themselves as journalists,” Shelley said. “We’ve heard a number of instances of police officers, either through their words or actions, saying that they just didn’t care. To be a journalist in the Twin Cities last night, particularly in Minneapolis, if you were just arrested, you were lucky.” Minneapolis Star Tribune reporter Chris Serres tweeted Sunday that he was twice ordered at gunpoint to hit the ground. Serres wrote that he was, “Warned that if I moved “an inch” I’d be shot. This after being teargassed and hit in groin area by rubber bullet. Waiving a Star Tribune press badge made no difference.” His Star Tribune colleague Ryan Faircloth’s car was also hit by what were “likely rubber bullets,” which shattered his window and left him with cuts on his arm and brow. Los Angeles Times reporter Molly Hennessey-Fiske said in a video message on Twitter that she and about a dozen other press had identified themselves as such and that Minnesota State Patrol officers still “fired tear gun cannisters on us at point blank range.” Hennessey-Fiske said she got hit in the leg. She said she asked the officers where they should go but they didn’t give the reporters any direction. “They just fired on us,” she said. It wasn’t just Minneapolis where reporters found themselves in harm’s way. Saturday there were journalist injuries reported in cities like New York, Chicago, Washington D.C., Pittsburgh, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, San Diego, Detroit and Denver. Although the situation is fluid and developing, the RTDNA has counted more than 60 incidents across the country in the past 48 hours in which reporters have been, “injured, assaulted or harassed by either protesters or police officers.” ADVERTISEMENTSkip ................................................................ In Chicago, Vice reporter Michael Adams had a similar interaction to Velshi and Hennessey-Fiske when police raided the gas station he and his crew were sheltering at and said they “didn’t care” that they were press. “After shouting press multiple times and raising my press card in the air, I was thrown to the ground,” Adams wrote on Twitter. “Then another cop came up and peppered sprayed me in the face while I was being held down.” Huffington Post reporter Christopher Mathais was arrested Saturday while covering protests in New York. CNN commentator Keith Boykin was also arrested by the NYPD Saturday after he identified himself as press. In Los Angeles, Lexis-Olivier Ray said an LAPD officer hit him in the stomach after he’d identified himself as a journalist “multiple times.” In Washington D.C., Huffington Post reporter Philip Lewis tweeted that he was hit in the leg with rubber bullets. Detroit Free Press news director Jim Schaefer said several of their journalists showing their media badges were pepper-sprayed by Detroit police. And in Denver, 9NEWS reporter Jeremy Jojola tweeted that he got hit with, “Something fired by police” even though he was holding a camera and lights. Sunday, he reflected that he’ll, “Never truly know if we were intentionally targeted or not. I’ll just say we were not doing anything wrong as we were in an area under curfew.” Since the protests began, eight AP journalists have been hurt, though none seriously. Three have been hit by rubber bullets, one was punched, another was knocked down and others fell. The acts of violence and deliberate harassment are further distressing to Shelley because it’s distracting from the real story. “Journalists shouldn’t be the story,” Shelley said. “It is calamitous to see all of these journalists who are merely serving the public by covering these incidents of civil unrest being wantonly attacked…Journalists are representatives of the public and are there to serve the public and to tell the stories of the protesters and of the elected and other public officials trying to deal with the situation.” He added: “It is really harming the public at large, not just the journalist. It’s interfering with their ability to be eyewitnesses and chroniclers of what’s occurring in this country right now.”",0.0

But she said as a black woman, she always felt that her life was under threat from police and she needed to protest that. The demonstrations over the killing of George Floyd, a black man who died after a white Minneapolis officer pressed a knee into his neck, are coming at a time when many cities were beginning to relax stay-at-home orders. That’s especially worrisome for health experts who fear that silent carriers of the virus who have no symptoms could unwittingly infect others at gatherings with people packed cheek to jowl and cheering and jeering without masks. “Whether they’re fired up or not that doesn’t prevent them from getting the virus,” said Bradley Pollock, chairman of the Department of Public Health Sciences at the University of California, Davis. Even for the many protesters who have been wearing masks, those don’t guarantee protection from the coronavirus. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends cloth masks because they can make it more difficult for infected people to spread the virus — but they are not designed to protect the person wearing the mask from getting it. The U.S. has been worst hit by the coronavirus outbreak, with more than 1.7 million cases and over 103,000 deaths, according to a tally kept by Johns Hopkins University. In New York City, where more than 21,000 people have died during the pandemic, a large crowd in Brooklyn tossed water bottles at officers and torched a police van Friday outside the Barclays Center. Officers cleared the crowd by spraying an eye-irritating chemical. ADVERTISEMENTSkip ................................................................ Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said after another night of unrest in Minneapolis that many protesters wearing masks were simply trying to hide their identities and “cause confusion and take advantage of this situation.” “I will continue to stress, because it seems like a lifetime ago: We are still in the middle of a pandemic and passed 1,000 deaths yesterday. We still have hospitals on the verge of being overrun with COVID-19,” he said. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey echoed those concerns: “We have two crises that are sandwiched on top of one other.” The state’s health commissioner had warned just days earlier that the massive protests were almost certain to fuel new cases of the virus. Minnesota reported 35 deaths on Thursday, a single-day high since the start of the outbreak, and 29 more on Friday. But it wasn’t just protesters at risk — unmasked officers stood within arm’s reach of shouting demonstrators. In Atlanta, police Chief Erika Shields waded into a crowd without a mask Friday while she listened to people air frustrations. When Los Angeles officials announced earlier in the week that the city was relaxing stay-at-home orders and reopening stores, they said political protests could resume but with a cap of 100 people. Several hundred people showed up for a protest organized by Black Lives Matter-LA and later shut down a freeway. Most wore masks, but many did not observe a buffer zone. Los Angeles County Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer said Friday that was an ongoing concern. ADVERTISEMENTSkip ................................................................ “Show respect for each other by putting on that face covering so that your respiratory droplets aren’t unintentionally getting into somebody else’s mouth, nose or eyes,” she said. Those same concerns surfaced Saturday in Paris when unions flaunted a ban on large gatherings at a march to protest conditions against undocumented workers and migrants. Police used tear gas to disperse the crowds and said they had banned the march due to the “health risks that such an event is likely to generate.” Meanwhile, the European Union on Saturday urged President Donald Trump to rethink his decision to terminate the U.S. relationship with the World Health Organization as spiking infection rates in India and elsewhere reinforced that the pandemic is far from contained. Trump on Friday charged that the WHO didn’t respond adequately to the pandemic and accused the U.N. agency of being under China’s “total control.” The U.S. is the largest source of financial support for the WHO, and its exit is expected to significantly weaken the organization. The head of the EU’s executive arm urged Trump to reconsider. “The WHO needs to continue being able to lead the international response to pandemics, current and future,” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said. German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas told Germany’s Funke media group that Trump’s decision was the “wrong signal at the wrong time.” In China, where the virus outbreak began, only four new confirmed cases were reported Saturday, all brought from outside the country. More than 6 million coronavirus infections have been reported worldwide, with over 367,000 deaths and more than 2.5 million recoveries, according to the Johns Hopkins tally. The true death toll is widely believed to be significantly higher, with experts saying many victims died of the virus without ever being tested for it. ADVERTISEMENTSkip ................................................................ Elite sporting events will be allowed to resume in England starting Monday, but without spectators, paving the way for the planned June 17 return of the Premier League, the world’s richest soccer competition. England’s deputy chief medical officer Jonathan Van-Tam warned that the situation overall remained precarious. “I believe this is also a very dangerous moment,” he said. “We have to get this right.” India registered another record single-day jump of 7,964 cases and 265 deaths. The government had been expected to end a 2-month-old nationwide lockdown but instead extended measures in some areas due to coronavirus outbreaks. Italy, though, added 111 new victims to its death toll and nearly 420 new infections, in line with its recent daily tallies, suggesting the virus is under control nearly four weeks after the country began gingerly loosening a strict lockdown in the onetime European epicenter of the pandemic. ___ Seewer reported from Toledo, Ohio.

1622406357,2020-06-01 11:06:41,Biden meets with black leaders at local church amid unrest,https://www.abqjournal.com/1461610/biden-meets-with-black-leaders-at-local-church-amid-unrest.html,en,False,,99,Albuquerque Journal ,http://www.abqjournal.com/,"ADVERTISEMENTSkip ................................................................ Without offering specifics, he promised to “deal with institutional racism” and set up a police oversight body in his first 100 days in office, if elected. The former vice president also said he’d be releasing an economic plan focused on education, housing and “access to capital” and investments, especially for minority Americans, later this month. “I really do believe that the blinders have been taken off. I think this tidal wave is moving,” Biden told the mayors of Atlanta, Chicago, Los Angeles and St. Paul, Minnesota. “I realize we’ve got to do something big, we can do it, and everyone will benefit from it.” Largely sheltering in place amid the coronavirus, Biden has struggled in recent weeks to be heard from his makeshift home TV studio over the noise of dueling national crises. But after another night of violent protests, he ventured out into public for the second time in two days and just the third time since the pandemic arrived in mid-March. His hopeful and collaborative approach marked a sharp contrast to that of President Donald Trump, who has made little effort to unify the country. The Republican president slammed governors as “weak” during a video teleconference on Monday and demanded tougher crackdowns on protesters. Trump also lashed out at Biden on Twitter, writing that “Sleepy Joe Biden’s people are so Radical Left that they are working to get the Anarchists out of jail, and probably more.” Biden’s softer style may foreshadow how he presents himself in the five months before the presidential election, emphasizing calm and competence as a contrast to a mercurial president. It is an approach that carries the risk of being drowned out by Trump’s much louder voice. On Monday evening, Trump declared himself “the president of law and order” from the White House as military police and law enforcement fired tear gas and cleared protesters from nearby Lafayette Park. Biden made no mention of the unfolding events during an online fundraiser that took place at the same time, though he talked at length about persistent racism in the U.S. He plans to deliver remarks on the unrest gripping the U.S. on Tuesday in Philadelphia. In the early moments of Monday’s gathering at the Bethel AME church in Wilmington, Biden listened quietly and took notes. All the attendees, including Biden, wore face masks but lowered them as they spoke. ADVERTISEMENTSkip ................................................................ “The vice president came to hear from us. This is a homeboy,” pastor Sylvester Beaman said before everyone bowed their heads in prayer. Biden’s standing with the black community weighs heavily as he works to deny Trump a second term. African Americans rescued Biden’s flailing primary campaign, but it’s unclear if they will turn out for him in large numbers in November. “I want to make something clear. I don’t expect anything from the black community,” Biden said Monday, insisting he has never taken its support for granted. The former vice president has been doing cleanup since telling a prominent black radio host a week and a half ago that African Americans who back Trump “ain’t black.” Yet the mayors who spoke with Biden, three of whom are black, were clearly frustrated and angry with Trump, who has offered military support to address violent protests while denying them federal support to address the coronavirus fallout and repeatedly attacking them on social media. “To see the president of the United States say that he’s going to send the military into our communities but hadn’t mentioned sending a single dime of support into our communities, speaks to where we are in America,” said Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms. Much of Biden’s campaign strategy centers on trying to draw a contrast with Trump on temperament and values. He has called the White House contest a battle for the soul of the nation and has been particularly forceful in condemning Trump’s handling of moments of racial tension. In an election that is likely to be a referendum on the sitting president, some Biden aides say privately that the best plan may be to let Trump do himself in. Yet there is also a recognition that Biden needs to do more than simply wait for voters who may be turned off by Trump to turn toward him. Some Democrats who have criticized Biden for not being more visible during the onset of the coronavirus said he is making the right moves now. “I’m sure they have some reluctance, understandably, right now to politicize it. That’s not who he is,” said Democratic strategist James Carville. “There might be a time for eloquence, but I think that simplicity is eloquence right now.” ___ Jaffe reported from Washington; Peoples reported from Montclair, New Jersey.

Long the target of American criticism, these nations have used the protests over the killing of George Floyd as an opportunity to hit back at the country held up by U.S. leaders for decades as “the shining city upon a hill.” By putting forth images of the unrest, they portray the U.S. as a hypocritical superpower unable to secure its own people, as well as normalizing the violence and repression they visit on their own citizens. “To be clear, though they are trying to sympathize with protesters in the U.S., their aim is to leverage the internal divisions in America, … not to advance the debate on this,” said Ariane Tabatabai, a Middle East fellow who studies Iran at the Washington-based German Marshall Fund. “Regime officials particularly like the theme of racial tensions in the U.S. because it allows them to point the finger at Washington, which is often front and center condemning human rights abuses by the regime,” she said. That’s particularly valuable to Iran, which has violently put down recent nationwide economic demonstrations by killing hundreds, arresting thousands and disrupting internet access. The Islamic Republic has seen its already-ailing economy crater since President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew Washington from Tehran’s nuclear deal with world powers, cutting off its oil sales. “The American regime is pursuing violence and bullying at home and abroad,” Mousavi said. That criticism has extended to Twitter, which Iranian officials use extensively despite the website being banned since the mass protests and crackdown surrounding its disputed 2009 presidential election. Former hard-line President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, whose disputed re-election sparked the 2009 unrest, called Floyd’s killing “disturbing & upsetting.” ADVERTISEMENTSkip ................................................................ Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif offered a rewritten statement earlier issued by U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, crossing out Iran and replacing it with America. Pompeo responded by tweeting: “You hang homosexuals, stone women and exterminate Jews.” State-controlled media in China saw the protests through the prism of American views on Hong Kong’s anti-government demonstrations, which China has long said the U.S. encouraged. In a commentary, the ruling Communist Party newspaper Global Times said Chinese experts had noted that U.S. politicians might think twice before commenting again on Hong Kong, knowing “their words might backfire.” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian offered his own criticism at a Beijing news conference. The protests “once again reflect the racial discrimination in the U.S., the serious problems of police violent enforcement and the urgency of solving these problems,” Zhao said. He added that China hopes the U.S. will “safeguard and guarantee the legal rights of ethnic minorities.” That’s as China continues a yearslong, massive crackdown that has locked away more than 1 million ethnic minorities, most of them Muslims. In North Korea, the country’s official Rodong Sinmun newspaper reported about the demonstrations, saying that protesters “harshly condemned” a white policeman’s “lawless and brutal murder” of a black citizen. Three large photos showed protests from recent days from Minneapolis, where Floyd died May 25 after a white police officer pressed his knee on Floyd’s neck for several minutes. The officer was fired and charged with murder, but protesters are demanding the three other officers at the scene be prosecuted. ADVERTISEMENTSkip ................................................................ Rodong Sinmun noted hundreds of protesters gathered in front of the White House chanting, “No justice, no peace.” It did not make any direct comments about Trump, whom North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has met three times in high-profile summits. Russia said the United States had systemic human rights problems, criticism that followed a pattern dating to the Cold War. The 1957 integration of Little Rock Central High School by nine African American students supported by bayonet-carrying soldiers of the 101st Airborne Division saw one Soviet newspaper use the headline: “Troops Advance Against Children!” That information warfare continues today in the cyber-realm, as U.S. intelligence agencies say Russia meddled America’s 2016 presidential election. Tabatabai said she and her colleagues had been tracking Chinese, Iranian and Russian social media accounts using the hashtags #BlackLivesMatter and #GeorgeFloyd. U.S. allies as well have been expressing their own opinions on the unrest. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s spokesman said the arrests and assaults on journalists were “very concerning.” Zimbabwe summoned the U.S. ambassador over U.S. national security adviser Robert O’Brien’s allegation this weekend that Harare could be one of several foreign adversaries taking advantage of the demonstrations. Meanwhile, Germany’s center-left Social Democratic Party, which is a member of Chancellor Angela Merkel’s governing coalition, on Monday described itself as “157 (years old) and Antifa. Naturally.” The tweet appeared to be a response to Trump’s assertion that he would designate Antifa, an umbrella description for the far-left-leaning militant groups that resist neo-Nazis and white supremacists at demonstrations and other events, “a terrorist organization.” Across from the U.S. Embassy in Paris, dozens of people knelt in silent protest, urging the French government to take racism and police violence more seriously. Despite a ban on gatherings of more than 10 people because of the coronavirus, they held signs reading “I Can’t Breathe” in English, or “Racism is suffocating us” and “We are all George Floyd” in French. Thousands of people packed Dam Square in central Amsterdam and spilled into several side streets in an unexpectedly large protest to denounce police brutality in the U.S. and Europe. They chanted “Black lives matter!” raising their fists and holding anti-racism signs. ADVERTISEMENTSkip ................................................................ In Perth, Australia, the hundreds of demonstrators who peacefully protested Floyd’s death also sought to highlight injustices against indigenous Australians. “I believe it’s important as a young indigenous woman to vocalise that this isn’t just an American issue, this is a black people issue and indigenous people fit into that category,” organizer Tanesha Bennell told Nine Network television. Protesters carried banners with messages including “No Pride in Genocide” and tears appeared as the names of indigenous people who have died in Australian police custody were read to the crowd. ___ Associated Press writers Ken Moritsugu in Beijing, Kim Tong-hyung in Seoul, South Korea, Frank Jordans in Berlin, Jill Lawless in London, Farai Mutsaka in Harare, Zimbabwe, and Colleen Berry in Milan contributed. ___ Follow the AP’s latest news about the protests in the U.S. at https://apnews.com/GeorgeFloyd",0.0

Wait, I get it. The nationwide calls for justice, as Floyd's death was ruled, a homicide by both the Hennepin County Medical examiner and in an independent autopsy authorized by the family. The autopsy shows that Mr Floyd had no underlying medical problem that caused or contributed to his death. Cause of death, in my opinion, is that's fix CIA due to compression of the neck.

Demonstrators who had been on the West Side Highway in lower Manhattan were herded off, with parts of the roadway blocked off behind them.“Something has to break, and it’s not going to be us,” said Evan Kutcher, one of hundreds of demonstrators who stood outside the Barclays Center chanting Floyd’s name Tuesday evening. “We’re here because something needs to change.MINNEAPOLIS — Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, who is taking over the prosecution in George Floyd's death, said Monday night that he will ""hold everyone accountable.""""I can assure you we are taking a fresh look,"" Ellison told CNN. ""We plan to hold everyone accountable who is legally culpable,"" he said, explaining that while he has spent the last 24 hours reviewing evidence, he cannot ethically comment as a prosecutor.""We are looking very carefully at holding everybody accountable who failed to do their duty and fell below the legal requirements of their position, or did something affirmatively that would be in violation of the law,"" Ellison said.""When we are ready, and that won't be long from now, we plan on taking the proper and deliberate action,"" he said.He said earlier in the day that he'd move as ""quickly and effectively"" as possible.""I need to protect this prosecution,"" he told CNN. ""I am not going to create a situation where people can say this was a rush to judgment.""On Sunday, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz announced that Ellison, the former congressman who ran for chair of the Democratic National Committee in 2017, will take the lead in the case of Floyd's killing.WASHINGTON D.C. — The U.S. Park Police is denying it used tear gas to disperse a crowd of protesters outside the White House on Monday night, saying officers instead used smoke canisters and pepper balls to aggressively push back the demonstrators.Protesters scrambled as smoke filled the streets and AP journalists witnessed people reacting to their eyes and throats becoming irritated. Journalists covering the protest reported the crowd was largely peaceful at the time; the Park Police said they were responding to protesters throwing items, including bricks and frozen water bottles at law enforcement.Justice Department officials offered a different explanation, saying officers were carrying out Attorney General William Barr’s order to expand the security perimeter outside the White House.Officers repelled the crowd nearly 30 minutes ahead of a 7 p.m. curfew in Washington. Shortly after the crowd was pushed back, President Donald Trump walked through the park where they had gathered for a photo opportunity at a nearby church.--------------Hundreds of people were gathered peacefully tonight at the base of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C. — a mix of black and white, young and old, looked out toward the Washington Monument.Several dozen uniformed guardsmen and women, along with Park Police, were standing on the steps of the monument.There were speakers and prayers and signs, calling for justice and an end to police brutality.“Together we are more,” a speaker said.On a breezy spring evening in Washington, this scene illustrates the peaceful demonstration that is starkly at odds with violent rioting and looting.“Make it quick,” one man said, “curfew is coming up in 30 minutes.”The peaceful demonstration concluded when the 7 p.m. curfew in D.C. went into effect.ATLANTA — Six Atlanta police officers are being charged with using excessive force during an arrest of two college students at a protest on Saturday night, Fulton County District Attorney Paul Howard announced Tuesday.The officers were filmed in downtown Atlanta breaking windows of a vehicle, yanking a woman out of the car and tasing a man. The two victims were later identified as college students at Spellman and Morehouse, both historically black schools, and were returning from protests calling for an end to police violence against black citizens.Arrest warrants have been issued for Lonnie Hood, Willie Sauls, Ivory Streeter, Mark Gardner, Armond Jones and Roland Claud. Some of the charges against the officers include aggravated assault of Messiah Young, aggravated assault of Taniyah Pilgrim, simple battery and criminal damage to property, Howard said.Two of the six officers, Streeter and Gardner, were terminated Sunday by Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms.CHARLESTON, W.Va. — The West Virginia National Guard is pursuing disciplinary action against a guardsman who posted on social media that he would shoot at people protesting the death of George Floyd, officials said Tuesday.The guardsman, Noah Garcelon, has already resigned his position as an officer with the Winfield Police Department after making the comments. In a series of now-deleted posts, Garcelon wrote that he would “start firing live rounds” at protesters and “see how many I can run over before my car breaks down.”Maj. Gen. James Hoyer, who leads the state’s National Guard, said officials will be taking the appropriate disciplinary action related to Garcelon and any others “who make inflammatory comments related to protests going on across the nation.”Winfield Police Department Chief Ron Arthur said Garcelon acknowledged that he made the comments and stressed that he wasn’t a racist before resigning.West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice, a Republican, has urged people to remain peaceful but said he would not hesitate to call in the National Guard if demonstrations in the state became violent.PHILADELPHIA — Joe Biden in a speech on Tuesday condemned President Donald Trump over the use of tear gas against peaceful protesters outside the White House in order to clear a park so that the president could visit a church for a photo opportunity.""The president held up the Bible at St. John's Church yesterday. I just wish he opened it every once in a while instead of just brandishing it,"" the former vice president and presumptive Democratic 2020 nominee said in Philadelphia.Characterizing the moment as a ""battle for the soul of our nation"" — an echo of Biden's central campaign theme — Biden condemned Trump's actions Monday night, which played out on live television as protesters who had been chanting with their hands in the air were suddenly scattered throughout Washington's streets.""When peaceful protestors are dispersed by the order of the president from the doorstep of the people's house, the White House — using tear gas and flash grenades — in order to stage a photo op, a photo op, at one of the most historic churches in the country or at least Washington, DC, we can be forgiven for believing that the president is more interested in power than in principle,"" Biden said.LAS VEGAS — An officer has been shot in Las Vegas and authorities are responding to another shooting as people protest the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, authorities said.The officer was shot in the area of the Las Vegas Strip and an officer was involved in a shooting in the downtown area, according to the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department.The department said both shootings were on Las Vegas Boulevard.Protesters have been rallying for days across the country over the death of Floyd, who was seen on video pleading that he couldn’t breathe with a white police officer pressing his knee into his neck for several minutes before Floyd stopped moving.Police in Las Vegas said Monday that 338 people were arrested during three nights of protests. Police said suspects were jailed despite a local court policy calling for most people accused of misdemeanors to receive court summons to prevent the spread of coronavirus.ST. LOUIS —Police say four officers were hit by gunfire after protests in St. Louis that started peacefully Monday became violent overnight, with demonstrators smashing windows and stealing items from businesses and fires burning in the downtown area.The police department tweeted early Tuesday that the officers were taken to a hospital with injuries that were not believed to be life-threatening. It was unclear who had fired the shots.The chaos in St. Louis followed continued protests Monday in Missouri over the death of George Floyd and police treatment of African Americans, with gatherings also held in Kansas City and Jefferson City.On Monday afternoon, several hundred people rallied peacefully outside the justice center in downtown St. Louis, including Mayor Lyda Krewson and St. Louis Public Safety Director Jimmie Edwards. Protestors later walked to the Gateway Arch National Park and then onto nearby Interstate 64.But later Monday, protesters gathered in front of police headquarters, where officers fired tear gas. Some protesters smashed windows at a downtown 7-11 store and stole items from inside before the building was set on fire. CICERO, Ill. — Authorities in a Chicago suburb where two people were fatally shot in unrest following George Floyd’s death are issuing fresh safety precautions Tuesday.Cicero officials cautioned residents to “stay home and stay off the streets” a day after violence and destruction erupted in the town of about 84,000 west of Chicago. Police say most of Monday’s chaos stemmed from residents trying to defend businesses. Roughly 60 people were arrested, mostly for burglary and weapons violations.Two men in their 20s were fatally shot around 6 p.m. in separate incidents related to the violent clashes.

I want you to look and the place where so many people are coming to grief. This is the intersection where George Floyd had that horrific encounter with police today. We're expecting his brother, Terrence Floyd, to come out for a prayer to lay some flowers. Theo idea is to focus on George Floyd and not on the violence. It is going to be a day of grieving and an emotional day for this community. It was another night of protest and unrest in cities across the country, with incidents of violence from New York City to Los Angeles. For the boss has been knocked down. The ones who cast that up no more because they don't have a voice anymore, all sparked by the killing of 46 year old George Floyd, who died in police custody pleading for his life as an officer. At least 40 cities have enacted nighttime curfews, and more than a dozen states have deployed the National Guard. But not all demonstrations have been violent. In Minneapolis, demonstrators gathering at the intersection with Floyd encountered police to remember the Minneapolis police chief also took a knee at the site and acknowledged Police needs to do better for community members. Need to know that the men and women that put this badge on that they're doing so in service to them and they should not, and they should not have to doubt. They should not have to doubt thean integrity and if they're gonna be treated in a compassionate and professional weight. And the police chief also saying that all four of those officers bear the same responsibility. It is, of course, a welcome message. But the protesters continue to say and continue to call for all four officers to be criminally charged. Reporting in Minneapolis, I'm Camila Bernau Back to you. Advertisement Officials see extremist groups stoking violence and disinformation during protests Share Shares Copy Link Copy U.S. officials sought to determine Sunday whether extremist groups had infiltrated police brutality protests across the country and deliberately tipped largely peaceful demonstrations toward violence — and if foreign adversaries were behind a burgeoning disinformation campaign on social media.As demonstrations spread from Minneapolis to the White House, New York City and overseas, federal law enforcement officials insisted far-left groups were stoking violence. Meanwhile, experts who track extremist groups also reported seeing evidence of the far-right at work.Investigators were also tracking online interference and looking into whether foreign agents were behind the effort. Officials have seen a surge of social media accounts with fewer than 200 followers created in the last month, a textbook sign of a disinformation effort.The accounts have posted graphic images of the protests, material on police brutality and material on the coronavirus pandemic that appeared designed to inflame tensions across the political divide, according to three administration officials. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss investigations.The investigations are an attempt to identify the network of forces behind some of the most widespread outbreak of civil unrest in the U.S. in decades. Protests erupted in dozens of cities in recent days, triggered by the death of George Floyd, who died after he was pinned at the neck by a white Minneapolis police officer. Pandemic-weary Americans were already angry — about COVID-19 deaths, lockdown orders and tens of millions of people out of work. The pandemic has hit African Americans harder than whites in the U.S., and the killings of black people by police have continued over the years even as the topic faded from the national stage. But there are signs of people with other disparate motives, including anarchist graffiti, arrests of some out-of-state protesters, and images circulating in extremist groups that suggest the involvement of outside groups.Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said Sunday that state authorities were hit with a cyber attack as law enforcement prepared to diffuse protests in Minneapolis and St. Paul, the epicenter of the unrest. He described it as a ""very sophisticated denial of service attack on all computers."" President Donald Trump, Attorney General William Bar and others have said the left-wing extremist group antifa is to blame. Short for anti-fascists, antifa is an umbrella term for far-left-leaning militant groups that resist neo-Nazis and white supremacists at demonstrations.Barr on Sunday said the FBI would use its regional joint terrorism task forces to ""identify criminal organizers,"" and Trump threatened again to name antifa a terrorist group.The Justice Department is also deploying members of the U.S. Marshals Service and agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration on Sunday to supplement National Guard troops outside the White House, a senior department official said. The official was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.The addition of the federal agents, who will have armored vehicles, came as Barr warned that prosecutors could seek to use terrorism statutes against ""violent radical agitators"" who attempt to hijack protests to cause destruction. An antifa activist group disseminated a message in a Telegram channel on Saturday that encouraged people to consider Minnesota National Guard troops ""easy targets,"" two Defense Department officials said. The message encouraged activists to steal ""kit,"" meaning the weapons and body armor used by the soldiers. The officials were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.As a result, soldiers with the Minnesota National Guard were armed during their mission at protests across the state Sunday, the officials said. The soldiers are sometimes armed but had not been since they moved into parts of the state that had been besieged by riots in the last few days. The troops do not have the authority to make arrests, and are there to act mostly as extra security for police.Others have seen evidence of right-wing extremists. J.J. MacNab, a fellow at George Washington University's Program on Extremism, has been monitoring chatter about the protests among anti-government extremists on social media platforms. She has access to dozens of private Facebook groups for followers of the loosely organized ""Boogaloo"" movement, which uses an '80s movie sequel as a code word for a second civil war.She also has been poring over images from the weekend protests and spotted some ""boogaloo bois"" in the crowds, carrying high-powered rifles and wearing tactical gear.""They want to co-opt them in order to start their war. They see themselves as being on the side of protesters and that the protesters themselves are useful in causing anarchy,"" MacNab said.She also sees signs that the Three Percenters militia movement appears to be taking an interest.Megan Squire, an Elon University computer science professor who tracks online extremism, saw images of at least four members of the far-right Proud Boys group on the periphery of a protest Saturday night in Raleigh, North Carolina.Trump was expected in the coming days to draw distinctions between the legitimate anger of peaceful protesters and the unacceptable actions of violent agitators, said a White House official who was not authorized to discuss the plans ahead of time and spoke on condition of anonymity.The Trump administration has largely remained silent on local reports that far-right protesters were also involved. Meanwhile, Democratic mayors said Trump's handling of the crisis was reminiscent of one of the darkest moments of his presidency — when he said there were ""good people on both sides"" of protests in 2017 over white supremacists demonstrating in Charlottesville, Virginia.America's racial fault lines are a perfect opportunity for foreign adversaries looking to sow discord and portray the U.S. in a negative light, according to James Ludes, director of the Pell Center for International Relations and Public Policy at Salve Regina University in Rhode Island.""This is a real issue and Americans are legitimately upset about it,"" said Ludes, who studies foreign disinformation tactics. ""That's one of the hallmarks of these campaigns. You don't create new issues, you exploit existing issues.""There's a history of this. In 2016, another black man, Philando Castile, was killed by police in a Minneapolis suburb, his death livestreamed on Facebook.Russians used a fake Black Lives Matter page to confuse and stoke anger among the protesters. There were nearly 700,000 followers, but it's not clear how many were real. One debunked example from this week: That Atlanta had deployed a ""child militia."" Floyd was accused of trying to pass a bad bill at a grocery store after he was laid off in the pandemic. Disturbing video showed him prone on the street, while a white police officer pressed his knee into Floyd's neck even as he cried he couldn't breathe. He later died. The officers have been fired; Derek Chauvin, the officer who pinned Floyd in the video, was charged with murder. At first there were peaceful demonstrations, but violence soon erupted. A Minneapolis police station was torched and protests took off around the country, growing increasingly tense. Video showed a police vehicle ramming into demonstrators in New York. Meanwhile, a van with four New York Police Department officers inside was hit with a Molotov cocktail and torched. Hundreds have been arrested nationwide and cities braced for more protests. But booking information from the county jail in Minneapolis, for example, showed that out of 59 protest-related arrests, 47 people had a home address in Minnesota, with the majority coming from the Twin Cities.Before protests began in New York City, organizers of anarchist groups began raising money for bail, recruited medical teams to deploy for violent interactions with police and planned how to target high-end stores, said John Miller, the NYPD's deputy commissioner of intelligence and counterterrorism. Scouts on bicycles would also move ahead of the groups to report where the police would be and then direct small breakaway groups to areas where they could torch police cars or throw Molotov cocktails, Miller said. The NYPD has arrested 786 people related to protests since May 28 and 1 in 7 of them were not from New York City, he said. In Washington, where protesters raged outside the White House, most of the 17 people arrested were from the area. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser said the groups seemed, at the least, organized to destroy with tools to break windows and distribute materials.",0.0

Organizers handed out bags of donation-funded supplies to help participants feel safer demonstrating during the pandemic. Protesters gathered Sunday evening on the westside of the University of New Mexico campus on Central Ave. with signs that read, “Black Lives Matter” and “White silence is violence.” The group chanted, “say his name: George Floyd” and “no justice, no peace, no racist police.” Organizer Hossanna Scott fundraised online to provide protesters with baggies of supplies, including PPE, water and snacks. She says she raised over $4,000 from community donations. “Mobilizing and organizing during a pandemic is a whole new thing, it’s a whole new ballpark,” said Scott. “But I just wanted people to feel safe. That’s the reason I got these masks, hand sanitizer, gloves on deck. Because, I just know it’ll be hard for some people, but I just want people to show up.” People showed up. The group eventually grew to thousands, marching along Route 66 to Downtown Albuquerque, where they gathered on a roundabout on 8th St. by Robinson Park for a moment of silence. Protesters then headed back up to the UNM area before marching to Albuquerque’s Civic Plaza, where speeches were given. Following that gathering, most protesters went home.

Later, after they were gone too, 100 or 200 people remained, most not in vehicles, breaking windows and looting. Riot police showed up, and the Albuquerque Police Department says someone fired on them in front of the KiMo Theatre. No injuries have been reported. At first, it was spiderwebbed windows on storefronts and graffiti, but around 12:30 in the morning at Third Street and Central, people smashed through some of those windows and started pulling things out of the businesses. Motorcycles and cars revved their engines. And businesses’ security alarms sounded. Looters pulled furniture from inside a club, sprayed fire extinguishers at the sky, lobbed glassware high into the air, and started a small fire in the street. Police helicopters circled. Riot police started forming, coming up Central, starting around 5th St. NW, telling everyone to leave. A helicopter above repeated the message through a loudspeaker. People threw things at police, and lit some dumpsters on fire, rolling them toward the line of riot officers, though none reached them. Another line of officers waited on 2nd St. NW. Police fired flash-bangs and rubber bullets, and launched tear gas, announcing they were going to take anyone who didn’t leave into custody. By 5 a.m., helicopters were still circling, and tear gas wafted out of downtown. At 6:45 a.m. Monday, KUNM's Marisa Demarco gave a live update from downtown Albuquerque, speaking with KUNM Morning Edition host, Nash Jones. Listen or read the transcript below. Live from downtown Albuquerque, 6:45 a.m. Monday. NASH JONES: I'm wondering what you're seeing. You're still downtown from last night's Black Lives Matter protest and a riot that occurred late into the night and potentially still happening now. What are you seeing? MARISA DEMARCO: Yeah, so right now, I mean, police have most of downtown completely blocked off. You can't really see most of the main part of the area where a lot of the violence and damage took place, which is on Central, so I'm standing on Copper now. I just kind of walked all the way around and police have blocked it off entirely. I did a little walking up Central until they told me to turn back, and you can still hear some of the alarms from the businesses going off. I'm seeing a lot of garbage trucks too, so I assume that they have the city's solid waste department out here cleaning things up. JONES: And how many people are you seeing besides the officers? DEMARCO: Besides officers? Oh, it's kind of hard to tell. There's some cars, there are some sparse cars. I think most of them are City of Albuquerque vehicles. So seems like maybe a lot of people are here pitching in on the cleanup. JONES: You've been out there most of the evening. Can you tell us a little bit about what you experienced last night? DEMARCO: Yeah, so I joined the Black Lives Matter protest and marched behind the protesters to film and to document and they got downtown and had speeches. And at that point, I would pretty much called that protest over. After that protest was done, people dispersed and went back to their cars. And then there were a lot of cars kind of driving around with signs hanging out their windows, but it still seemed somewhat peaceful, like there was like kids in the cars and stuff. And it wasn't until about one in the morning, maybe 12 or one, when people started breaking into businesses, pulling things out. They lit a small fire. The riot police approached from two sides, fired what I assume were less than lethal rounds and flashbangs I hear that in front of the KiMo [Theatre] someone fired shots on police; I think I was standing right there when it happened, and I don't really know if it if it was live ammo or something else, I have no idea. But things got really rowdy and smoky and aggressive and violent. People were throwing things. People were rolling fiery dumpsters at police like it was, it was rowdy. JONES: And you're saying that this was a separate thing, or it felt like a separate thing, from the protests that had happened earlier on in the evening? DEMARCO: Yeah, so I'm seeing a lot of headlines this morning that say like ‘Black Lives Matter protest erupts into violence.’ And that's really not the way that I was perceiving it last night. It felt like it was a long ways after the Black Lives Matter protest had concluded, and that now we were looking at something different.

Police Chief Rick Maglione did not defend the actions of Officer Steven Pohorence, but said Monday that Pohorence pushed the woman after he and other officers had just rescued one colleague who had become surrounded and another from a patrol car that people began jumping on. Maglione said Pohorence’s actions will be investigated by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement before an internal investigation is conducted. Maglione said he understands why some believe the shove provoked the crowd to throw bottles, but he said there were people in the crowd with bricks, bottles, fireworks and other weapons who were hoping to start a fight with officers. “I don’t think (Pohorence’s) action created what occurred,” the chief said. But he said Pohorence’s actions “could have added to what was going on,” and he commended Officer Krystle Smith who pushed Pohorence away from the woman. “She did what you are supposed to do: When you see either adrenaline or emotion or some kind of interaction going south … that is our job to do, is intervene,” he said. Police declined to make Smith available for an interview Monday. Fort Lauderdale Mayor Dean Trantalis said he felt the Pohorence’s actions were “offensive,” and he’s happy the department has suspended him. Demonstrator Samantha Sweeting Davis said she didn’t see the shove, but heard yelling, then saw about six police cars arrive with sirens on. Then she saw bottles being thrown at officers, heard an explosion, and tear gas burned her eyes and throat. It was upsetting to see that kind of behavior from an officer who is supposed to “protect and serve,” the 29-year-old high school counselor from Fort Lauderdale said. “Suspension is a great first step, but honestly I want to see the officer de-badged.” ADVERTISEMENTSkip ................................................................ The Fort Lauderdale Fraternal Order of Police, the union that represents the city’s officers, declined comment Monday. Meanwhile, the State Attorney’s Office in Broward County, fired prosecutor Amy Bloom for writing on Facebook: “Act civilized and maybe things will change. I’ve never seen such animals except at the zoo.” She said her description applied to protesters regardless of race. The South Florida Sun Sentinel reported Bloom quickly deleted the post, but someone copied it and it eventually reached her bosses. The State Attorney’s Office confirmed the firing in a statement, saying her views are “entirely inconsistent” with its “ideals and principles.” Bloom said Monday on Facebook that she realized the post could be misinterpreted, deleted it within seconds and that “I believe in justice for all and that ALL lives matter.” A curfew remains in effect in Broward County. Elsewhere in Florida, mostly peaceful protests were held over the weekend, but some Miami police cars were burned and storefronts damaged. That led Miami-Dade County Mayor Carlos Gimenez to postpone Monday’s reopening of the county’s beaches after a coronavirus shutdown. Gov. Ron DeSantis announced Monday that 700 national guard troops and 1,300 Florida Highway Patrol troopers are being deployed to help local law enforcement. “Florida has zero tolerance for violence, rioting and looting. George Floyd’s murder was appalling, and the Minnesota perpetrators need to be brought to justice, but this cannot be used as a pretext for violence in our Florida communities,” DeSantis said in a statement to media and on Twitter.

In Orlando, Police Chief Orlando Rolon said Monday that officers had to fire tear gas Sunday night after some demonstrators started throwing objects found at a highway construction site. He said his officers made 30 arrests Sunday night, including some who broke into stores.

Smaller, independent labels as well as music publishing companies and management firms have also signed on. UMG’s Interscope Geffen A&M Records said that in addition to joining Black Out Tuesday, the label home to Lady Gaga, Kendrick Lamar and Billie Eilish would not release music this week — the first label to do so. “Instead, IGA will contribute to organizations that help to bail out protesters exercising their right to peacefully assemble, aid lawyers working for systemic change and provide assistance to charities focused on creating economic empowerment in the Black community,” its statement read. IGA postponed new music releases MGK, 6lack, Dylan, Jessie Ware, Smokepurp, Lil Mosey, Billy Raffoul, Max Leone and more in coordination with their partners Alamo, LVRN, The Darkroom, Bad Boy and more. Musicians including Rihanna, Beyoncé, Taylor Swift, Lil Nas X, Demi Lovato, Post Malone and Harry Styles have spoken out on social media following Floyd’s death and the worldwide riots. Some musicians were spotted alongside crowds of protesters over the weekend, including Ariana Grande, J. Cole, Jamie Foxx, Chance the Rapper, Kehlani, Miguel, Tinashe, Lil Yachty and Halsey, who said she was hit with a pellet and a shrapnel shell in Los Angeles. LL Cool J turned to music to show his outrage and passion, posting a lengthy rap to social media. “For 400 years you had your knees on our necks, a garden of evil with no seeds of respect,” he rapped. “In America’s mirror all she sees is regret, instead of letting blood live they begging for blood let.” Jay-Z released a statement late Sunday calling for Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison to prosecute those responsible for killing Floyd, a handcuffed black man who pleaded for air as a white police officer pressed a knee on his neck. “I, along with an entire country in pain, call upon AG Ellison to do the right thing and prosecute all those responsible for the murder of George Floyd to the fullest extent of the law. This is just a first step. I am more determined to fight for justice than any fight my would-be oppressors may have,” Jay-Z said. “I prevail on every politician, prosecutor and officer in the country to have the courage to do what is right. Have the courage to look at us as humans, dads, brothers, sisters and mothers in pain and look at yourselves.” Racial tensions were also running high after two white men were arrested in May in the February shooting death of black jogger Arbery in Georgia, and after Louisville, Kentucky, police shot Taylor to death in her home in March. The R&B duo Chloe x Halle was originally set to release their sophomore album, “Ungodly Hour,” on Friday. They told the AP on Monday that will release the album at other time. The singers also posted a cover of the classic civil rights anthem and protest song “We Shall Overcome” to Instagram, hoping to offer the world some positive energy. “This week has been very heavy for all of us. We’ve been trying to, not understand, because there’s no way to understand the terrible killings — we just have heavy hearts this week and are just trying to do everything we can to pray and lift each other up with our voices,” Halle said in an interview with The Associated Press on Friday. “With everything going on, we felt like music can be very healing, because it’s been that way for us in kind of keeping us sane during this time,” Chloe added.

The chaos in St. Louis followed continued protests Monday in Missouri over the death of George Floyd and police treatment of African Americans, with gatherings also held in Kansas City and Jefferson City. On Monday afternoon, several hundred people rallied peacefully outside the justice center in downtown St. Louis, including Mayor Lyda Krewson and St. Louis Public Safety Director Jimmie Edwards. Protestors later walked to the Gateway Arch National Park and then onto nearby Interstate 64. But later Monday, protesters gathered in front of police headquarters, where officers fired tear gas. Some protesters smashed windows at a downtown 7-11 store and stole items from inside before the building was set on fire. ___ NEW YORK — New York City imposed a late-night curfew Monday that failed to prevent another night of destruction, including arrests after a break-in at the iconic Macy’s store on 34th Street, following protests over George Floyd’s death. As the 11 p.m. deadline to get off the streets approached, bands of protesters marched peacefully through Manhattan and Brooklyn, but police simultaneously responded to numerous reports of roving groups of people smashing their way into shops and emptying them of merchandise. The doors of Macy’s flagship Manhattan store were breached. Police pulled two handcuffed men out and put them in a van.

Video posted on social media showed some protesters arguing with people breaking windows, urging them to stop, but instances of vandalism and smash-and-grab thefts mounted as the night deepened. New York joined other cities around the country in imposing a curfew after days of unrest. It comes on top of months of restrictions on public gatherings already imposed because of the coronavirus pandemic. Enough mayhem happened before the curfew took effect that Mayor Bill de Blasio tweeted that it would move up to 8 p.m. Tuesday. The curfew lifts at 5 a.m. ___ BIRMINGHAM, Ala. — Workers in Alabama’s largest city began removing a Confederate monument Monday night after demonstrators failed to knock down the obelisk the night before. Birmingham Mayor Randall Woodfin sent workers with heavy equipment to take down the more than 50-foot-tall Confederate monument made of stone. Late on Monday, after a 7 p.m. curfew took effect and streets were mostly clear, crews began their work.

Protesters began running and military-style vehicles could later be seen occupying the key square fronting a courthouse complex.

A similar scene played out the night before. ___ LOUISVILLE, Ky. — The fatal shooting of the popular owner of a Louisville barbecue spot has prompted a massive march to the site where the restaurateur was killed early Monday. David McAtee died while police officers and National Guard soldiers were enforcing a curfew amid waves of protests in the Kentucky city. Mayor Greg Fischer revealed earlier Monday that police officers lacked body camera video for the investigation.

As the National Guard began moving, Tennessee State Police grabbed batons and formed a line behind them. However, the crowd remained calm. Democratic lawmakers leaving the Capitol asked to be able to move past the line of guards to join the crowd.

Justice. When do we want it? Now.” They applauded as they rose to their feet and declared that the streets were theirs. Over the past few nights, demonstrators protesting the death of George Floyd in Minnesota had asked black police officers to take a knee to show their support. The march Monday night was peaceful as nightfall approached. There was no apparent effort to get protesters off the streets even though a 7 p.m. curfew had passed. Earlier, law enforcement officers on horseback and foot aggressively pushed the protesters away from Lafayette Park near the White House so President Donald Trump could visit a church that was damaged by fire during the protests Sunday night.

The demonstrators passed the Lincoln and World War II Memorials and the Washington Monument on the Mall before heading back to the streets near the White House. There was no apparent attempt to disburse the protesters even though a 7 p.m. curfew had passed. At Farragut Square, a few blocks from the White House, there were about two law enforcement officers for every civilian. Multiple helicopters buzzed overhead, a relative rarity in the District of Columbia, which is normally a no-fly zone for helicopters and drones. ___ BIRMINGHAM, Ala. — Heavy equipment arrived Monday night at the Birmingham park where protesters tried but failed to topple a more than 50-foot-tall Confederate monument made of stone Sunday. It could be the first step toward removing the obelisk. Mayor Randall Woodfin has vowed to remove the monument, which was at the center of a court fight between the city and state over an Alabama law protecting rebel memorials. ___ OLYMPIA, Wash. — Washington Gov. Jay Inslee on Monday evening slammed President Donald Trump’s threat to deploy the United States military to American cities to quell a rise of violent protests. In an emailed statement in response to the president’s comments, the Democrat said Trump “has repeatedly proven he is incapable of governing and shown nothing but false bravado throughout the chaos that has accompanied his time in office.” “He cowers at the feet of authoritarians around the world,” Inslee said. “Now he uses the most supreme power of the presidency in a desperate attempt to hide his timidity and vapidity. I pray no soldier and no civilian is injured or killed by this reckless fit.” The Seattle area has seen several days of violence, including vandalism in the city’s downtown core. ___ PORTLAND, Ore. — Oregon Gov. Kate Brown says she won’t send National Guard troops to actively help quell violent protests in Portland over the killing of George Floyd because they aren’t needed and that “is exactly what President Trump wants.” At a Monday news conference, Brown said she would send 100 state police from around Oregon to assist the city, and activate 50 Guard troops to work in support and behind the scenes. Earlier in the day, President Donald Trump slammed many governors as “weak” and demanded tougher crackdowns on burning and stealing among some demonstrations. Trump spoke to governors via video teleconference. Brown said having National Guard soldiers on the streets was the wrong way to go. “You don’t defuse violence by putting soldiers on the streets,” the Democrat said. “Trump wants governors to deploy the national guard to intimidate the public.” Portland remains under a curfew order that takes effect at 8 p.m. nightly. Police arrested 11 adults during protests Sunday and early Monday morning after authorities said projectiles — including “large, industrial grade mortar-type fireworks” — were thrown at officers. “Having soldiers on the streets of America is exactly what President Trump wants,” Brown said. ___ Former boxing champion Floyd Mayweather has offered to pay for George Floyd’s funeral and memorial services, and the family has accepted the offer. Mayweather personally has been in touch with the family, according to Leonard Ellerbe, the CEO of Mayweather Promotions. He will handle costs for the funeral on June 9 in Floyd’s hometown of Houston, as well as other expenses. TMZ originally reported Mayweather’s offer. “He’ll probably get mad at me for saying that, but yes, he is definitely paying for the funeral,” Ellerbe told ESPN.com on Monday. Floyd, a black man, died May 25 after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck while Floyd was handcuffed and saying that he couldn’t breathe. His death sparked protests in Minneapolis and around the country, some of which became violent. ___ WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump is visiting the 200-year-old church near the White House that was set on fire as demonstrators clashed with police over the weekend. Beginning with James Madison, every person who has held the office of president has attended a service at St. John’s Church. Law enforcement cleared protesters out of the area with tear gas before Trump’s visit. Tear gas canisters could be heard exploding as Trump spoke in the Rose Garden. He then walked over to the church. The protesters appeared to be acting peacefully before they were dispersed by force. Trump is urging the nation’s governors to get tougher with violent protesters and to deploy the National Guard. He said in the Rose Garden that he is an ally of peaceful protesters, but he stressed that “I am your president of law and order.” ___ PHILADELPHIA — Police fired non-lethal bullets and tear gas at hundreds of protesters who spilled onto an interstate highway in the heart of Philadelphia on Monday just before a 6 p.m. curfew took effect. The crowds on Interstate 676 also led to the closure of the Benjamin Franklin Bridge, the main link from downtown Philadelphia to New Jersey suburbs across the Delaware River. Some climbed a steep embankment and scaled a fence as police acted.

But he wrote in a post Monday on Medium that the ""the small minority of folks who've resorted to violence"" at many demonstrations are ""putting innocent people at risk, compounding the destruction of neighborhoods that are often already short on services and investment and detracting from the larger cause."" He recounted seeing an interview, where he said, ""I saw an elderly black woman being interviewed today in tears because the only grocery store in her neighborhood had been trashed. If history is any guide, that store may take years to come back. So let's not excuse violence, or rationalize it, or participate in it."" The country's first African American president weighed in after the nation experienced a sixth night of protests — which in some cities turned violent — following the death of Floyd, a black man, after being kneeled on by at least one Minneapolis officer, who has been charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. The Democrat, who often admonishes people to vote, said that ""we should be fighting to make sure that we have a president, a Congress, a U.S. Justice Department, and a federal judiciary that actually recognize the ongoing, corrosive role that racism plays in our society and want to do something about it."" But he wrote that the officials ""who matter most in reforming police departments and the criminal justice system"" work at the state and local levels. Mayors and county executives, Obama wrote, appoint police chiefs and negotiate with police unions, while district attorneys and state's attorneys ""decide whether or not to investigate and ultimately charge those involved in police misconduct."" All are elected positions, Obama said, which usually suffer from ""pitifully low"" voter turnout, ""especially among young people — which makes no sense given the direct impact these offices have on social justice issues, not to mention the fact that who wins and who loses those seats is often determined by just a few thousand, or even a few hundred, votes."" Obama established a task force on ""21st-century policing"" in 2014 after Michael Brown's shooting death by police in Ferguson Mo., which led to violence there. Many police and criminal justice reforms outlined by Obama and his Justice Department have been abandoned during the Trump administration. President Trump has called Floyd's death a ""grave tragedy"" and urged state and local governments to take aggressive action to quell any violent unrest. ",0.0

If we want our criminal justice system, and American society at large, to operate on a higher ethical code, then we have to model that code ourselves,"" Obama wrote in an essay on Medium.He added, ""The bottom line is this: if we want to bring about real change, then the choice isn't between protest and politics. We have to do both. We have to mobilize to raise awareness, and we have to organize and cast our ballots to make sure that we elect candidates who will act on reform.""Related video: Two officers fired after street protest arrestsIn his statement on Friday, Obama called for officials in Minnesota to bring justice in Floyd's death.""It falls on all of us, regardless of our race or station — including the majority of men and women in law enforcement who take pride in doing their tough job the right way, every day — to work together to create a 'new normal' in which the legacy of bigotry and unequal treatment no longer infects our institutions or our hearts,"" Obama said at the time.",0.0

1622570376,2020-06-01 14:39:00,Biden Meets With Black Faith Leaders In Delaware Following Days Of Protest,https://www.krwg.org/post/biden-meets-black-faith-leaders-delaware-following-days-protest,en,False,,214420,krwg.org,http://krwg.org/,"In his first in-person campaign event in more than two months, presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden met Monday with community leaders at a predominantly African American church in his hometown to address the outrage and protests surrounding George Floyd's death. Protests have erupted in dozens of cities over the past week since Floyd, a black man, died after a police officer was seen on video with his knee on Floyd's neck for minutes on end. ""I think the public is getting to a place that it's never been before in understanding a lot of this,"" Biden said at the event. ""But it's going to take a whole hell of a lot of hard work. A lot of hard work. But I'm confident it can be done."" Fourteen faith leaders and local lawmakers attended the event at Bethel AME church in Wilmington, Del., as they donned masks and sat seated two to a pew to help maintain social distancing due to the coronavirus. Biden spent more than half of the event listening to the concerns of community leaders rather than delivering remarks. He could be seen taking notes as each attendee got up and spoke. Despite being in a room full of supporters, the group offered critical feedback to the former vice president, with some saying the black community didn't get the economic boost it needed under the Obama administration and that Biden's role in passing the 1994 crime bill makes some young black voters skeptical of him. There were recommendations to create a czar dedicated solely to the study of police brutality within Biden's first 100 days as president. Several speakers urged Biden to pick an African American woman as his vice president. U.S. Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester, D-Del., spoke emotionally of a recent exchange she had with a 23-year-old protester in Wilmington, who told her he was ""willing to die."" ""He said, 'I have so much rage.' And I said, 'How old are you? What's your name? How old are you?' And I just tried to hold him, COVID or not,"" the congresswoman said. After about an hour, Biden rose to address the church gathering. ""I want to make something clear: I don't expect anything from the black community,"" he said. ""It has to be earned, earned every single time."" Biden said he's spent time speaking with black thought leaders about how to move forward as a country and said people who ""don't think of themselves as having a prejudiced bone in their body"" are now reckoning with the discrimination endemic in some American institutions. ""The Band-Aid's been ripped off by this pandemic and this president. No one can pretend any longer what this is all about. Nobody can pretend who has been carrying us on our backs — it's the minorities,"" Biden said. Biden listed specific plans for his would-be administration, including heightened federal oversight over local law enforcement, additional training for police officers and increased economic opportunity for African Americans. He teased the announcement of a new economic proposal in the coming weeks, which he said will have a strong emphasis on housing, education and access to capital. ""The ultimate answer for every other group has been access to economic opportunity,"" Biden said. ""What is the future? The future is you gotta be able to get out of bed and think, 'I can make it, I can do something. The deck's not completely stacked.' "" He also stressed what he characterized as a critical need to change leadership in the Senate, particularly as it relates to confirming federal judges. ""If we don't win back the United States Senate, we're going to be in real trouble,"" Biden said. ""Presidents come and go. But I tell you what, justices don't. They last a long time."" The event ended with a prayer and Biden saying he'll rely on the group for advice throughout his campaign. ""I know I'm going to make mistakes,"" he said before quoting the expression, ""What comes from the heart goes straight to the heart."" ""It's going to come from the heart. But I'll need help,"" the former vice president said. ""I need help and advice as we go along as to what you think I should and shouldn't be doing."" The event marked Biden's third public appearance in a week, his first trips away from his home since mid-March. He has been campaigning from his house due to coronavirus lockdown orders. Biden left his home on Memorial Day to lay a wreath at a veterans park near his home, and on Sunday he visited a site in Wilmington where protesters had gathered the night before in response to Floyd's death. Biden held a virtual meeting with mayors later in the day and had virtual fundraisers planned for Monday evening. ",0.0

Or Participate In It',https://www.kunm.org/post/former-president-obama-lets-not-excuse-violence-or-participate-it,en,False,,146446,kunm.org,http://kunm.org/,"Former President Barack Obama said the protests in cities across the nation in the aftermath of George Floyd's death in Minneapolis under a police officer's knee ""represent a genuine and legitimate frustration over a decades-long failure to reform police practices and the broader criminal justice system in the United States."" But he wrote in a post Monday on Medium that the ""the small minority of folks who've resorted to violence"" at many demonstrations are ""putting innocent people at risk, compounding the destruction of neighborhoods that are often already short on services and investment and detracting from the larger cause."" He recounted seeing an interview, where he said, ""I saw an elderly black woman being interviewed today in tears because the only grocery store in her neighborhood had been trashed. If history is any guide, that store may take years to come back. So let's not excuse violence, or rationalize it, or participate in it."" The country's first African American president weighed in after the nation experienced a sixth night of protests — which in some cities turned violent — following the death of Floyd, a black man, after being kneeled on by at least one Minneapolis officer, who has been charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. The Democrat, who often admonishes people to vote, said that ""we should be fighting to make sure that we have a president, a Congress, a U.S. Justice Department, and a federal judiciary that actually recognize the ongoing, corrosive role that racism plays in our society and want to do something about it."" But he wrote that the officials ""who matter most in reforming police departments and the criminal justice system"" work at the state and local levels. Mayors and county executives, Obama wrote, appoint police chiefs and negotiate with police unions, while district attorneys and state's attorneys ""decide whether or not to investigate and ultimately charge those involved in police misconduct."" All are elected positions, Obama said, which usually suffer from ""pitifully low"" voter turnout, ""especially among young people — which makes no sense given the direct impact these offices have on social justice issues, not to mention the fact that who wins and who loses those seats is often determined by just a few thousand, or even a few hundred, votes."" Obama established a task force on ""21st-century policing"" in 2014 after Michael Brown's shooting death by police in Ferguson Mo., which led to violence there. Many police and criminal justice reforms outlined by Obama and his Justice Department have been abandoned during the Trump administration. President Trump has called Floyd's death a ""grave tragedy"" and urged state and local governments to take aggressive action to quell any violent unrest. ",0.0

Biden spent more than half of the event listening to the concerns of community leaders rather than delivering remarks. He could be seen taking notes as each attendee got up and spoke. Despite being in a room full of supporters, the group offered critical feedback to the former vice president, with some saying the black community didn't get the economic boost it needed under the Obama administration and that Biden's role in passing the 1994 crime bill makes some young black voters skeptical of him. There were recommendations to create a czar dedicated solely to the study of police brutality within Biden's first 100 days as president. Several speakers urged Biden to pick an African American woman as his vice president. U.S. Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester, D-Del., spoke emotionally of a recent exchange she had with a 23-year-old protester in Wilmington, who told her he was ""willing to die."" ""He said, 'I have so much rage.' And I said, 'How old are you? What's your name? How old are you?' And I just tried to hold him, COVID or not,"" the congresswoman said. After about an hour, Biden rose to address the church gathering. ""I want to make something clear: I don't expect anything from the black community,"" he said. ""It has to be earned, earned every single time."" Biden said he's spent time speaking with black thought leaders about how to move forward as a country and said people who ""don't think of themselves as having a prejudiced bone in their body"" are now reckoning with the discrimination endemic in some American institutions. ""The Band-Aid's been ripped off by this pandemic and this president. No one can pretend any longer what this is all about. Nobody can pretend who has been carrying us on our backs — it's the minorities,"" Biden said. Biden listed specific plans for his would-be administration, including heightened federal oversight over local law enforcement, additional training for police officers and increased economic opportunity for African Americans. He teased the announcement of a new economic proposal in the coming weeks, which he said will have a strong emphasis on housing, education and access to capital. ""The ultimate answer for every other group has been access to economic opportunity,"" Biden said. ""What is the future? The future is you gotta be able to get out of bed and think, 'I can make it, I can do something. The deck's not completely stacked.' "" He also stressed what he characterized as a critical need to change leadership in the Senate, particularly as it relates to confirming federal judges. ""If we don't win back the United States Senate, we're going to be in real trouble,"" Biden said. ""Presidents come and go. But I tell you what, justices don't. They last a long time."" The event ended with a prayer and Biden saying he'll rely on the group for advice throughout his campaign. ""I know I'm going to make mistakes,"" he said before quoting the expression, ""What comes from the heart goes straight to the heart."" ""It's going to come from the heart. But I'll need help,"" the former vice president said. ""I need help and advice as we go along as to what you think I should and shouldn't be doing."" The event marked Biden's third public appearance in a week, his first trips away from his home since mid-March. He has been campaigning from his house due to coronavirus lockdown orders. Biden left his home on Memorial Day to lay a wreath at a veterans park near his home, and on Sunday he visited a site in Wilmington where protesters had gathered the night before in response to Floyd's death. Biden held a virtual meeting with mayors later in the day and had virtual fundraisers planned for Monday evening. ",0.0

DALLAS — When President Donald Trump demanded Monday that governors get tougher in cracking down on violence among some demonstrations, he cited Dallas protesters badly beating a man this weekend. But the president’s comments left out what police suggest sparked the incident to which he seemed to be referring — the man swinging a machete at protesters. And the man was last reported to be in stable condition, contrary to Trump suggesting he may have died. During a video-conference call with state leaders, law enforcement officers and national security officials, Trump told the governors they need to “dominate” or else wind up looking like “jerks.” ADVERTISEMENTSkip ................................................................ “I saw what happened in Dallas, where they kicked a guy to death. I don’t know if he died or not, but if he didn’t it’s a miracle. What they did to him, they were kicking him like I’ve never seen anything like it in my life,” Trump said. “People don’t talk about that. They don’t talk about that. They’re talking about a lot of other things, but they don’t talk about that. But I saw what happened in Dallas. Those kids, they’re all on camera. They’re wise guys. It’s coming from the radical left. You know it, everybody knows it.” The comments appear to refer to graphic videos of a man being beaten in Dallas Saturday that circulated widely on social media. One video posted to Twitter by a reporter for Blaze TV was viewed more than 33 million times. Dallas police said that man was alive Sunday and in stable condition at a hospital but that they don’t provide updates on victims’ health unless they die. Witnesses told investigators the attack began when the man “came to the protest wielding a large knife/machete at several protesters,” according to police Sgt. Warren Mitchell. He had the machete to “allegedly protect his neighborhood from protesters,” Mitchell said. One protester tried to fight the man off with a skateboard and managed to disarm him but also had his hand cut, Mitchell said. The video starts with protesters throwing things at a man carrying a long object. He then raises it, runs at a protester carrying a skateboard and someone is heard screaming. The camera is briefly obscured. Moments later, it focuses on a group of people punching and kicking the man. One person appears to throw a stone, striking him in the head. The group then clears away, leaving the man’s twisted body bleeding in the street. No one has been charged in the incident. Neither the man who was carrying the machete nor the protester who was cut on the hand has filed a complaint, Mitchell said Monday. ADVERTISEMENTSkip ................................................................ Trump seemed to reference the beating again Monday night during remarks from the White House in the Rose Garden. “A number of state and local governments have failed to take necessary action to safeguard their residents,” Trump said. “Innocent people have been savagely beaten, like the young man in Dallas, Texas, who was left dying on the street, or the woman in upstate New York viciously attacked by dangerous thugs.” In Austin, authorities said a 20-year-old black protester was in critical condition after a police officer firing a beanbag round at someone else missed, striking the victim in the head. Austin Police Chief Brian Manley said Monday the intended target was fired on after hurling a water bottle and backpack toward officers Sunday night. But he said the round missed and struck the person standing next to him, causing the man to fall and apparently land on his head outside police headquarters. Manley said the man who was struck was “fighting for their life.” “I’m crushed,” Manley said. “That is not what we set out to do as a police department. That was not what we set out to do this weekend.” ___ Associated Press reporters Paul J. Weber in Austin and Nomaan Merchant in Houston contributed to this story.",0.0

Michelle Lujan Grisham on Monday issued the following statement: “I want to wholeheartedly commend the thousands of New Mexicans who peacefully protested in Albuquerque last night. Freedom of speech is an undeniable right of every American and every New Mexican, and in moments of crisis, in expressing anger at long-standing injustice and racism, that right is all the more important. These protesters were part of an exemplary demonstration. “Later in the night, a small group took a wrong turn, and this is greatly concerning. We have received reports of shots fired at or in the direction of public safety officers – and this is flatly unacceptable. That sort of behavior is an attempt to distort the important work of the peaceful protesters – who have every right to demonstrate in peace – and puts both the protesters and public safety officers at risk. Those individuals, I have complete confidence, will be held accountable. There is no place in this moment for hijacking the protesters’ message of justice and non-violence. “The president’s comments this morning were a dangerous step in this wrong direction. His effort to militarize the response to these protests will only serve to inflame the feelings of anger and injustice – and will give rise to additional opportunity for violence and chaos. I unequivocally reject his notion that physical or military force is the only worthwhile or effective response to these protests. “The state of New Mexico will stand ready to assist local governments in facilitating peaceful protests. These protesters are giving voice to powerful and deep feelings about the unacceptable inequity and injustice woven into this country; their stand against racism is a worthy one; and I encourage them to continue demonstrating in a peaceful and safe fashion, remembering the urgent health risks of this moment. Lastly it is essential that I underscore the importance of not allowing that message to be distorted by the harmful actions of a few bad actors.”",0.0

Police have cited concerns over the spread of the coronavirus. The rally has been held each year since 1990 to commemorate the lives lost in the June 4, 1989, crackdown in Beijing's Tiananmen Square. The Chinese military opened fire on citizens who were calling for economic and democratic reforms. The Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements of China, which organized the vigil, told the South China Morning Post that alliance members still planned to enter Victoria Park to observe a moment of silence that night. The alliance also asked the public to join an online gathering and light candles across the city. NPR's Emily Feng reported that the move to deny the demonstration comes amid controversy surrounding China's proposed national security law that could limit Hong Kong's autonomy. The potential law has concerned pro-democracy advocates, and as Feng noted, ""Legal scholars question whether Beijing has the authority to impose this law on Hong Kong."" In justifying an earlier extension of restrictions to June 4, police cited a lingering threat of the spread of the coronavirus, The Guardian reported. ""Police believe the event will not only increase participants' chances of contracting the virus, but also threaten citizens' lives and health, thus endangering public safety and affecting the rights of others,"" police said, according to the newspaper. Lee Cheuk-yan, who chairs the alliance that organized the event, told the South China Morning Post that he believes the government was using the pandemic to shut down the demonstration.

Those sparks have landed in a tinderbox assembled over decades of economic inequality, now made worse by the coronavirus pandemic. Minneapolis police officers initially confronted the man — George Floyd — on suspicion that he'd used a counterfeit $20 bill to buy cigarettes. The viral video of what followed captured an individual tragedy. But it's set against a backdrop of poverty and discrimination that have long colored relations between law enforcement and the African American community. African Americans are worse off than whites by almost every economic measure. And that divide has only deepened during the pandemic that's sent the country into its worst economic downturn in generations. A survey by the Federal Reserve last year found that even in good times, African Americans are less able to pay their monthly bills than whites or Latinos. That's hardly surprising, since median income among African Americans is 41% lower than that of non-Hispanic whites. Blacks are also 40% less likely to own their homes than whites — depriving many African American families of an opportunity to build wealth. The gap in homeownership is particularly stark in Minneapolis. A study by Zillow, the online real estate company, found black homeownership in the city lags more than 50 percentage points below the white rate. ""It tells us that there's racism baked in to the housing market,"" said Andre Perry, a fellow at the Brookings Institution and author of Know Your Price: Valuing Black Lives and Property in America's Black Cities. Income disparity, segregation, and racial redlining have all contributed to low national levels of homeownership among African Americans. Although blacks made housing gains in the 1990s and early 2000s, that was reversed by the subprime mortgage crisis, which led to a wave of foreclosures. Before the pandemic struck, African Americans were enjoying a strong job market. The black unemployment rate in February was 5.8% — near a 50-year low, though still higher than the white rate. Since then, unemployment for all racial groups has soared to double-digits. But the black-white gap has not noticeably worsened. Loading... African Americans who are working, however, are more likely to hold jobs that put them at risk of infection. A survey by the Labor Department found that in 2018, less than 20% of African Americans held jobs they could do from home, compared to about 30% of whites. Higher risk of on-the-job exposure to the coronavirus is compounded by African Americans' higher rates of diabetes, heart disease and other conditions that are thought to contribute to more severe cases of COVID-19. ""There have been epidemics in the black community that have existed for generations before COVID,"" Perry said. ""COVID accentuated and exposed those epidemics."" Just as the pandemic puts unequal health outcomes under a microscope, the video of George Floyd's last moments illuminates the frustration brought about by generations of economic hardship. Four police officers have been fired over the incident. One — Derek Chauvin — has been charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Chauvin is shown pressing his knee against Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes. ""That action really symbolized the knee on the neck of black homeowners and renters,"" Perry said. ""It represents the employers who don't provide the kind of benefits and wages that will lift African American communities."" He suggested the demonstrations taking place across the country, five months before a national election, provide an opportunity for candidates to spell out how they would deal with these challenges. ""If we don't address the structural inequality,"" Perry said, ""we'll be right back in the same place when the next inevitable crisis hits."" : 6/03/20 A previous version of this Web story incorrectly said all four police officers present at the death of George Floyd are white. Copyright 2020 NPR. To see more, visit https://www.npr.org. AILSA CHANG, HOST: The viral video that sparked nationwide protests this weekend captured an individual tragedy - the death of a black man at the hands of police officers in Minneapolis. But George Floyd's death is set against a backdrop of economic inequality that has long shadowed race relations in this country. We're going to talk about that now for a few minutes with NPR's Scott Horsley. Hi, Scott. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Hi, Ailsa. CHANG: So we've been hearing an enormous amount of frustration in the last week about yet another black man dying in police custody. Can you just break down for us how economics plays into that frustration? HORSLEY: There is certainly frustration with the deadly tactics of police. But there's also frustration about the underlying circumstances that in the richest country on Earth, a man could lose his life because he's suspected of passing a counterfeit 20-dollar bill. We know that African Americans are worse off than whites in this country by almost every economic measure. Andre Perry, who studies race and inequality at the Brookings Institution, says that means blacks in general are more vulnerable to any kind of economic downturn. ANDRE PERRY: Black folk live in communities where a single economic shock can really send the entire economic hopes astray. HORSLEY: And, of course, right now, we're all living through a giant economic shock of the coronavirus pandemic. CHANG: Right. HORSLEY: People throughout the country are on edge. And that has just added more dry kindling to the woodpile where this match has landed. CHANG: Well, about the pandemic - I mean, we know that African Americans have suffered disproportionate health problems during this entire outbreak. But economically, how are they faring, relatively speaking, during this time? HORSLEY: Not well. Of course, workers of all races have seen a spike in unemployment during the pandemic. The black unemployment rate has jumped into double digits, as have other rates. But the black-white gap hasn't gotten noticeably worse during the last couple of months. CHANG: Interesting. HORSLEY: We do know, however, African Americans who are working are more likely to be in essential frontline jobs. And that puts them at greater risk of infection. CHANG: So how does Minneapolis, where this all started, stack up when it comes to inequality or when it comes to discrimination? HORSLEY: The racial divide in Minneapolis is pretty stark both in terms of income and homeownership. In fact, the gap between white and black homeownership in Minneapolis is one of the largest in the country. And that matters because for a lot of families, owning a home is the main building block of wealth and stability. If blacks aren't able to buy homes, they're missing out on an important stepping stone. Nationwide, African Americans did make some gains in homeownership in the '90s and early 2000s. But those were really wiped out by the subprime mortgage crisis. And Andre Perry says that kind of structural inequality feeds into the frustration of the people who are protesting George Floyd's death. PERRY: That action really symbolized the knee on the neck of black homeowners and renters. It represents the employers who don't provide the kind of benefits and wages that will lift African American communities. HORSLEY: Now, Perry notes these demonstrations are taking place five months before a national election. And he says this is a good opportunity for policymakers to talk about how they see policing and how they would address these longstanding economic challenges. CHANG: That is NPR's Scott Horsley. Thank you, Scott. HORSLEY: You're welcome. Transcript provided by NPR, Copyright NPR.",0.0

But some health experts, even as they urge caution, said they support the demonstrations — because racism also poses a dire health threat. Tens of thousands of people, masked and unmasked, have thronged the streets of Minneapolis, Atlanta, Louisville, Ky., and other cities in the week since George Floyd died after a white Minneapolis police officer kneeled on his neck. They are the largest public gatherings in the U.S. since the pandemic forced widespread shutdowns, and many local officials warned of a possible spike in new cases in one or two weeks. ""Risk of transmission is lower in open spaces, but wherever there is a gathering there is still the risk of transmitting the virus,"" said Dr. Elaine Nsoesie, an assistant professor of global health at Boston University. Health experts urged protesters not to sing and shout to reduce the threat of person-to-person transmission. And they cautioned that police tactics such as tear gas and pepper spray could exacerbate the situation by prompting people to cough and gasp for air. The New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene issued a list of tips for demonstrators to lower their risk of contracting COVID-19, such as covering their faces and staying in small groups. ""Don't yell; use signs & noise makers instead,"" the department advised. Nsoesie said that while she agrees with the sentiment, ""I can see how some of these tips can be difficult to follow. For example, if you are angry or frustrated about an issue, you want to express that feeling, and speaking is one way of doing that."" She added, ""It's also hard to keep 6 feet of distance at a protest."" Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser said she's worried about how consecutive days of protests could trigger an influx of COVID-19 cases. Huge demonstrations began in the nation's capital on Friday — the same day Bowser lifted stay-at-home orders and eased shutdown rules. The city is still limiting gatherings to no more than 10 people. But in the streets around the White House, that cap is regularly exceeded by orders of magnitude. ""I'm so concerned about it that I'm urging everybody to consider their exposure if they need to isolate from their family members when they go home and if they need to be tested, because we have worked very hard to blunt the curve,"" Bowser said on NBC's Meet the Press. But the risks of congregating during a global pandemic shouldn't keep people from protesting racism, according to dozens of public health and disease experts who signed an open letter in support of the protests. ""White supremacy is a lethal public health issue that predates and contributes to COVID-19,"" the letter said. Initially written by infectious disease experts at the University of Washington, the letter cited a number of systemic problems, from the disproportionately high rate at which black people have been killed by police in the U.S. to disparities in life expectancy and other vital categories — including black Americans' higher death rate from the coronavirus. ""Data is showing that blacks and Latinos have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19 in many states,"" said Nsoesie, who was not among the letter's signatories when NPR contacted her. ""Racism is one of the reasons this disparity exists."" She continued, ""Racism is a social determinant of health. It affects the physical and mental health of blacks in the U.S. So I wouldn't weigh these crises separately."" Local governments should not break up crowded demonstrations ""under the guise of maintaining public health,"" the experts said in their open letter. They urged law enforcement agencies not to use tear gas, smoke and other irritants, saying they could make people more susceptible to infection and worsen existing health conditions. The medical professionals also acknowledged the potential for COVID-19 cases to rise in the days to come, and they called for public health agencies to boost access to care and testing in affected communities.

Police have cited concerns over the spread of the coronavirus. The rally has been held each year since 1990 to commemorate the lives lost in the June 4, 1989, crackdown in Beijing's Tiananmen Square. The Chinese military opened fire on citizens who were calling for economic and democratic reforms. The Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements of China, which organized the vigil, told the South China Morning Post that alliance members still planned to enter Victoria Park to observe a moment of silence that night. The alliance also asked the public to join an online gathering and light candles across the city. NPR's Emily Feng reported that the move to deny the demonstration comes amid controversy surrounding China's proposed national security law that could limit Hong Kong's autonomy. The potential law has concerned pro-democracy advocates, and as Feng noted, ""Legal scholars question whether Beijing has the authority to impose this law on Hong Kong."" In justifying an earlier extension of restrictions to June 4, police cited a lingering threat of the spread of the coronavirus, The Guardian reported. ""Police believe the event will not only increase participants' chances of contracting the virus, but also threaten citizens' lives and health, thus endangering public safety and affecting the rights of others,"" police said, according to the newspaper. Lee Cheuk-yan, who chairs the alliance that organized the event, told the South China Morning Post that he believes the government was using the pandemic to shut down the demonstration. ""We believe this is totally unreasonable and unscientific, because everything is normal in Hong Kong. They are just using this excuse to suppress our rally,"" he said, adding that many other facilities had already reopened. ",0.0

Those sparks have landed in a tinderbox assembled over decades of economic inequality, now made worse by the coronavirus pandemic. Minneapolis police officers initially confronted the man — George Floyd — on suspicion that he'd used a counterfeit $20 bill to buy cigarettes. The viral video of what followed captured an individual tragedy. But it's set against a backdrop of poverty and discrimination that have long colored relations between law enforcement and the African American community. African Americans are worse off than whites by almost every economic measure. And that divide has only deepened during the pandemic that's sent the country into its worst economic downturn in generations. A survey by the Federal Reserve last year found that even in good times, African Americans are less able to pay their monthly bills than whites or Latinos. That's hardly surprising, since median income among African Americans is 41% lower than that of non-Hispanic whites. Blacks are also 40% less likely to own their homes than whites — depriving many African American families of an opportunity to build wealth. The gap in homeownership is particularly stark in Minneapolis. A study by Zillow, the online real estate company, found black homeownership in the city lags more than 50 percentage points below the white rate. ""It tells us that there's racism baked in to the housing market,"" said Andre Perry, a fellow at the Brookings Institution and author of Know Your Price: Valuing Black Lives and Property in America's Black Cities. Income disparity, segregation, and racial redlining have all contributed to low national levels of homeownership among African Americans. Although blacks made housing gains in the 1990s and early 2000s, that was reversed by the subprime mortgage crisis, which led to a wave of foreclosures. Before the pandemic struck, African Americans were enjoying a strong job market. The black unemployment rate in February was 5.8% — near a 50-year low, though still higher than the white rate. Since then, unemployment for all racial groups has soared to double-digits. But the black-white gap has not noticeably worsened. Loading... African Americans who are working, however, are more likely to hold jobs that put them at risk of infection. A survey by the Labor Department found that in 2018, less than 20% of African Americans held jobs they could do from home, compared to about 30% of whites. Higher risk of on-the-job exposure to the coronavirus is compounded by African Americans' higher rates of diabetes, heart disease and other conditions that are thought to contribute to more severe cases of COVID-19. ""There have been epidemics in the black community that have existed for generations before COVID,"" Perry said. ""COVID accentuated and exposed those epidemics."" Just as the pandemic puts unequal health outcomes under a microscope, the video of George Floyd's last moments illuminates the frustration brought about by generations of economic hardship. Four police officers have been fired over the incident. One — Derek Chauvin — has been charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Chauvin is shown pressing his knee against Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes. ""That action really symbolized the knee on the neck of black homeowners and renters,"" Perry said. ""It represents the employers who don't provide the kind of benefits and wages that will lift African American communities."" He suggested the demonstrations taking place across the country, five months before a national election, provide an opportunity for candidates to spell out how they would deal with these challenges. ""If we don't address the structural inequality,"" Perry said, ""we'll be right back in the same place when the next inevitable crisis hits."" : 6/02/20 A previous version of this Web story incorrectly said all four police officers present at the death of George Floyd are white. Copyright 2020 NPR. To see more, visit https://www.npr.org. AILSA CHANG, HOST: The viral video that sparked nationwide protests this weekend captured an individual tragedy - the death of a black man at the hands of police officers in Minneapolis. But George Floyd's death is set against a backdrop of economic inequality that has long shadowed race relations in this country. We're going to talk about that now for a few minutes with NPR's Scott Horsley. Hi, Scott. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Hi, Ailsa. CHANG: So we've been hearing an enormous amount of frustration in the last week about yet another black man dying in police custody. Can you just break down for us how economics plays into that frustration? HORSLEY: There is certainly frustration with the deadly tactics of police. But there's also frustration about the underlying circumstances that in the richest country on Earth, a man could lose his life because he's suspected of passing a counterfeit 20-dollar bill. We know that African Americans are worse off than whites in this country by almost every economic measure. Andre Perry, who studies race and inequality at the Brookings Institution, says that means blacks in general are more vulnerable to any kind of economic downturn. ANDRE PERRY: Black folk live in communities where a single economic shock can really send the entire economic hopes astray. HORSLEY: And, of course, right now, we're all living through a giant economic shock of the coronavirus pandemic. CHANG: Right. HORSLEY: People throughout the country are on edge. And that has just added more dry kindling to the woodpile where this match has landed. CHANG: Well, about the pandemic - I mean, we know that African Americans have suffered disproportionate health problems during this entire outbreak. But economically, how are they faring, relatively speaking, during this time? HORSLEY: Not well. Of course, workers of all races have seen a spike in unemployment during the pandemic. The black unemployment rate has jumped into double digits, as have other rates. But the black-white gap hasn't gotten noticeably worse during the last couple of months. CHANG: Interesting. HORSLEY: We do know, however, African Americans who are working are more likely to be in essential frontline jobs. And that puts them at greater risk of infection. CHANG: So how does Minneapolis, where this all started, stack up when it comes to inequality or when it comes to discrimination? HORSLEY: The racial divide in Minneapolis is pretty stark both in terms of income and homeownership. In fact, the gap between white and black homeownership in Minneapolis is one of the largest in the country. And that matters because for a lot of families, owning a home is the main building block of wealth and stability. If blacks aren't able to buy homes, they're missing out on an important stepping stone. Nationwide, African Americans did make some gains in homeownership in the '90s and early 2000s. But those were really wiped out by the subprime mortgage crisis. And Andre Perry says that kind of structural inequality feeds into the frustration of the people who are protesting George Floyd's death. PERRY: That action really symbolized the knee on the neck of black homeowners and renters. It represents the employers who don't provide the kind of benefits and wages that will lift African American communities. HORSLEY: Now, Perry notes these demonstrations are taking place five months before a national election. And he says this is a good opportunity for policymakers to talk about how they see policing and how they would address these longstanding economic challenges. CHANG: That is NPR's Scott Horsley. Thank you, Scott. HORSLEY: You're welcome. Transcript provided by NPR, Copyright NPR.",0.0

But some health experts, even as they urge caution, said they support the demonstrations — because racism also poses a dire health threat. Tens of thousands of people, masked and unmasked, have thronged the streets of Minneapolis, Atlanta, Louisville, Ky., and other cities in the week since George Floyd died after a white Minneapolis police officer kneeled on his neck. They are the largest public gatherings in the U.S. since the pandemic forced widespread shutdowns, and many local officials warned of a possible spike in new cases in one or two weeks. ""Risk of transmission is lower in open spaces, but wherever there is a gathering there is still the risk of transmitting the virus,"" said Dr. Elaine Nsoesie, an assistant professor of global health at Boston University. Health experts urged protesters not to sing and shout to reduce the threat of person-to-person transmission. And they cautioned that police tactics such as tear gas and pepper spray could exacerbate the situation by prompting people to cough and gasp for air. The New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene issued a list of tips for demonstrators to lower their risk of contracting COVID-19, such as covering their faces and staying in small groups. ""Don't yell; use signs & noise makers instead,"" the department advised. Nsoesie said that while she agrees with the sentiment, ""I can see how some of these tips can be difficult to follow. For example, if you are angry or frustrated about an issue, you want to express that feeling, and speaking is one way of doing that."" She added, ""It's also hard to keep 6 feet of distance at a protest."" Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser said she's worried about how consecutive days of protests could trigger an influx of COVID-19 cases. Huge demonstrations began in the nation's capital on Friday — the same day Bowser lifted stay-at-home orders and eased shutdown rules. The city is still limiting gatherings to no more than 10 people. But in the streets around the White House, that cap is regularly exceeded by orders of magnitude. ""I'm so concerned about it that I'm urging everybody to consider their exposure if they need to isolate from their family members when they go home and if they need to be tested, because we have worked very hard to blunt the curve,"" Bowser said on NBC's Meet the Press. But the risks of congregating during a global pandemic shouldn't keep people from protesting racism, according to dozens of public health and disease experts who signed an open letter in support of the protests.

Later, after they were gone too, 100 or 200 people remained, most not in vehicles, breaking windows and looting. Riot police showed up, and the Albuquerque Police Department says someone fired on them in front of the KiMo Theatre. No injuries have been reported.  At first, it was spiderwebbed windows on storefronts and graffiti, but around 12:30 in the morning at Third Street and Central, people smashed through some of those windows and started pulling things out of the businesses. Motorcycles and cars revved their engines. And businesses’ security alarms sounded. Looters pulled furniture from inside a club, sprayed fire extinguishers at the sky, lobbed glassware high into the air, and started a small fire in the street. Police helicopters circled. Riot police started forming, coming up Central, starting around 5th St. NW, telling everyone to leave. A helicopter above repeated the message through a loudspeaker. People threw things at police, and lit some dumpsters on fire, rolling them toward the line of riot officers, though none reached them. Another line of officers waited on 2nd St. NW. Police fired flash-bangs and rubber bullets, and launched tear gas, announcing they were going to take anyone who didn’t leave into custody. By 5 a.m., helicopters were still circling, and tear gas wafted out of downtown. At 6:45 a.m. Monday, KUNM's Marisa Demarco gave a live update from downtown Albuquerque, speaking with KUNM Morning Edition host, Nash Jones. Listen or read the transcript below. Live from downtown Albuquerque, 6:45 a.m. Monday. NASH JONES: I'm wondering what you're seeing. You're still downtown from last night's Black Lives Matter protest and a riot that occurred late into the night and potentially still happening now. What are you seeing? MARISA DEMARCO: Yeah, so right now, I mean, police have most of downtown completely blocked off. You can't really see most of the main part of the area where a lot of the violence and damage took place, which is on Central, so I'm standing on Copper now. I just kind of walked all the way around and police have blocked it off entirely. I did a little walking up Central until they told me to turn back, and you can still hear some of the alarms from the businesses going off. I'm seeing a lot of garbage trucks too, so I assume that they have the city's solid waste department out here cleaning things up. JONES: And how many people are you seeing besides the officers? DEMARCO: Besides officers? Oh, it's kind of hard to tell. There's some cars, there are some sparse cars. I think most of them are City of Albuquerque vehicles. So seems like maybe a lot of people are here pitching in on the cleanup. JONES: You've been out there most of the evening. Can you tell us a little bit about what you experienced last night? DEMARCO: Yeah, so I joined the Black Lives Matter protest and marched behind the protesters to film and to document and they got downtown and had speeches. And at that point, I would pretty much called that protest over. After that protest was done, people dispersed and went back to their cars. And then there were a lot of cars kind of driving around with signs hanging out their windows, but it still seemed somewhat peaceful, like there was like kids in the cars and stuff. And it wasn't until about one in the morning, maybe 12 or one, when people started breaking into businesses, pulling things out. They lit a small fire. The riot police approached from two sides, fired what I assume were less than lethal rounds and flashbangs I hear that in front of the KiMo [Theatre] someone fired shots on police; I think I was standing right there when it happened, and I don't really know if it if it was live ammo or something else, I have no idea. But things got really rowdy and smoky and aggressive and violent. People were throwing things. People were rolling fiery dumpsters at police like it was, it was rowdy. JONES: And you're saying that this was a separate thing, or it felt like a separate thing, from the protests that had happened earlier on in the evening? DEMARCO: Yeah, so I'm seeing a lot of headlines this morning that say like ‘Black Lives Matter protest erupts into violence.’ And that's really not the way that I was perceiving it last night. It felt like it was a long ways after the Black Lives Matter protest had concluded, and that now we were looking at something different. Which is, you know, maybe some people are holdovers, maybe some new people came downtown, you know, it's hard to say. ****** CORRECTION 6/1: The Q&A transcript as originally posted had an error which has now been corrected to ""police have blocked it off entirely.""

(AP) — The mayor of New Mexico’s largest city is blaming small groups of what he called agitators for violence that broke out hours after hundreds of people gathered for a largely peaceful protest in downtown Albuquerque. Dozens of small fires were set, windows were broken and police officers say they were fired upon early Monday in front of the historic Kimo Theater. Police were responding after the building’s windows were broken and some people got on the roof. Police moved in because they were afraid the building would be set on fire. Another group tried later to force a confrontation with police but ended up leaving. Mayor Tim Keller said there dozens of firearms looted from at least one gun shop and that there was damage to numerous locally-owned coffee shops, breweries and restaurants along the Central Avenue corridor. He said he was grateful no one was seriously injured. While Albuquerque welcomes the right to protest, Keller said gunfire and violence cross the line. “What we saw last night in downtown was not a protest, it was not Albuquerque,” he said. “Protesting is our constitutional right as Americans. We have the strongest voice when we come together and use it as one and express our outrage.” City crews spent the morning boarding up broken windows as other workers picked up debris and cleaned off graffiti. On Sunday evening, several hundred people took part in a march along historic Route 66 in protest of the death of George Floyd, the black man who died after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck even after he stopped moving and pleading for air. The protesters held signs, wore masks and chanted: “Say his name: George Floyd” and “Hands up, don’t shoot.” When the crowd arrived on the western edge of downtown Sunday evening, they stopped, raised their fists into the air and held a moment of silence for Floyd that was followed by cheers. Activist Arthur Bell, 35, later told fellow demonstrators he was “tired of being peaceful.” He said his black skin makes him a target for police and that he is fed up with the situation. Another protest was planned for Monday evening outside police headquarters. Bell said that demonstration would be different. When The Associated Press asked what he meant, Bell said: “A general never gives out his tactics.” While elected leaders in other states have been forced to call out the National Guard, Albuquerque officials said there are no plans to make such a request unless the situation descends into chaos. The mayor said officials will do whatever they can to keep it from getting to that point and he asked for the public’s help. “We can do this without violence on our own city and without more violence on each other,” Keller said. City officials also talked about court-mandated efforts over the past several years to restructure the police department, changes to the way it deals with excessive force and the inclusion of anti-racism and ethics training for police officers and all city employees. Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham in a statement Monday afternoon condemned the violence in Albuquerque, saying she was concerned that a small group of people “took a wrong turn.” “That sort of behavior is an attempt to distort the important work of the peaceful protesters – who have every right to demonstrate in peace – and puts both the protesters and public safety officers at risk,” she said. “Those individuals, I have complete confidence, will be held accountable. There is no place in this moment for hijacking the protesters’ message of justice and non-violence.” Albuquerque police said two people were arrested overnight on misdemeanor charges.",0.0

(KRQE) – The city of Albuquerque is still working to pick up the pieces after rioters went on a rampage downtown. Monday morning, shards of glass and broken windows were visible everywhere along the Central corridor. Many of the business owners in Downtown Albuquerque have boarded up their buildings. Business owners say this is not an effective way to send a message. “The disappointment is I’m afraid this will take away from the narrative and what people are protesting,” says Carrie Phillis, the owner of Effex Nightclub. Sunday night’s Black Lives Matter protest started off peacefully as thousands marched between the University of New Mexico and downtown. Most of those people had gone home when the trouble started before midnight, as rioters set fires in the streets, broke windows, and even fired shots at police. This was all sparked by the killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis Police. The Albuquerque Police Department in riot gear, tried to clear out the crowd of 200-300 people from midnight until after 5:00 a.m. Monday morning, many business owners woke up to find their windows shattered and graffiti covering their business. A group of volunteers made their way downtown to help the businesses clean up as best they could. “The men here are volunteering to clean up. We’re taking out the broken glass from the bank building there,” says Michael Gomez of U-Turn for Christ. Many of the business owners say they are hearing there might be another protest Monday night. With that possibility, many of them are boarding up their businesses to try and prevent any further damage. A lot of businesses in downtown are restaurants and bars that were forced to close two and a half months ago because of the coronavirus. They say all this destruction was just another blow to their business. Related Coverage:",0.0

NEW YORK — It’s not the first time that Spike Lee’s “Do the Right Thing” has been freshly urgent, but Lee’s 1989 film has again found blistering relevance in the wake of George Floyd’s death. On Monday, Lee released a short film titled “3 Brothers” connecting the death of Radio Raheem (played by Bill Nunn) in “Do the Right Thing” to the deaths of Floyd and Eric Garner. Floyd died last week after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee against his neck as he begged for air. Garner’s dying plea of “I can’t breathe” became a rallying cry against police brutality in 2014. Blazed across the screen is the question: “Will history stop repeating itself?” “I’ve seen this before. This is not new,” Lee said in an interview with The Associated Press on Monday. “I was born in ’57 so I was 11 years old when I saw the riots with Dr. King’s assassination, later on with Rodney King and the Simi Valley verdict, Trayvon Martin and Ferguson.” ADVERTISEMENTSkip ................................................................ “People are tired and they take to the streets,” said Lee. “Do the Right Thing,” about rising racial tensions on a hot summer day in Brooklyn’s Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood, took direct inspiration from reality. In the film, Raheem is choked to death by a police officer, sparking a riot. Lee modeled the choke hold that kills Raheem on the murder of Michael Stewart, a graffiti artist who was killed by New York City police officers in 1983. Lee dedicated the film to Stewart’s family, as well as those of several other black people killed by police officers. “His death is not just made up. Many years later, Eric Garner, automatically I thought of Ray Raheem,” said Lee. “Then to see my brother George Floyd. I mean, he was quoting the words of Eric Garner: ‘I can’t breathe.’ He was channeling Eric Garner. I’m sure of it.” As much as Lee sees history repeating itself, there’s one element of the current unrest that strikes the filmmaker as new. “I’ve been very encouraged by the diversity of the protesters. I haven’t seen this diverse protests since when I was a kid,” Lee said, citing the movements of the ’60s. “I’m encouraged that my white sisters and brothers are out there. “That is the hope of this country, this diverse, younger generation of Americans who don’t want to perpetuate the same (expletive) that their parents and grandparents and great-grandparents got caught up in. That’s my hope.” To illustrate the point, Lee cited cities with smaller black populations, like Des Moines, Iowa, where protests and riots have occurred. ADVERTISEMENTSkip ................................................................ “My young white sisters and brothers are out there in the streets. How many black folks are in Salt Lake City, Utah? And let’s take into account that the NBA is not playing,” said Lee, letting out an enormous cackle. “The Utah Jazz are not playing!” “3 Brothers” is the second short Lee has released during the pandemic. While Lee has kept to his Upper East Side apartment with his family, he has also biked around the city to shoot. Lee’s “New York, New York,” set to Frank Sinatra, was released in early May as an ode to his outbreak-stricken city. Next week, he’ll release on Netflix “Da 5 Bloods,” a Vietnam War drama about four black veterans who return to Vietnam to find the remains of their fallen squad leader (Chadwick Boseman). Lee has only modest hopes for justice in the aftermath of Floyd’s death. Attorney General William Barr he calls “not a friend to justice.” “He’s going to do what Agent Orange tell him to do,” said Lee, using his favored nickname for President Donald Trump. But Lee has been buoyed by a photo of New York police officers kneeling with protesters, an image he likened to Colin Kaepernick’s NFL protests. “They need to show the image more,” said Lee. “Colin Kaepernick is a patriot.” ___ Follow AP Film Writer Jake Coyle on Twitter at: http://twitter.com/JakeCoyleAP",0.0

That’s daytime television, however. When darkness falls and prime-time television begins, earnest activism is replaced by tense scenes of conflict unique in their breadth. Scenes of urban unrest have been visible before in the nation’s history — the 1968 riots were more frightening and deadly — but not in so many cities at the same time, with so many cameras to observe. Civil rights activist Al Sharpton said Monday that he’s worried about a backlash caused by the attention paid to violent demonstrations. “If you only display that, in this whole ‘if it bleeds, it leads’ media obsession, than in many ways you are hurting George Floyd all over again,” said Sharpton, an MSNBC host. “Because he becomes a side story to the tragedy of what happened and to the pursuit of justice.” What’s happening in the cities need to be covered, but not at the expense of losing Floyd, he said. What appeared live on CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC the last few nights was gripping and absorbing. In Washington, people stood holding cell phone cameras above their heads Sunday night, capturing flames shooting in the air, the way they would at a concert in more peaceful times. MSNBC’s Garrett Haake walked through the streets reporting live and viewers could see what perhaps he couldn’t: police officers waving at him to get away. Suddenly, bang! And an expletive. Haake had been hit by a rubber bullet. He kept trying to talk but his crew had separated, and anchor Katy Tur told him to find a safe refuge.

Switch to CNN and reporter Shimon Prokupecz is in New York’s Union Square, watching a roiling crowd in a tense standoff with police. He’s almost trampled when people suddenly run in his direction. In Santa Monica, California, MSNBC’s Gadi Schwartz is in an outdoor mall, watching people stream out of a sporting goods store, carrying as much plundered merchandise as they could hold. A police siren wails nearby, and everyone scatters. Networks have done strong work covering demonstrations and speaking to peaceful protesters during the day, but what comes later is hard to compete with, said Robert Thompson, director of the Bleier Center for Television and Popular Culture at Syracuse University. “The dominant pictures in 2020, as it was in 1968, are of fire and looting,” said veteran journalist Dan Rather, who reported for CBS News during the rioting 52 years ago. “That skews the coverage, as it did in 1968. It gives the impression that the whole country is in collapse. But the whole country is not in collapse. The whole country is not in flames.” The challenge for journalists is to continue covering what prompted the demonstrations and the violence, he said. “That gets lost in a newscast that goes from city to city, and scenes of looting or violence,” Rather said. “That’s part of the story. But the core of the story is why is this happening? What’s this all about?” CNN, which celebrates its 40th anniversary this week, wasn’t around in 1968. Neither were Fox or MSNBC. Live coverage of rioting was rare. For one thing, television crews usually had to carry large, clunky cameras and race back to the office to have film processed. Even during the 1994 Rodney King riots in Los Angeles, the dominant image was somewhat removed: a helicopter shot of a driver being pulled from his truck and beaten. Portable, lightweight equipment now permits journalists to get in the middle of the action. Rather was memorably manhandled while reporting at the raucous Democratic convention in Chicago in 1968. That’s mild compared to what happened this weekend. The U.S. Press Freedom Tracker is investigating a stunning 78 reported cases of physical attacks on journalists over the past three days, in at least 25 different cities. In many cases, journalists made it clear to authorities that they were members of the press, and were attacked anyway, said Kirstin McCudden, managing editor of the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker. It’s one reason why Sally Buzbee, executive editor at The Associated Press, stressed safety to the company’s news managers in an internal call on Monday morning.",0.0

(KRQE) – The city of Albuquerque is still working to pick up the pieces after rioters went on a rampage downtown. Monday morning, shards of glass and broken windows were visible everywhere along the Central corridor. Many of the business owners in Downtown Albuquerque have boarded up their buildings. Business owners say this is not an effective way to send a message. “The disappointment is I’m afraid this will take away from the narrative and what people are protesting,” says Carrie Phillis, the owner of Effex Nightclub. Sunday night’s Black Lives Matter protest started off peacefully as thousands marched between the University of New Mexico and downtown. Most of those people had gone home when the trouble started before midnight, as rioters set fires in the streets, broke windows, and even fired shots at police. This was all sparked by the killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis Police. The Albuquerque Police Department in riot gear, tried to clear out the crowd of 200-300 people from midnight until after 5:00 a.m. Monday morning, many business owners woke up to find their windows shattered and graffiti covering their business. A group of volunteers made their way downtown to help the businesses clean up as best they could. “The men here are volunteering to clean up. We’re taking out the broken glass from the bank building there,” says Michael Gomez of U-Turn for Christ. Many of the business owners say they are hearing there might be another protest Monday night. With that possibility, many of them are boarding up their businesses to try and prevent any further damage. A lot of businesses in downtown are restaurants and bars that were forced to close two and a half months ago because of the coronavirus. They say all this destruction was just another blow to their business. Related Coverage:",0.0

He shared his own message to the people causing destruction. Video shows Jones confronting a group of guys wearing hoodies in downtown Albuquerque Sunday night, and demanded they hand over their spray cans. “Give me the spray can,” Jones tells the young men. “I ain’t doing nothing,” the man replied. “Give me the spray can,” Jones repeated.

Video of Jones taking the spray cans away was posted on Jones’ Instagram account and had more than 1.3 million views by noon on Monday. The Albuquerque UFC fighter says he went out to be a part of the peaceful protest, calling for justice after the death of George Floyd. However, what he saw unfold late last Sunday night was not helping the cause, he said. “The George Floyd situation was disgusting. It was terrible,” said Jones. “I felt his pain.

But you don’t meet these feelings with anger,” Jones added. KRQE News 13’s cameras captured vandals smashing windows of businesses, lighting fires, and tagging walls with graffiti.

Reuters reports flared demonstrators vented their anger over the killing of George Floyd by policeman Derek Chauvin. Floyd was an African American man who died in Minneapolis this week after a white police officer knelt on his neck. From Minneapolis to New York City, Atlanta, and Washington, protesters clashed with law enforcement over the treatment of minorities by the police. Prosecutors announced Friday that Chavin had been arrested on third-degree murder and manslaughter charges. Wochit ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. – The mayor of New Mexico’s largest city is blaming small groups of what he called agitators for violence that broke out hours after hundreds of people gathered for a largely peaceful protest in downtown Albuquerque. Dozens of small fires were set, windows were broken and police officers say they were fired upon early Monday in front of the historic Kimo Theater. Police were responding after the building’s windows were broken and some people got on the roof. Police moved in because they were afraid the building would be set on fire. Another group tried later to force a confrontation with police but ended up leaving. The latest: George Floyd vigil planned for Monday by Branigan Library Mayor Tim Keller said there dozens of firearms looted from at least one gun shop and that there was damage to numerous locally-owned coffee shops, breweries and restaurants along the Central Avenue corridor. He said he was grateful no one was seriously injured. While Albuquerque welcomes the right to protest, Keller said gunfire and violence cross the line. “What we saw last night in downtown was not a protest, it was not Albuquerque,” he said. “Protesting is our constitutional right as Americans. We have the strongest voice when we come together and use it as one and express our outrage.” In this May 31, 2020, photo, demonstrators hold a moment of silence at the Civic Plaza in Albuquerque, N.M. after marching along the city's historic Route 66, protesting the death of George Floyd in Minnesota.

(Photo: Russell ContrerasAP) City crews spent the morning boarding up broken windows as other workers picked up debris and cleaned off graffiti. On Sunday evening, several hundred people took part in a march along historic Route 66 in protest of the death of George Floyd, the black man who died after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck even after he stopped moving and pleading for air. The protesters held signs, wore masks and chanted: “Say his name: George Floyd” and “Hands up, don’t shoot.” When the crowd arrived on the western edge of downtown Sunday evening, they stopped, raised their fists into the air and held a moment of silence for Floyd that was followed by cheers. More: George Floyd died from 'asphyxiation from sustained pressure,' family autopsy finds Activist Arthur Bell, 35, later told fellow demonstrators he was “tired of being peaceful.” He said his black skin makes him a target for police and that he is fed up with the situation. Another protest was planned for Monday evening outside police headquarters. Bell said that demonstration would be different. When The Associated Press asked what he meant, Bell said: “A general never gives out his tactics.” While elected leaders in other states have been forced to call out the National Guard, Albuquerque officials said there are no plans to make such a request unless the situation descends into chaos. The mayor said officials will do whatever they can to keep it from getting to that point and he asked for the public’s help. “We can do this without violence on our own city and without more violence on each other,” Keller said. City officials also talked about court-mandated efforts over the past several years to restructure the police department, changes to the way it deals with excessive force and the inclusion of anti-racism and ethics training for police officers and all city employees.

There is no place in this moment for hijacking the protesters’ message of justice and non-violence.” Albuquerque police said two people were arrested overnight on misdemeanor charges.

Las Cruces Sun-News LAS CRUCES - On Sunday a group of about 30 people gathered on the lawn of the Branigan Memorial Library in Las Cruces to mourn the death of Minneapolis man George Floyd and to raise awareness about racism in the United States. The vigil was organized by Kimberly York, second vice president of the Doña Ana County NAACP, who is also on the executive committee of Michelle Lujan Grisham's Office of African American Affairs, and Patrick Turner, a researcher at New Mexico State University. They'll be hosting a second vigil beginning at 7 p.m. Tuesday on the downtown plaza. Stay informed. Sign up for a subscription to the Sun-News. There was also a vigil planned to begin at 5 p.m. Monday in front of the library. During the day Monday, dozens of protesters in front of the library held signs and spoke out to passersby, attempting to raise awareness about police brutality and racism. Floyd, who is black, was killed in Minneapolis on May 25 when white police officer Derek Chauvin knelt on his neck for close to nine minutes, while Floyd repeatedly told him that he couldn't breathe. On Friday, Chauvin was charged with one count of third-degree murder, and one count of manslaughter and is facing up to 35 years in prison if convicted of both crimes, and a $20,000 fine if convicted of the manslaughter charge. Since his homicide, protests and riots have occurred in cities across the nation. Clashes between protesters and police happened in El Paso and Albuquerque on Sunday night. In contrast, Las Cruces protests have been calm and mostly concentrated in front of the library, at the corner of Main Street and Picacho Ave. Getting out to vote Though demonstrating can accomplish much, York said the other part of the NAACP strategy to enact change is to encourage voting. She said there'd be a chance for attendees of Tuesday's vigil to register to vote. It'll be too late to vote in New Mexico primary election, which is Tuesday, but residents can register to vote in the general election on Nov. 3. ""Our lives depend on it,"" she said. ""We have to do our civic duty and we have to make sure that we are not only staying involved at this level but when there are opportunities to speak out that we feel empowered to be able to do so."" A clinical therapist, York said between the COVID-19 emergency and Floyd's death, she has seen a 75 percent increase in her practices in both Las Cruces and Cleveland, Ohio. Attendees at Sunday's vigil and Monday's protest had much to say about the current state of race affairs and police actions in America. Here's some of what they told the Sun-News. For their children On Sunday, Christopher Brooks, president of the New Mexico State University Black Student Association, said he attended in part because of his children. ""Just really step up to show America, to show our neighborhoods, to show our communities what America is all about. This, what we're seeing right now, is not the America I want my sons and daughters to grow up in. This isn't what I want them to see. We're so much better than that,"" he said.

(Photo: Bethany Freudenthal/Sun-News) A mother of two, Jasmine Williams said she's had a difficult time explaining to her children that Floyd's race likely played a part in why he was killed. She has two daughters, who are black, and she wants to teach them that they are beautiful. ""I need them to understand that they need to fight and understand and feel beautiful for who they are and not based off of what somebody tells them to be beautiful, and what somebody tells them they need to look like or how they need to behave,"" she said Sunday during the vigil. Williams said she experiences racism every day of her life. Speak up Ignacio Alvarado, who is dark-skinned, said he was 12 years old and on a road trip with his family when he was called the ""N"" word. He's now 19 and was attending Monday's protest to highlight racial injustices happening in the United States ""Society has basically brainwashed people into thinking that African Americans and people of color are dangerous by nature and they don't take the time to realize we're people ourselves. We're not a threat to anyone. We're trying to go about our lives, our own responsibilities and our own worries,"" he said. When Alvarado saw the video of Floyd's death, he said it was tragic. ""But personally I'm used to seeing African American males pinned down in the street, murdered,"" he said. More: Doña Ana County NAACP president: I can't breathe either Karra Trout, 17, said it enrages her when she sees black men and women victimized by law enforcement. ""Police are killing black people based on the color of their skin. It happens all over the country and nobody is doing anything about it,"" she said. Trout said racism isn't a big issue in Las Cruces. But protests. like the one Monday, are important to inform the community of what's happening nationwide, she said. Arizona State University journalism student Erin Galindo, who grew up in Las Cruces said she felt it was important to attend the protest as a person of color. ""Standing with a community of people who are being murdered because of the color of their skin, that shouldn't be objective. That's just wrong to stay silent at a time like this,"" she said. A cycle that has to end Brother Caleb Oeming, a friar at the Franciscan Community of Mercy at Holy American National Catholic Church, said he felt it was his duty to attend the protest Monday. ""If I'm going to say that I support and that I follow Jesus Christ who fought for justice and stood up for justice, and I turn a blind eye because I'm comfortable and look like the in-group, I'm a hypocrite,"" he said. More: Oeming said police brutality against black people is a cycle that has to end. ""What happened most recently in Minneapolis, this is horrific and this is ongoing, over and over again. I feel like people aren't seeing the disparity that's happening. We teach love and forgiveness and at the same turn around and allow this to happen,"" he said.

We have the strongest voice when we come together and use it as one and express our outrage.” In this May 31, 2020, photo, demonstrators hold a moment of silence at the Civic Plaza in Albuquerque, N.M. after marching along the city's historic Route 66, protesting the death of George Floyd in Minnesota.

On Sunday evening, several hundred people took part in a march along historic Route 66 in protest of the death of George Floyd, the black man who died after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck even after he stopped moving and pleading for air. The protesters held signs, wore masks and chanted: “Say his name: George Floyd” and “Hands up, don’t shoot.” When the crowd arrived on the western edge of downtown Sunday evening, they stopped, raised their fists into the air and held a moment of silence for Floyd that was followed by cheers. More: George Floyd died from 'asphyxiation from sustained pressure,' family autopsy finds Activist Arthur Bell, 35, later told fellow demonstrators he was “tired of being peaceful.” He said his black skin makes him a target for police and that he is fed up with the situation. Another protest was planned for Monday evening outside police headquarters. Bell said that demonstration would be different. When The Associated Press asked what he meant, Bell said: “A general never gives out his tactics.” While elected leaders in other states have been forced to call out the National Guard, Albuquerque officials said there are no plans to make such a request unless the situation descends into chaos. The mayor said officials will do whatever they can to keep it from getting to that point and he asked for the public’s help. “We can do this without violence on our own city and without more violence on each other,” Keller said. City officials also talked about court-mandated efforts over the past several years to restructure the police department, changes to the way it deals with excessive force and the inclusion of anti-racism and ethics training for police officers and all city employees.

Michelle Lujan Grisham in a statement Monday afternoon condemned the violence in Albuquerque, saying she was concerned that a small group of people “took a wrong turn.” “That sort of behavior is an attempt to distort the important work of the peaceful protesters – who have every right to demonstrate in peace – and puts both the protesters and public safety officers at risk,” she said. “Those individuals, I have complete confidence, will be held accountable. There is no place in this moment for hijacking the protesters’ message of justice and non-violence.” Albuquerque police said two people were arrested overnight on misdemeanor charges.

(AP Photo/Patrick Semansky) WASHINGTON (AP) — Amid racial unrest across the nation, President Donald Trump on Monday declared himself “the president of law and order” and threatened to deploy the United States military to American cities to quell a rise of violent protests. As Trump spoke, an incredible TV split screen developed around the White House. While he addressed the nation in the White House’s idyllic Rose Garden, a series of military vehicles rolled out front on Pennsylvania Avenue and military police and law enforcement clashed with protesters at Lafayette Park. Those peaceful demonstrators were cleared so Trump could walk across the park to St. John’s Episcopal Church, known as “The Church of the Presidents,” which suffered fire damage in a protest this week. Holding a Bible, he then stood with several of his Cabinet members as the cameras clicked. “We have the greatest country in the world,” Trump declared. “We’re going to keep it safe.” Trump said he would mobilize “thousands and thousands” of soldiers to keep the peace if governors did not use the National Guard to shut down the protests. Loud tear gas explosions could be heard as authorities moved what appeared to be peaceful protests in the park. The escalation came just after Attorney General William Barr came to the park to to survey the demonstrators. According to senior defense officials, between 600 and 800 National Guard members from five states were being sent to Washington to provide assistance. Those troops were either already on the ground or will arrive by midnight. Under the Civil War-era Posse Comitatus Act, federal troops are prohibited from performing domestic law enforcement actions such as making arrests, seizing property or searching people. In extreme cases, however, the president can invoke the Insurrection Act, also from the Civil War, which allows the use of active-duty or National Guard troops for law enforcement. The officials said that some of the National Guard in D.C. will be armed and others will not. They said that the D.C. guard members do not have non-lethal weapons. The military police that are visible in the city are members of the Guard. ——————- THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP’s original story is below. —————————————— President Donald Trump on Monday derided many governors as “weak” and demanded tougher crackdowns on burning and stealing among some demonstrations in the aftermath of violent protests in dozens of American cities. Trump spoke to governors on a video teleconference that also included law enforcement and national security officials, telling the state leaders they “have to get much tougher.” “Most of you are weak,” Trump said. “You have to arrest people.” The days of protests were triggered by the death of George Floyd, a black man who died when a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck for several minutes even after he stopped moving and pleading for air. The demonstrations turned violent in several cities, with people trashing stores, smashing and burning police cars and igniting fires in historic Lafayette Park across from the White House. Accused by critics of doing too little to defuse the crisis, Trump was to address the nation early Monday evening. The president urged the governors to deploy the National Guard, which he credited for helping calm the situation Sunday night in Minneapolis. He demanded that similarly tough measures be taken in cities that also experienced violence, including New York, Philadelphia and Los Angeles. “You’ve got to arrest people, you have to track people, you have to put them in jail for 10 years and you’ll never see this stuff again,” said Trump. “We’re doing it in Washington, D.C. We’re going to do something that people haven’t seen before.” The president told the governors they were making themselves “look like fools” for not calling up more of the National Guard as a show for force on city streets. Attorney General Bill Barr, who was also on the call, told governors that a joint terrorist task force would be used to track agitators and urged local officials to “dominate” the streets and control, not react to crowds. He urged the governors to “go after troublemakers.” Trump’s angry exhortations at the nation’s governors came after a Sunday night of escalating violence, images of fires and looting and clashes with police filling the nation’s airwaves and overshadowing the largely peaceful protests. The protests had grown so heated Friday night that the Secret Service rushed the president to an underground bunker previously used during terrorist attacks. On Monday, Trump also spoke of trying to criminalize flag-burning. The Supreme Court has conservative new members since it last ruled on that issue, and Trump said that “I think it’s time to review that again.” He continued his effort to project strength, using inflammatory tweets and delivering partisan attacks. As cities have burned night after night and images of violence have dominated television coverage, Trump’s advisers have discussed the prospect of an Oval Office address in an attempt to ease tensions. The notion was quickly scrapped for lack of policy proposals and the president’s own seeming disinterest in delivering a message of unity. Trump did not appear in public on Sunday and was not scheduled to on Monday either. The demonstrations in Washington appeared to catch officers by surprise. They sparked one of the highest alerts at the White House complex since the Sept. 11 attacks in 2001. Trump has told advisers he worries about his safety, while both privately and publicly praising the work of the Secret Service. Demonstrators returned Sunday afternoon, facing off against police at Lafayette Park into the evening. Trump retweeted a message from a conservative commentator encouraging authorities to respond with greater force. “This isn’t going to stop until the good guys are willing to use overwhelming force against the bad guys,” Buck Sexton wrote in a message amplified by the president. In recent days security at the White House has been reinforced by the National Guard and additional personnel from the Secret Service and the U.S. Park Police.

Yet the message Trump appeared to be sending with the brazen pushback of protesters outside the White House was that he sees few limits to what he is willing to do. Some around the president likened the moment to 1968, when Richard Nixon ran as the law-and-order candidate in the aftermath of a summer of riots, capturing the White House. But despite his efforts to portray himself as a political outsider, Trump is an incumbent who risks being held responsible for the violence. Minutes before Trump began speaking, police and National Guard soldiers began aggressively forcing back hundreds of peaceful protesters who had gathered in Lafayette Park, across the street from the White House, where they were chanting against police brutality and Floyd's death in Minneapolis. As Trump spoke, tear gas canisters could be heard exploding. Floyd died last week after he was pinned to the pavement by a police officer who put his knee on the handcuffed black man's neck until he stopped breathing. His death set off protests that spread from Minneapolis across America. His brother Terrence pleaded with protesters on Monday to remain peaceful. Five months before Election Day, the president made clear that he would stake his reelection efforts on convincing voters that his strong-arm approach was warranted to quell the most intense civil unrest since the 1960s. He made little effort to address the grievances of black Americans and others outraged by Floyd's death and the scourge of police brutality, undermining what his campaign had hoped would be increased appeal to African American voters. The scene in and around the White House on Monday night appeared to be carefully orchestrated. As the crowd of protesters grew, Attorney General William Barr arrived in Lafayette Park to look over at the demonstrations and the swarm of law enforcement. The sudden shift in tactics against the protesters was initially a mystery. Then, after finishing his Rose Garden remarks, Trump emerged from the White House gates and walked through the park to St. John's Church, where an office had been set on fire the previous night. Trump, who rarely attends church, held up a Bible and gathered a group of advisers - all white - to pose for photos. The moment was quickly decried by Trump's critics, with New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo saying the president ""used the military to push out a peaceful protest so he could have a photo op at a church."" ""It's all just a reality TV show for this president,"" he said on Twitter. ""Shameful."" Federal law permits presidents to dispatch the military into states to suppress an insurrection or if a state is defying federal law, legal experts said. But Trump's statements also set up an immediate conflict with officials in New York and other states who asserted that the president does not have the unilateral right to send in troops against the will of local governments. The country has been beset by angry demonstrations for the past week in some of the most widespread racial unrest in the U.S. since the 1960s. Spurred largely by Floyd's death, protesters have taken to the streets to decry the killings of black people by police. Minneapolis Officer Derek Chauvin has been charged with murder, but protesters are demanding that three of his colleagues be prosecuted, too. All four were fired. While most of the demonstrations have been peaceful, others have descended into violence, leaving neighborhoods in shambles, stores ransacked, windows broken and cars burned, despite curfews around the country and the deployment of thousands of National Guard members in at least 15 states. On Monday, demonstrations erupted from Philadelphia, where hundreds of protesters spilled onto a highway in the heart of the city, to Atlanta, where police fired tear gas at demonstrators, to Nashville, where more than 60 National Guard soldiers put down their riot shields at the request of peaceful protesters who had gathered in front of Tennessee's state Capitol to honor Floyd. Two people were killed during protests in the Chicago suburb of Cicero, authorities said, but provided no details. In Louisville, Kentucky, riot police firing tear gas scattered several hundred protesters from downtown, violently capping a day of mostly peaceful protests. A vehicle plowed through a group of law enforcement officers at a demonstration in Buffalo, New York, injuring at least two. Video from the scene showed the vehicle accelerating through an intersection shortly after officers apparently tackled a protester and handcuffed him. The officers were hospitalized in stable condition, authorities said. In New York City, where nightfall has brought widespread scenes of destruction, large crowds rallied peacefully in Times Square and Brooklyn during the day. Then, in early evening, looters rushed into a Nike store in Manhattan and protesters smashed storefront windows near Rockefeller Center. Video posted on social media showed some protesters arguing with people breaking windows, urging them to stop. The city has already endured immense commercial damage from the unrest. On Monday, rioters got through the doors of the city's flagship Macy's store, famous for its Thanksgiving Day parade, and police later pulled at least two handcuffed men out of the store and put them into a van. By that time, most of the the street was littered with broken glass. In Washington, protesters continued marching peacefully through Washington hours after being forced from Lafayette park and past the 7 p.m. curfew. Eventually, within sight of the Capitol building, the marchers were turned back by law enforcement officers using tear gas, pellets and low-flying helicopters kicking up debris. As they dispersed, some protesters smashed windows at a nearby office building. Earlier Monday, Trump told the nation's governors in a video conference that they ""look like fools"" for not deploying even more National Guard troops. ""Most of you are weak,"" he said. He added: ""You've got to arrest people, you have to track people, you have to put them in jail for 10 years and you'll never see this stuff again."" Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, a Democrat, dismissed Trump's comments as the ""rantings of an insecure man trying to look strong after building his entire political career on racism."" Former Vice President Joe Biden, the Democratic presidential candidate, vowed to address institutional racism in his first 100 days in office. He met in person with black leaders in Delaware and also held a virtual meeting with big-city mayors. Biden said hate emerges ""when you have somebody in power who breathes oxygen into the hate."" In Minneapolis, meanwhile, Floyd's brother Terrence made an emotional plea for peace at the site where Floyd was arrested. ""Let's switch it up, y'all. Let's switch it up. Do this peacefully, please,"" Terrence Floyd said as he urged people to use their power at the ballot box. Also Monday, an autopsy commissioned for Floyd's family found that he died of asphyxiation from neck and back compression, the family's attorneys said. Authorities in many cities have blamed the violence on outside agitators, though have provided little evidence to back that up. But on Monday, federal authorities arrested a 28-year-old Illinois man saying he had posted self-recorded video on his Facebook page last week that showed him in Minneapolis handing out explosive devices and encouraging people to throw them at law enforcement officers. More than 5,600 people nationwide have been arrested over the past week for such offenses as stealing, blocking highways and breaking curfew, according to a count by The Associated Press. ___ Sullivan and Morrison reported from Minneapolis.

During the march, a few acts of vandalism were witnessed, but the majority of protestors were not destroying or defacing property. Later, after most of the protestors had dispersed, a small group returned downtown to cause damage. ""That is not a part, necessarily part our movement that we did earlier. But stay vigilant, stay safe, thank you for supporting, but if anything goes on after that—that's not what we're all about,” Scott said. ""We love our community.

""The overall problem we want to address is the change that needs to be effected in our system of policing black communities specifically,” Freeman said. The organizers said they were thankful to APD for allowing them to march peacefully. KOB 4 asked the organizers if they had considered holding their demonstrations earlier in the day to dissuade violence at night, but they said it’s too hot outside, which is why they’ll continue to try to wrap things up before it gets too late.",0.0

Yet the message Trump appeared to be sending with the brazen pushback of protesters outside the White House was that he sees few limits to what he is willing to do. Some around the president likened the moment to 1968, when Richard Nixon ran as the law-and-order candidate in the aftermath of a summer of riots, capturing the White House. But despite his efforts to portray himself as a political outsider, Trump is an incumbent who risks being held responsible for the violence. Minutes before Trump began speaking, police and National Guard soldiers began aggressively forcing back hundreds of peaceful protesters who had gathered in Lafayette Park, across the street from the White House, where they were chanting against police brutality and Floyd's death in Minneapolis. As Trump spoke, tear gas canisters could be heard exploding. Floyd died last week after he was pinned to the pavement by a police officer who put his knee on the handcuffed black man's neck until he stopped breathing. His death set off protests that spread from Minneapolis across America. His brother Terrence pleaded with protesters on Monday to remain peaceful. Five months before Election Day, the president made clear that he would stake his reelection efforts on convincing voters that his strong-arm approach was warranted to quell the most intense civil unrest since the 1960s. He made little effort to address the grievances of black Americans and others outraged by Floyd's death and the scourge of police brutality, undermining what his campaign had hoped would be increased appeal to African American voters. The scene in and around the White House on Monday night appeared to be carefully orchestrated. As the crowd of protesters grew, Attorney General William Barr arrived in Lafayette Park to look over at the demonstrations and the swarm of law enforcement. The sudden shift in tactics against the protesters was initially a mystery. Then, after finishing his Rose Garden remarks, Trump emerged from the White House gates and walked through the park to St. John's Church, where an office had been set on fire the previous night. Trump, who rarely attends church, held up a Bible and gathered a group of advisers - all white - to pose for photos. The moment was quickly decried by Trump's critics, with New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo saying the president ""used the military to push out a peaceful protest so he could have a photo op at a church."" ""It's all just a reality TV show for this president,"" he said on Twitter. ""Shameful."" Federal law permits presidents to dispatch the military into states to suppress an insurrection or if a state is defying federal law, legal experts said. But Trump's statements also set up an immediate conflict with officials in New York and other states who asserted that the president does not have the unilateral right to send in troops against the will of local governments. The country has been beset by angry demonstrations for the past week in some of the most widespread racial unrest in the U.S. since the 1960s. Spurred largely by Floyd's death, protesters have taken to the streets to decry the killings of black people by police. Minneapolis Officer Derek Chauvin has been charged with murder, but protesters are demanding that three of his colleagues be prosecuted, too. All four were fired. While most of the demonstrations have been peaceful, others have descended into violence, leaving neighborhoods in shambles, stores ransacked, windows broken and cars burned, despite curfews around the country and the deployment of thousands of National Guard members in at least 15 states. On Monday, demonstrations erupted from Philadelphia, where hundreds of protesters spilled onto a highway in the heart of the city, to Atlanta, where police fired tear gas at demonstrators, to Nashville, where more than 60 National Guard soldiers put down their riot shields at the request of peaceful protesters who had gathered in front of Tennessee's state Capitol to honor Floyd. Two people were killed during protests in the Chicago suburb of Cicero, authorities said, but provided no details. In Louisville, Kentucky, riot police firing tear gas scattered several hundred protesters from downtown, violently capping a day of mostly peaceful protests. A vehicle plowed through a group of law enforcement officers at a demonstration in Buffalo, New York, injuring at least two. Video from the scene showed the vehicle accelerating through an intersection shortly after officers apparently tackled a protester and handcuffed him. The officers were hospitalized in stable condition, authorities said. In New York City, where nightfall has brought widespread scenes of destruction, large crowds rallied peacefully in Times Square and Brooklyn during the day. Then, in early evening, looters rushed into a Nike store in Manhattan and protesters smashed storefront windows near Rockefeller Center. Video posted on social media showed some protesters arguing with people breaking windows, urging them to stop. The city has already endured immense commercial damage from the unrest. On Monday, rioters got through the doors of the city's flagship Macy's store, famous for its Thanksgiving Day parade, and police later pulled at least two handcuffed men out of the store and put them into a van. By that time, most of the the street was littered with broken glass. In Washington, protesters continued marching peacefully through Washington hours after being forced from Lafayette park and past the 7 p.m. curfew. Eventually, within sight of the Capitol building, the marchers were turned back by law enforcement officers using tear gas, pellets and low-flying helicopters kicking up debris. As they dispersed, some protesters smashed windows at a nearby office building. Earlier Monday, Trump told the nation's governors in a video conference that they ""look like fools"" for not deploying even more National Guard troops. ""Most of you are weak,"" he said. He added: ""You've got to arrest people, you have to track people, you have to put them in jail for 10 years and you'll never see this stuff again."" Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, a Democrat, dismissed Trump's comments as the ""rantings of an insecure man trying to look strong after building his entire political career on racism."" Former Vice President Joe Biden, the Democratic presidential candidate, vowed to address institutional racism in his first 100 days in office. He met in person with black leaders in Delaware and also held a virtual meeting with big-city mayors. Biden said hate emerges ""when you have somebody in power who breathes oxygen into the hate."" In Minneapolis, meanwhile, Floyd's brother Terrence made an emotional plea for peace at the site where Floyd was arrested. ""Let's switch it up, y'all. Let's switch it up. Do this peacefully, please,"" Terrence Floyd said as he urged people to use their power at the ballot box. Also Monday, an autopsy commissioned for Floyd's family found that he died of asphyxiation from neck and back compression, the family's attorneys said. Authorities in many cities have blamed the violence on outside agitators, though have provided little evidence to back that up. But on Monday, federal authorities arrested a 28-year-old Illinois man saying he had posted self-recorded video on his Facebook page last week that showed him in Minneapolis handing out explosive devices and encouraging people to throw them at law enforcement officers. More than 5,600 people nationwide have been arrested over the past week for such offenses as stealing, blocking highways and breaking curfew, according to a count by The Associated Press. ___ Sullivan and Morrison reported from Minneapolis.

In New Jersey, Chris DeLeon, broom in hand, arrived at 8 a.m. with dozens of other people to sweep up broken glass in the capital of Trenton. The 34-year-old had protested Sunday, then decided to help clean up after seeing videos of people smashing windows. “It just goes to show there’s at least as many good people as there are other folks out there,” DeLeon said. In Wisconsin, volunteers in Milwaukee and Madison turned up for a second day to clean up damage from the night before. Countless businesses already had taken a hit from restrictions designed to curb the spread of the coronavirus and were starting to reopen just as the protests led to more expensive setbacks: vandalism and stolen merchandise. The owner of the Laugh Factory’s club in Long Beach discovered broken windows and doors, computers smashed and memorabilia stolen, including Three Stooges posters and autographed photos of Redd Foxx and other late comedians. Workers boarded up windows and swept up broken glass Monday. Owner Jamie Masada was offering an unspecified reward to anyone who returns the memorabilia. ADVERTISEMENTSkip ................................................................ “It is not worth anything to them but it means a lot to me,” Masada said, because it’s tied to those who represent “the height of comedy.'” In Sacramento, two-thirds of the capital city’s 600 downtown properties took a hit, with more than 200 broken windows, 330 pieces of graffiti, and more than 50 cases of “significant property damage,” said Michael Ault, executive director of the Downtown Sacramento Partnership. Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan said she didn’t recognize downtown when she walked through it Sunday, “but what I did recognize were the hundreds of volunteers and residents who came because they love Seattle.” Stuehler found the same community spirit in Long Beach. A nurse who had been treating COVID-19 patients, Stuehler took the month off when he joined the protest. He said a small percentage of people vandalized businesses but “the horror of the opportunism, the rage, the disregard for logic and reason — it was shocking.” They had an outsize impact that detracts from the message of overhauling police agencies, Stuehler said. But he said he’s feeling revived after seeing so many people work together. Alycia Barber also was moved to help after watching from her Long Beach apartment as people smashed windows and police doused the crowds with pepper spray Sunday. The 22-year-old got up early and joined others organizing clothing and jewelry strewn inside a Forever 21 store, hours after thieves made off with armloads of merchandise. Few of the volunteers knew each other; they just showed up, she said. There were parents with children, senior citizens, college students. One woman brought paint and brooms so people could paint over graffiti on the outside wall of a parking garage. “I just feel so helpful today,” Barber said, adding that she supports the fight against racial injustice. “But now we also want to get up and make the world a beautiful place for people.” ___ Watson reported from San Diego.

Both times the protests began in anger over police violence against black men — in 1992, when four police officers were acquitted of the brutal beating of Rodney King; now, when George Floyd died in Minnesota after a policeman knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes. ""We keep telling ourselves that somehow technology or training will end police misconduct,"" says Jody David Armour, a law professor who studies the intersection of race and the criminal justice system. ""But in this case, we saw that in Minnesota, the police department did a lot of that stuff. And still here we are."" Armour, who has taught at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles since 1995, talked with All Things Considered about how protests have changed in the 28 years since the Rodney King riots. Interview Highlights On the people who are protesting now vs. in 1992 The protests and marches today you see are multiethnic, multicultural, even multigenerational. And the allyship is something that is more pronounced now than it perhaps once was. I think a lot of people, when they saw that video of George Floyd, who weren't in the black community, felt agony. And I think this time around, more people feel that sympathy and empathy for members of the black community and are standing in solidarity with them. On empathy for Rodney King vs. George Floyd I think at the time of the Rodney King beating it was easier to view it as an isolated incident or as a few bad apples. But now, over time, we see a persistent and pervasive pattern. Over years and years. We see Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia, 25-year-old black man jogging and is shot dead. Two prosecutors look at the facts and don't bring any action. Breonna Taylor in Louisville. No-knock raid, wrong house; she's killed. The procession of hashtags that made up the Black Lives Matter movement in the 2014, 2015, 2016 years. I think more and more people are seeing that it isn't just isolated incidents, that there's something more pervasive and more ingrained in America that we have to address. The police officer's knee on the neck of George Floyd for many was a grim symbol of, kind of, America's knee on the neck of black America. On where broader protests go from here My sense of where the protests can go from here, hopefully will go from here, is we'll have a serious reckoning with the racial injustice that has really provoked and continues to provoke these kinds of eruptions. This is this really kind of a generational upheaval. We can either make some serious structural changes, redistribute power and wealth in a way that we haven't been willing to consider in the past. I think more people are willing to consider things like, even just as a result of the coronavirus crisis, things like universal basic income and ""Medicare for All."" I think that as a result of this other kind of crisis — I think that racism is a kind of virus, too, that mutates and changes from time to time, but continues to persist — that we will take on the necessary work of redistributing wealth and power in such a way that we don't have Skid Rows, 75% of which have black faces in them. That we don't make the faces at the bottom of the well always black faces. And we do start to act as a society like black lives matter.

AS WE ENTERED JUNE WE ARE SEEING HOW CERTAIN SECTORS WERE HIT BY THE VIRUS IN MAY. WE BREAK DOWN HOW CONSTRUCTION SPENDING AND MANUFACTURING ARE FARING WHEN WE COME BACK. >> WE GO LIVE TO WASHINGTON NOW WHERE PRESIDENT TRUMP IS SPEAKING. >> PRESIDENT TRUMP: A NUMBER OF STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE FAILED TO TAKE NECESSARY ACTION TO SAFEGUARD THEIR RESIDENTS. INNOCENT PEOPLE HAVE BEEN BEING LIKE THE YOUNG MEN IN DALLAS, TEXAS, LEFT DYING ON THE STREET. OR THE WOMAN IN UPSTATE NEW YORK VICIOUSLY ATTACKED BY DANGEROUS DOGS. SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS HAVE SEEN THEIR DREAMS DESTROYED. NEW YORK’S FINEST HAVE BEEN HIT IN THE FACE WITH BRICKS. BRAVE NURSES WHO HAVE BATTLED THE VIRUS ARE AFRAID TO LEAVE THEIR HOMES. A POLICE PRECINCT HAS BEEN OVERRUN HERE IN THE NATION’S CAPITAL. THE LINCOLN MEMORIAL AND THE WORLD WAR II MEMORIAL HAVE BEEN VANDALIZED. ONE OF OUR MOST HISTORIC CHURCHES WAS SET ABLAZE. A FEDERAL OFFICER IN CALIFORNIA, AN AFRICAN-AMERICAN ENFORCEMENT HERO, WAS SHOT AND KILLED. THESE ARE NOT ACTS OF PEACEFUL PROTEST. THESE ARE ACTS OF DOMESTIC TERROR. THE DESTRUCTION OF INNOCENT LIFE AND THE SPELLING OF INNOCENT BLOOD IS AN OFFENSE TO HUMANITY AND A CRIME AGAINST GOD. AMERICA NEEDS CREATION NOT DESTRUCTION. COOPERATION NOT CONTEMPT. SECURITY AND NOT ANARCHY. HEALING NOT HATRED. JUSTICE NOT CHAOS. THIS IS OUR MISSION. AND WE WILL SUCCEED, 100%, WE WILL SUCCEED. OUR COUNTRY ALWAYS WINS. THAT IS WHY AM TAKING IMMEDIATE PRESIDENTIAL ACTION TO STOP THE VIOLENCE AND RESTORE SECURITY AND SAFETY IN AMERICA. I AM MOBILIZING ALL AVAILABLE FEDERAL RESOURCES CIVILIAN AND MILITARY TO STOP THE RIOTING AND LOOTING, TWO END THE DESTRUCTION AND ARSON, AND PROTECT THE RIGHTS OF LAW-ABIDING AMERICANS INCLUDING YOUR SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHTS. THEREFORE, THE FOLLOWING MEASURES ARE GOING INTO EFFECT IMMEDIATELY. FIRST, WE’RE ENDING THE RIOTS AND LAWLESSNESS THAT HAS SPREAD THROUGHOUT OUR COUNTRY. WE WILL END IT NOW. TODAY, I HAVE STRONGLY RECOMMENDED TO EVERY GOVERNOR TO DEPLOY THE NATIONAL GUARD IN SUFFICIENT NUMBERS THAT WE DOMINATE THE STREETS. MAYORS AND GOVERNORS MUST ESTABLISH AN OVERWHELMING LAW ENFORCEMENT PRESENCE UNTIL THE VIOLENCE HAS BEEN QUELLED. IF A CITY OR STATE REFUSES TO TAKE THE ACTIONS NECESSARY TO DEFEND THE LIFE AND PROPERTY OF THEIR RESIDENCE, THEN I WILL DEPLOY THE UNITED STATES MILITARY AND QUICKLY SOLVE THE PROBLEM FOR THEM. I AM ALSO TAKING SWIFT AND DECISIVE ACTION TO PROTECT OUR GREAT CAPITAL, WASHINGTON, DC WHAT HAPPENED IN THIS CITY LAST NIGHT WAS OUR TOTAL DISGRACE. AS WE SPEAK, I AM DISPATCHING THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS HAVING -- HEAVILY ARMS SHOULDERS, MILITARY PERSONNEL AND LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS TO STOP THE RIOTING, LOOTING, VANDALISM, ASSAULT, AND THE WANT AND DESTRUCTION OF PROPERTY. WE ARE PUTTING EVERYBODY ON WARNING. OUR 7:00 CURFEW WILL BE STRICTLY ENFORCED. THOSE WHO THREATEN INNOCENT LIFE AND PROPERTY WILL BE ARRESTED, DETAINED AND PROSECUTED TO THE FULLEST EXTENT OF THE LAW. I WANT THE ORGANIZERS OF THIS TERROR TO BE ON NOTICE THAT YOU WILL FACE SEVERE CRIMINAL PENALTIES AND LENGTHY SENTENCES IN JAIL. THIS INCLUDES ANTIFA AND OTHERS WHO ARE INSTIGATORS OF THIS VIOLENCE. ONE LAW IN ORDER, AND THAT IS WHAT IT IS. ONE LAW. WE HAVE ONE BEAUTIFUL LAW. AND ONCE THAT IS RESTORED AND FULLY RESTORED, WE WILL HELP YOU , WE WILL HELP YOUR BUSINESS, AND WE WILL HELP YOUR FAMILY FEARED AMERICA IS FOUNDED UPON THE RULE OF LAW. IT IS THE FOUNDATION OF OUR PROSPERITY, OUR FREEDOM, AND OUR VERY WAY OF LIFE. BUT WHERE THERE IS NO LAW, THERE IS NO OPPORTUNITY. WHERE THERE IS NO JUSTICE, THERE IS NO LIBERTY. WHERE THERE IS NO SAFETY, THERE IS NO FUTURE. WE MUST NEVER GAVE IN TO ANGER OR HATRED. IF MALICE OR VIOLENCE RAINS, THEN NONE OF US IS FREE. I TAKE THESE ACTIONS TODAY WITH FIRM RESOLVE AND WITH A TRUE AND PASSIONATE LOVE FOR OUR COUNTRY. BY FAR OUR GREATEST DAYS LIE AHEAD. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. NOW I WILL PAY RESPECTS TO A VERY SPECIAL PLACE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. [REPORTER SHOUTING QUESTIONS, INDISCERNIBLE] >> THAT WAS PRESIDENT TRUMP SPEAKING IN WASHINGTON.

DOUG: HE ALSO SAYS TO CALL 311 IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO PURCHASE TIME TICKETS OR GET INFO ON HOW TO REPAIR STOREFRONTS DAMAGED FROM PROTESTS. SHELLY: SMALL GROUPS OF AGITATORS, TO USE THE MAYOR’S WORDS, BEGAN TO DAMAGE DOWNTOWN BUILDINGS. MAYOR TIM KELLER SAYING THE SMALL GROUPS ARE DIFFERENT FROM PEACEFUL PROTESTERS MARCHING FOR JUSTICE FOR GEORGE FLOYD, A BLACK MAN KILLED AT THE HANDS OF MINNEAPOLIS POLICE. BUSINESS OWNERS IN THE AREA SAY THEY UNDERSTAND THE NEED TO PROTEST, BUT THEY DON’T WANT TO SEE THIS KIND OF DESTRUCTION. NEW TODAY, PARENTS EVERYWHERE ARE SEARCHING FOR THE RIGHT WORDS TO EXPLAIN THESE PROTESTS TO THEIR CHILDREN. AN AUTHOR AND PSYCHOLOGIST WHO WRITES ABOUT RACE SAYS ""UNNECESSARY. AS FOR WHITE PARENTS, SOCIOLOGISTS SAY IT IS AS IMPORTANT TO ADDRESS THE PAST AS PRESENT. >> TO UNDERSTAND THE PRESENT, YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THE PAST. IT MIGHT MEAN YOU DO NOT KNOW THE ANSWERS AND YOU DON’T FEEL COMFORTABLE TALKING ABOUT THIS WITH YOUR CHILDREN, BUT THAT MEANS YOU CAN DO SOME WORK TO LEARN THE ANSWERS TO THESE QUESTIONS AND TAKE THE TIME TO READ UP ON THIS, AND THIS COULD BE SOMETHING YOU DO WITH THEIR CHILDREN. SHELBY: EXPERTS SAY A BABY’S BRAIN CAN DETERMINE RACIAL BIAS AS EARLY AS TWO YEARS OLD. A NEW MONTH, BUT THE WEATHER LOOKS SIMILAR WITH A FEW STORMS. HERE IS KELLY FRANSON. KELLY: NORTHWEST CORNER OF THE METRO, YOU CAN SEE THOSETHIN, GREEN BANDS COMING OUT, THE OUTFLOW WINDS, GUSTY WINDS MOVING THROUGH THAT CAN HELP TO SPARK NEW STORMS. WE HAVE A STRONGER STORM BETWEEN RIO PUERCO, LIKELY HAIL WITH THAT, AND ALL CAN PRODUCE GUSTY WINDS. AS WE TAKE YOU SOUTH OF SANTA FE, AROUND FOUR CORNERS, WHAT HAS BEEN AROUND HAS DROPPED SOUTH. THESE CAN FLARE RIGHT BACK UP, SO I WILL CONTINUE TO TRACK STORMS. DOUG: NEW MEXICO SURPASSED 7800 CASES, AND ALMOST 2900 -- UP 113 FROM YESTERDAY. 362 PEOPLE HAVE DIED FROM THE VIRUS, AND ALMOST 2900 PEOPLE HAVE RECOVERED. AND HERE YOU CAN SEE HOW THE VIRUS HAS SPREAD ACROSS THE NAVAJO NATION. THEY ARE NOW REPORTING 5,348 CASES, WITH ALMOST 2,000 OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS HAVING RECOVERED. 246 PEOPLE HAVE DIED. THERE IS CONCERN WITH THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN IN NEW MEXICO WITH THE CORONAVIRUS, 4-TIMES HIGHER THAN THE NATIONAL RATE. HERE IS TODD KURTZ. TODD: THERE GETS TO BE SO MANY NUMBERS TOSSED AROUND WHILE TALKING ABOUT CORONAVIRUS. I JUST WANT TO GIVE YOU A VISUAL BREAKDOWN OF CASES BY AGE HERE IN NEW MEXICO. SO TAKE A LOOK AT THIS CHART. THIS IS THE TOTAL CASES OF THE VIRUS SINCE IT IRST STARTED HERE. THE GROUP WITH THE MOST CASES CONTINUES TO BE THOSE FR 30 TO 39 YEARS OLD AT 1317 CASES. RIGHT BELOW THAT WOULD BE PEOPLE IN THEIR 20’S, JUST 71 CASES SEPARATING THE TWO GROUPS. ONE POSITIVE SIGN WOULD BE THE NUMBER OF CASES IN THOSE PEOPLE 70 AND OLDER. OF COURSE, THOSE ARE AGE GROUPS MOST AT RISK OF SEVERE EFFECTS FROM THE CORONAVIRUS. A LOCAL DOCTOR I SPOKE WITH SAID THE LOWER NUMBERS DEFINITELY INDICATE THAT OLDER NEW MEXICANS ARE ADHERING TO THEIR ADVICE AND BEING EXTRA CAUTIOUS DURING THE PANDEMIC. THE WORRY WITH SO MANY YOUNGER PEOPLE TESTING POSITIVE WITH THIS DISEASE, THEY ARE THE ONES WHO TEND TO BE ASYMPTOMATIC, SO THEY ARE MORE LIKELY THE ONES TO SPREAD THE DISEASE AND THEY OFTEN DO NOT KNOW THEY HAVE IT WHEN IN THEIR 20’S AND 30’S. TODD KURTZ, KOAT ACTION 7 NEWS. DOUG: FEWER THAN 900 PEOPLE OVER THE AGE OF 70 IN NEW MEXICO HAVE TESTED POSITIVE FOR CORONAVIRUS. SHELBY: THE CURFEW ON THE NAVAJO NATION HAS BEEN LIFTED. WE HAVE NEW CORONAVIRUS NUMBERS FROM THE AREA. RIGHT NOW, THERE ARE MORE THAN 3500 ACTIVE CASES ON THE NATION. YESTERDAY, 98 NEW CASES WERE REPORTED. 26 MORE PEOPLE HAVE RECOVERED. AND SADLY, ANOTHER FIVE PEOPLE DIED, WHICH BRINGS THAT NUMBER TO 246. NEW NUMBERS ARE GIVING US A DEEPER LOOK AT THE CORONAVIRUS AND RACE AND ETHNICITY. TAKE A LOOK, ACCORDING TO THE STATE HEALTH DEPARTMENT, MORE THAN HALF OF ALL CASES IN NEW MEXICO IDENTIFY AS AMERICAN INDIAN OR ALASKA NATIVE. THE GROUP WITH THE SECOND MOST CASES IS HISPANIC AND LATINO. WHITE IS THIRD WITH NEARLY 12%, FOLLOWED BY AFRICAN AMERICAN. NAVAJO GAMING IS PREPARING TO REOPEN ALL OF ITS PROPERTIES BY FOUR MID- THERE WILL BE MAJOR JUNE. DEEP CLEANING AND SANITIZING AT EACH SITE. ALL TEAM MEMBERS WILL BE REQUIRED TO WEAR FACE MASKS, AND RECEIVE TRAINING. THEY WILL OPERATE AT 50% CAPACITY. THERE WILL BE ONE ENTRANCE. TEMPERATURES WILL BE CHECKED. AND THERE WILL BE NO BUFFETS, UNTIL IT IS SAFE TO REOPEN. DOUG: PNM IS ASKING STATE REGULATORS TO CONSIDER A PROPOSAL THAT WOULD ALLOW IT TO RECOVER FIXED SERVICE COSTS FROM YOU, RATEPAYER. NO MATTER HOW MUCH ELECTRICITY IS ACTUALLY USED BY CUSTOMERS. IF APPROVED, THE UTILITY WILL ADD UP HOW MUCH CUSTOMERS PAID FOR ELECTRICITY THROUGH AND THEN 2021 COMPARE THAT WITH THE ANNUAL REVENUE IT IS ALLOWED TO COLLECT TO COVER THEIR COSTS. THERE ARE NOW MORE THAN 6 MILLION REPORTED CASES OF COVID-19 ACROSS THE GLOBE. IN THE LAST HERE IN THE U.S., 24 HOURS 19,000 NEW CASES WERE REPORTED AND 600 NEW DEATHS. OFFICIALS WORRY IT WILL ONLY GET WORSE BECAUSE OF VIOLENT PROTESTS. ABC’S REENA ROY HAS THIS STORY. REENA: WITH PROTESTS OVER THE DEATH OF GEORGE FLOYD BY INDIANAPOLIS POLICE OFFICER DEREK CHAPMAN -- CHAUVIN, SPREADING ALL OVER THE COUNTRY, THERE IS CAUSE FOR SPREAD OF COVID-19. PEOPLE MARCHING SIDE-BY-SIDE OVER THE LAST SEVERAL DAYS. IN LOS ANGELES, D.C., SAN FRANCISCO AND OTHER CITIES, MANY WITHOUT MASKS. AFTER MONTHS ON LOCKDOWN, NEW YORK CITY, THE LOCATION IN THE U.S. WITH THE MOST CASES AND DEATHS FROM THE PANDEMIC, IS PREPARING FOR PHASE ONE OF REOPENING, SET TO BEGIN EXACTLY ONE WEEK FROM TODAY. >> WE SPENT ALL THIS TIME, CLOSED DOWN, LOCKED DOWN, MASKS, SOCIALLY DISTANCE, AND THEN YOU TURN ON THE TV AND YOU SEE THESE MASS GATHERINGS THAT COULD POTENTIALLY BE INFECTING HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE. AFTER EVERYTHING THAT WE HAVE DONE. REENA: 15 STATES IN TOTAL HAVE REPORTED AN INCREASE IN CASES. THE CDC WARNING THE U.S. COULD PASS 115,000 DEATHS IN LESS THAN THREE WEEKS. IN MINNESOTA TODAY, RESTAURANTS AND BARS ARE BACK IN SOME CAPACITY. BUT THE GOVERNOR WORRIES ABOUT THE VIRUS SPREADING. >> I WOULD TELL THOSE OF YOU WHO WERE OUT THERE PEACEFULLY PROTESTING, IF YOU’RE STARTING TO GET SYMPTOMS OF COVID-19, PLEASE ISOLATE. WE WILL HAVE TO DO SOME CONTACT TRACING, WHICH I HAVE NOT WRAPPED MY MIND AROUND WHAT THAT WOULD LOOK LIKE IN THIS SIZE. REENA: IN FLORIDA MIAMI BEACHES WERE SCHEDULED TO RE-OPEN TODAY , BUT THAT’S NOW BEEN PUSHED BACK BECAUSE OF THE STRAIN ON POLICE. AND IN LOS ANGELES, SOME VIRUS TESTING SITES ARE CLOSED TODAY, WITH DODGER STADIUM BECOMING AN LAPD COMMAND CENTER, LONG LINES HAVE FORMED AS PEOPLE WAIT TO GET TESTED FOR THE VIRUS AT THIS SITE. DOUG: AS YOU HEARD, EXPERTS ARE ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT THE SPREAD OF CORONAVIRUS DURING THE PROTESTS BECAUSE SHOUTING SPREADS MORE DROPLETS THAN OTHER ACTIVITIES. ACCORDING TO THE CDC, 1/3 OF PATIENTS ARE ASYMPTOMATIC. TAKE A LOOK AT THIS FOOTAGE FROM THE FLORIDA KEYS, WHERE SECURITY CREWS ARE IN THE PROCESS OF TAKING DOWN BARRICADES, PREPARING TO RE-OPEN BEACHES IN FLORIDA. THEY CLOSED IN MARCH, LIKE MOST OF THEM DUE TO THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC. SHELBY: NEXT ON 7, FOR THE FIRST TIME, GEORGE FLOYD’S FAMILY VISITING THE SITE WHERE HE DIED.

THEY WANT PEOPLE TO GO OUT AND PEACEFULLY PROTEST, AND ALSO MAKE THEIR VOICES HEARD BY VOTI Advertisement Mayor Keller: Peaceful protestors did not cause havoc in downtown Albuquerque Share Shares Copy Link Copy After hours of peaceful protests on Sunday, small groups of people began destroying businesses and buildings in downtown Albuquerque, according to city officials.""Unfortunately small groups of agitators are distracting and convoluting from the message the protestors are trying to convey and in our city we're seeing the same dynamic,"" said Albuquerque Mayor Tim Keller.Monday Keller said these small groups are different from the peaceful protestors who are marching for justice for George Floyd, a black man killed at the hands of Minneapolis police.""These were people who don't care about the city and want to destroy it,"" said Carri Phillis, the owner of Effex. ""That's where I'm most disappointed. They possibly took the narrative away from the true issue."" This all comes after the coronavirus heavily impacted the already struggling downtown area.""Downtown's been working so hard over these past years to bring out the culture and make it something great for the Albuquerque community, to see this happen down here, it doesn't make any sense to me,"" said Dustin Rael, the manager of Red Door. Many business owners also saying they don't supporting the rioting or looting, but understand the need for protests during this time in our country. ""Violence from those types of police officers or random people that shoot someone jogging, it's not ok, and it's a sickness that this country has unfortunately,"" Phillis said.The death of Floyd reflects decades of pain and anguish that many black Americans feel.""Police brutality is a problem here in America,"" said Nakia R., a Black Lives Matter activist. ""We matter, black lives matter. We don't deserve to be hunted and shot down like animals.""Black organizers told KOAT they don't support the violence and destruction that's happening in Albuquerque and across the country.""All that you see in terms of the rioting and looting and the burning, it's not black people mourning the death of George Floyd,"" said Pamelya Herndon, the first vice chair of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) Albuquerque chapter. ""It's other individuals and other entities that are coming into place.""Keller said that some of the people causing problems on Sunday were arrested. ""Granted these riots are happening, but we need to look at who's starting them,"" Nakia R. said. It's unclear whether the people rioting in Albuquerque are from out of state. ""There certainly is noise on social media of regional out of town groups organizing in Albuquerque and even being paid to do so, but again as we know with social media that may or may not be true,"" said Keller. Herndon said the problem that began the protests needs to be more than just an ""I'm sorry,"" but actionable concepts and strategies need to be put in place. She also said people need to make their voices heard not through violence, but through voting. ""We need police officers to step up when they see that something is going wrong,"" Herndon said. ""We also need to have a situation occurring where we are having conversations with federal legislators in Congress.""Many are hoping for some resolution for this nationwide unrest. ""I really hope it stays peaceful, cause if we can keep that, I think it's a most powerful message, when it's peaceful like that instead of this destruction,"" Rael said.

ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. — As riots, protests, and racial unrest erupt in cities across the country, Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham said her administration is more interested in keeping protesters safe and allowing their voices to be heard, than in the show of force President Donald Trump urged governors to display at a conference call Monday morning. The Washington Post, which obtained a recording of the call, reports Trump berated the governors, called them “weak” and said they would look like fools if they did not take back the streets. “Militarizing our response is incredibly callous, dangerous and tone deaf…,” Lujan Grisham said in a phone interview with the Journal on Monday. “I think the president is more interested in looking tough himself instead of solving problems, and that’s what these protesters are asking us to do is to commit to solve these problems.” Lujan Grisham, a Democrat, said she was not personally able to respond to the president’s remarks, and the reaction from her fellow governors was mixed. “The message the president wanted the governors to take away is ‘you’re weak if you don’t have a strong show of force’ and again I’m interested in solving people’s problems and doing something about racial inequalities,” she said. “It wasn’t a very effective call for me.”",0.0

Both times the protests began in anger over police violence against black men — in 1992, when four police officers were acquitted of the brutal beating of Rodney King; now, when George Floyd died in Minnesota after a policeman knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes. ""We keep telling ourselves that somehow technology or training will end police misconduct,"" says Jody David Armour, a law professor who studies the intersection of race and the criminal justice system. ""But in this case, we saw that in Minnesota, the police department did a lot of that stuff. And still here we are."" Armour, who has taught at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles since 1995, talked with All Things Considered about how protests have changed in the 28 years since the Rodney King riots. Interview Highlights On the people who are protesting now vs. in 1992 The protests and marches today you see are multiethnic, multicultural, even multigenerational. And the allyship is something that is more pronounced now than it perhaps once was. I think a lot of people, when they saw that video of George Floyd, who weren't in the black community, felt agony. And I think this time around, more people feel that sympathy and empathy for members of the black community and are standing in solidarity with them. On empathy for Rodney King vs. George Floyd I think at the time of the Rodney King beating it was easier to view it as an isolated incident or as a few bad apples. But now, over time, we see a persistent and pervasive pattern. Over years and years. We see Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia, 25-year-old black man jogging and is shot dead. Two prosecutors look at the facts and don't bring any action. Breonna Taylor in Louisville. No-knock raid, wrong house; she's killed. The procession of hashtags that made up the Black Lives Matter movement in the 2014, 2015, 2016 years. I think more and more people are seeing that it isn't just isolated incidents, that there's something more pervasive and more ingrained in America that we have to address. The police officer's knee on the neck of George Floyd for many was a grim symbol of, kind of, America's knee on the neck of black America. On where broader protests go from here My sense of where the protests can go from here, hopefully will go from here, is we'll have a serious reckoning with the racial injustice that has really provoked and continues to provoke these kinds of eruptions. This is this really kind of a generational upheaval. We can either make some serious structural changes, redistribute power and wealth in a way that we haven't been willing to consider in the past. I think more people are willing to consider things like, even just as a result of the coronavirus crisis, things like universal basic income and ""Medicare for All."" I think that as a result of this other kind of crisis — I think that racism is a kind of virus, too, that mutates and changes from time to time, but continues to persist — that we will take on the necessary work of redistributing wealth and power in such a way that we don't have Skid Rows, 75% of which have black faces in them. That we don't make the faces at the bottom of the well always black faces. And we do start to act as a society like black lives matter.

Trump's Rose Garden remarks came as just across the street, law enforcement officers deployed tear gas and shot rubber bullets to forcefully disperse peaceful protesters. Washington, D.C., had set a curfew Monday of 7 p.m. ET. The protesters were removed from the Lafayette Square area across from the White House, apparently to clear the way for the president to walk to St. John's Church, where he posed briefly for photographers, holding a Bible. Parts of the church compound were damaged by rioters on Sunday night. In a statement, Judd Deere, the White House's deputy press secretary, said: ""The perimeter was expanded to help enforce the 7 p.m. curfew in the same area where rioters attempted to burn down one of our nation's most historic churches the night before. Protesters were given three warnings by the U.S. Park Police."" Trump's remarks, which lasted less than seven minutes, came after days of protests in dozens of cities across the U.S. following the death of George Floyd, a black man who died in police custody in Minneapolis a week ago. During the remarks, Trump declared himself ""a law-and-order president"" and ""ally of all peaceful protesters,"" but he called violent unrest that has accompanied many demonstrations ""acts of domestic terror."" ""These are not acts of peaceful protests. These are acts of domestic terror. The destruction of innocent life, and the spilling of innocent blood, is an offense to humanity and a crime against God,"" Trump said. He added: ""Our country always wins. That is why I am taking immediate presidential action to stop the violence."" Trump said he had mobilized ""thousands and thousands"" of ""heavily armed"" military personnel to put an end to the protests, which were born from criticisms of excessive force by law enforcement. It was not immediately clear, however, what precise changes might be in store for the personnel who have been responding to the demonstrations across the country. The Justice Department said in a statement that beginning Monday night, it had deployed all of its law enforcement components and is coordinating with the Department of Defense, the Department of Homeland Security and local authorities to ""maximize federal security presence throughout the District [of Columbia]."" Threatening state governors who have declined to deploy the National Guard, Trump said he would dispatch the U.S. military to ""quickly solve the problem for them."" After the stop at St. John's Church, Trump and a retinue of advisers and staffers then returned to the secure enclave within the White House complex. Nation in crisis Protests, which have at times broken out into violence and looting, continued from the weekend into Monday, following the video-recorded death of Floyd, who died after a white officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes. Protesters — many of whom have worn masks because of the coronavirus pandemic — have demanded that the officers involved be held accountable for Floyd's death. Derek Chauvin, the officer who knelt on Floyd's neck, has been arrested and charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Three other officers who were involved in the incident have been fired but have not been charged. Several major cities, including Washington, D.C., were placed under curfews following the unrest. Trump's walk to the nearby church, which he does not typically visit, technically violated the District of Columbia's Monday curfew for a little time. The National Guard has been deployed in many states, and the president on Monday called for governors to ""dominate"" in their states to put an end to the protests. His remarks Monday stand in stark contrast to the position he took toward heavily armed majority-white protesters last month, who stormed the Michigan statehouse in defiance of stay-at-home orders to demand a reopening of the state economy amid the coronavirus pandemic. Trump described those protesters as ""very good people"" and called on the governor to ""give a little"" to appease them. The protests against police violence come against the backdrop of the coronavirus pandemic, which has caused more than 100,000 deaths in the U.S., with black Americans disproportionately affected.

Copyright © 2020 Albuquerque Journal First there was a candlelight vigil attended by thousands of community members to stand in solidarity with those killed by police. Protesters marched up and down Central chanting “I can’t breathe” and waving signs referencing the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. ADVERTISEMENTSkip ................................................................ Then, nearing midnight, chaos broke out in Downtown Albuquerque. Rioters shattered business windows and damaged other property across multiple Central Avenue blocks and, officials say, broke into the historic KiMo Theatre and climbed onto the roof. Thirty-three fires were set in the area and dozens of firearms were looted from at least one gun store, officials say. Police say shots were fired at them, although they did not provide any more information and no one was injured. Around 11:45 p.m., the Albuquerque Police Department’s Emergency Response Team, wearing riot gear, arrived at the scene. Over the next several hours they tried to get the demonstrators to disperse. A helicopter circled overhead, and officers moved in formation through the streets, throwing tear gas canisters into the group. Some protesters shouted profanities and taunts at the police and threw the canisters back at them. Officers were called off shortly before 5 a.m. Two men were arrested for unlawful assembly and obstructing or evading the police, misdemeanor charges. Jim Harvey, executive director of the Albuquerque Center for Peace and Justice, said he was saddened and disappointed to hear about how the situation unfolded Downtown, but he wasn’t necessarily surprised. However, he said, he doesn’t believe those who attended the candlelight vigil were involved. He said at least 2,000 people attended the vigil at the center near the University of New Mexico and it ended around 7:30 p.m. as protesters began to march, for the most part peacefully. “One of the things we’re continuing to hear a lot about is there are people who are unrelated to and uninterested in the issue and simply want to create more problems,” Harvey said. “I don’t know if that’s necessarily who did damage last night or not, but we will continue to do what we have to do, which is to make our voices heard and raise the issues we are concerned about in a peaceful way.” Harvey referenced the APD’s history with excessive use of force, which prompted the Department of Justice to intervene. The city is still in the midst of the reform effort and officials acknowledge they have a long way to go in changing the police department’s culture. ADVERTISEMENTSkip ................................................................ “It’s all about accountability,” Harvey said. “I think the overarching concern and need even goes beyond local police. I think we need to be talking about a national move to change the culture of policing everywhere, and that just needs to happen.” Damage to businesses Standing in front of the boarded-up KiMo Theatre on Monday, Mayor Tim Keller called the morning’s events an “especially heinous” attack on a business community already struggling to survive the COVID-19-related economic shutdown and blamed it on a “small separate group” from the hundreds who had gathered Sunday evening for a candlelight vigil and march from the UNM area to Downtown and back again. City leaders had not calculated the cost of the damage but said the city will help with board-ups necessary at affected businesses. “Last night was scary and dangerous for everyone involved … and of course it should not have been for anyone,” Keller said. “What we saw last night in Downtown was not a protest. It was not Albuquerque.” Asked if police had been too lenient, Keller said they “intervened as soon as they could in a safe way that would not lead to serious injury. By that measure, because there was no serious injury, I am absolutely grateful.” Keller and other officials in his administration said the police worked to keep protesters safe during the earlier event, with APD even helping keep traffic clear. But what happened afterward required police intervention, Chief Administrative Officer Sarita Nair said. “We need to come together in a way that respects all of the pain and frustration, but it must be in a way that doesn’t endanger lives,” she said. “There’s been a national conversation about riots and whether cities are valuing property over human life. We have deliberately chosen not to take that approach, but events like last night did endanger more than just property.” Although an APD spokesman said early Monday morning that officers reported someone firing at them in front of the KiMo Theatre, Albuquerque Police Department Deputy Chief Harold Medina later said they had not determined the source of the shots. ADVERTISEMENTSkip ................................................................ Nobody was seriously hurt during the chaos, but two people were ultimately arrested on misdemeanor charges, Medina said. One of them, 39-year-old David Ellis, sat on the curb and refused to move as the police line advanced toward him after deploying smoke canisters and gas into the crowd of protesters, according to the complaint. “When the police line reached Mr. Ellis they had to stop their advance because of Mr. Ellis sitting on the curb,” an officer wrote in the complaint. The complaint does not say what the other man, 29-year-old Salomon Cordova, did. Both men were arrested and held for several hours but were later released because the power was out at the Metropolitan Detention Center, said Gilbert Gallegos, an APD spokesman. Clean up Monday morning city workers and volunteers cleaned up the damage to Downtown businesses, removing graffiti and boarding up broken windows. Several Downtown business owners said they don’t blame the vandalism on peaceful protestors. Effex Nightclub had several windows broken, but owner Carri Phillis said it does not appear vandals made their way into the club. She said she was told this morning that each time it seemed someone was about to enter the building bystanders intervened. ADVERTISEMENTSkip ................................................................ “These were not protesters that destroyed Downtown,” she said. “These were a bunch of punks and all they wanted to do was commit crimes in the city.” Phillis said that she hopes the vandals don’t detract from the movement, which she said she supports. “As far as what happened last night, that does not change the narrative for me and I truly hope that it does not change the narrative for others,” she said. As of Monday afternoon, the nightclub was fully boarded up. “The irony is next weekend we should be celebrating our 10-year anniversary and today we are boarding up our windows,” Phillis said. The Box Theater at Gold and Second had rocks thrown through several windows and a door kicked in at about 2 a.m. Monday, according to co-owner Doug Montoya. Although the damage will cost a few thousand dollars to repair, Montoya said he views the damage as a consequence of systemic issues. “I don’t even know that I am upset that they broke the windows. I’m just kind of at ease with it because it seems par for the course,” he said. “This seems appropriate that people are going to be angry, they’re gonna, you know, protest.” For now, Montoya said he’s planning on keeping the windows boarded up while protests continue. Other buildings in the area also took precautions. Metropolitan Court in Downtown Albuquerque closed early as a precautionary measure to allow employees time to safely leave the area. ADVERTISEMENTSkip ................................................................ Windows were boarded up at Silver Street Market as well. Co-owner Kelly Ortman said only two windows were damaged but the grocery store made the decision to preemptively cover all exposed windows to prevent potential damage from future protests. She says the damage to her business was minimal compared to others in the area. “It’s sad,” Ortman said. “I know that these were not the demonstrators, it was just opportunists.” -Journal staff writer Anthony Jackson contributed to this report.",0.0

My fellow Americans, my first and highest duty as president, is to defend our great country and the American people. I sworn oath to uphold the laws of our nation, and that is exactly what I will do. All Americans were rightly sickened and revolted by the brutal death of George Floyd. My administration is fully committed that for George and his family justice will be served. He will not have died in vain, but we cannot allow the righteous cries and peaceful protesters to be drown out by an angry mob. The biggest victims off the rioting are peace loving citizens in our poorest communities. And is there President? I will fight to keep them safe. I will fight to protect you. I am your president of Law and Order and an ally of all peaceful protesters. But in recent days, our nation has been gripped by professional anarchists, violent mobs, arsonists, looters, criminals, riders, antifa and others. A number of state and local governments have failed to take necessary action to safeguard their residents. Innocent people have been savagely beaten, like the young man in Dallas, Texas, who was left dying on the street or the woman in upstate New York viciously attacked by dangerous thugs. Small business owners have seen their dreams utterly destroyed. New York's finest have been hit in the face with bricks. Brave nurses who have battled the virus are afraid to leave their homes. A police precinct has been overrun. Here in the nation's capital, the Lincoln Memorial and the World War Two Memorial has been vandalized. One of our most historic churches was set ablaze. A federal officer in California, an African American enforcement hero, was shot and killed. These air not acts of peaceful protests. These are acts of domestic terror. The destruction of innocent life and the spilling of innocent blood is an offense to humanity and a crime against God. America needs creation, not destruction. Cooperation, not contempt. Security, not anarchy. Healing, not hatred, justice, not chaos. This is our mission, and we will succeed 100%. We will succeed. Our country always wins. That is why I am taking immediate presidential action to stop the violence and restore security and safety in America. I am mobilizing all available Federal resource is civilian and military to stop the rioting and looting to end the destruction and arson and to protect the rights of law abiding Americans, including your Second Amendment rights. Therefore, the following measures air going into effect immediately. First, we are ending the riots and lawlessness that has spread throughout our country. We will end it now. Today. I have strongly recommended to every governor to deploy the National Guard insufficient numbers that we dominate the streets. Mayors and governors must establish an overwhelming law enforcement presence until the violence has been quelled. If a city or state refuses to take the actions that are necessary to defend the life and property of their residents, then I will deploy the United States military and quickly solve the problem for them. I am also taking swift and decisive action to protect our great capital, Washington, D. C. What happened in the city last night was a total disgrace. As we speak, I am dispatching thousands and thousands of heavily armed soldiers, military personnel and law enforcement offices to stop the rioting, looting, vandalism, assaults and the wanton destruction of property. We're putting everybody on warning are seven oclock curfew will be strictly enforced. Those who threaten innocent life and property will be arrested detained and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. I want the organizer's of this terror to be unnoticed, that you will face severe criminal penalties and lengthy sentences in jail. This includes Antifa and others who are leading instigators of this violence. One law and order and that is what it is. One law. We have one beautiful law and once that is restored and fully restored, we will help you. We will help your business and we will help your family. America is founded upon the rule of law. It is the foundation of our prosperity, our freedom and our very way of life. But where there is no law, there is no opportunity where there is no justice, there is no liberty. Where there is no safety, there is no future. We must never given to anger or hatred. If malice or violence reigns that none of us is free. I take these actions today with firm resolve and with a true and passionate love for our country. By far our greatest days. Lie ahead. Thank you very much. And now I'm going to pay my respects to a very, very special place. Thank you very much.

John Cornyn, also a member of Senate GOP leadership, told CNN that ""I think it's important"" for Trump to offer more of a unifying message in the midst of the deep unrest across the county.""I presume at some point he will address the nation,"" said Cornyn of Texas. ""If I were advising him I would say we need it sooner rather than later.""At a time when Trump could be consoling the nation, Republicans — who rarely break from Trump — are voicing their disapproval that the president has offered little in the way of condolences and instead taken to Twitter to incite divisions and cast blame.""Some of his tweets have not been helpful,"" Sen. Pat Toomey, a Republican from Pennsylvania, said at a news conference Monday. ""It would be helpful if he would change the tone of his message.""The message from his own party comes as protests have grown and spread throughout the country from Los Angeles to Washington.""We are obviously in a divisive situation right now that is escalating. ... He needs to make more unifying comments,"" said Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, a Republican from West Virginia.Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, speaking on the Senate floor, called on Trump ""to help heal the racial division.""""The president should help to heal the racial divisions in this country,"" Collins said. ""It is at times like this that a president needs to speak to the nation, to pledge to right wrongs and to calm inflamed passions.""Asked later if she thinks the president needs to offer a unifying message, Collins said: ""I do.""Sen. Cory Gardner, who like Collins is facing reelection next year, didn't criticize Trump directly but added: ""We all have to do better every day — we have to.""On Friday, the president's handling of the situation came under more scrutiny after he tweeted, ""When the looting starts, the shooting starts,"" a phrase that originated from controversial Miami police chief Walter Headley at the height of the civil rights movement. Headley, who defended practices like using police dogs and force, said at news conference ""We don't mind being accused of police brutality,"" according to an article from the period in The New York Times.""Those are not constructive tweets without any question,"" Sen. Tim Scott, the only black Republican in the U.S. Senate, told Fox on Sunday. ""I will say this, I spoke with the president (Saturday) morning, and he and I had a good conversation about the next steps. I told him, what I am going to tell you. I told him 'Mr. President, it helps us when you focus on the death, the unjustified in my opinion, the criminal death of George Floyd.'""On Monday during a private call with governors, the president continued to blast others for what has unfolded, accusing some states of being weak and arguing that law enforcement needed to ""dominate"" protestors in order to contain the demonstrations in cities across the country.""You have to dominate or you'll look like a bunch of jerks, you have to arrest and try people,"" the president told the governors in a call from the basement White House Situation Room, according to an audio recording of the call obtained by CNN.Majority Leader Mitch McConnell wouldn't answer questions Monday about whether he believed Trump had struck the appropriate tone in his handling of the unrest. Others also declined to comment about Trump's tweets, including Sen. David Perdue of Georgia, who faces voters in the fall.""Well, obviously this is an evolving situation — I think this is a difficult position the president is in,"" said Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida when asked if Trump should shift his tone to emphasize unity. On Monday, McConnell demonstrated a starkly different tone from the president from the floor of the Senate.""In no world, whatsoever, should arresting a man for an alleged minor infraction involve a police officer putting his knee on a man's neck for nine minutes while he cries out 'I can't breathe' and then goes silent,"" McConnell said. ""To me, to a great many of my fellow Kentuckians and to many outraged Americans, these disturbing events do not look like three isolated incidents, they look more like the latest chapter in our national struggle to make equal justice and equal protection of the law into facts of life for all Americans.""",0.0

It doesn’t go away, and when you have somebody in power who breathes oxygen into the hate under the rocks, it comes out from under the rocks,” Biden told more than a dozen African American leaders gathered at a church in downtown Wilmington, his face mask lowered around his chin as he spoke.Without offering specifics, he promised to “deal with institutional racism” and set up a police oversight body in his first 100 days in office, if elected. Biden also said he'd be releasing an economic plan focused on education, housing and “access to capital"" and investments, especially for minority Americans, later this month. “I really do believe that the blinders have been taken off. I think this tidal wave is moving,” Biden told the mayors of Atlanta, Chicago, Los Angeles and St. Paul, Minnesota. “I realize we’ve got to do something big, we can do it, and everyone will benefit from it.”Biden has struggled in recent weeks to be heard from his makeshift home TV studio over the noise of dueling national crises. But after another night of violent protests, he ventured out into public for the second time in two days and just the third time since the pandemic arrived in mid March.His hopeful and collaborative approach marked a sharp contrast to that of President Donald Trump. The Republican president slammed governors as “weak” during a video teleconference on Monday and demanded tougher crackdowns on protesters. Trump also lashed out at Biden on Twitter, writing that “Sleepy Joe Biden’s people are so Radical Left that they are working to get the Anarchists out of jail, and probably more.”Biden's softer style may foreshadow how he presents himself in the five months before the presidential election, emphasizing calm and competence as a contrast to a mercurial president. It is an approach that carries the risk of being drowned out by Trump's much louder voice. “He’s not in office, and he certainly does not have the megaphone like the person currently occupying the White House does, but I do think our people are looking for someone who can make them feel better during these extremely tough times,” said Rep. Val Demings of Florida, whom Biden is considering as a running mate. “America just needs to be reassured that there’s someone who’s understanding, someone who’s willing to say, ‘Yes, we do have some issues,’ and someone who’s willing to address it.”Biden delivered a well-received address on Friday calling on white people to shoulder the responsibility of ending America’s systemic racism. But he was largely out of sight over the weekend, which marked the fifth anniversary of the death of his son Beau Biden from brain cancer.Biden and his wife, Jill, marked Memorial Day by laying a wreath at a veterans' memorial near his Wilmington home, and the former vice president’s campaign posted pictures of him visiting a protest site in the city on Sunday afternoon. Earlier, he wrote a post on Medium expressing empathy for those despairing about the police killing of George Floyd.In the early moments of Monday’s gathering at the Bethel AME church in Wilmington, Biden listened quietly and took notes. All the attendees, including Biden, wore face masks but lowered them as they spoke.“The vice president came to hear from us. This is a homeboy,” pastor Sylvester Beaman said before everyone bowed their heads in prayer.Biden's standing with the black community weighs heavily as he works to deny Trump a second term. African Americans rescued Biden's flailing primary campaign, but it's unclear if they will turn out for him in large numbers in November. “I want to make something clear. I don’t expect anything from the black community,"" Biden said Monday, insisting he has never taken its support for granted. The former vice president has been doing cleanup since telling a prominent black radio host a week and a half ago that African Americans who back Trump “ain’t black.”Yet the mayors who spoke with Biden, three of whom are black, were clearly frustrated and angry with Trump, who has offered military support to address violent protests while denying them federal support to address the coronavirus fallout and repeatedly attacking them on social media. “To see the president of the United States say that he's going to send the military into our communities but hadn't mentioned sending a single dime of support into our communities, speaks to where we are in America,” said Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms. Much of Biden's campaign strategy centers on trying to draw a contrast with Trump on temperament and values. He has called the White House contest a battle for the soul of the nation and has been particularly forceful in condemning Trump's handling of moments of racial tension. In an election that is likely to be a referendum on the sitting president, some Biden aides say privately that the best plan may be to let Trump do himself in.Yet there is also a recognition that Biden needs to do more than simply wait for voters who may be turned off by Trump to turn toward him. Some Democrats who have criticized Biden for not being more visible during the onset of the coronavirus said he is making the right moves now.“I’m sure they have some reluctance, understandably, right now to politicize it. That's not who he is,"" said Democratic strategist James Carville. “There might be a time for eloquence, but I think that simplicity is eloquence right now.”",0.0

Rioters shattered business windows and damaged other property across multiple Central Avenue blocks and, officials say, broke into the historic KiMo Theatre and climbed onto the roof. Thirty-three fires were set in the area and dozens of firearms were looted from at least one gun store, officials say. Police say shots were fired at them, although they did not provide any more information and no one was injured. Around 11:45 p.m. the Albuquerque Police Department’s Emergency Response Team, wearing riot gear, arrived at the scene. Over the next several hours they tried to get the demonstrators to disperse. A helicopter circled overhead, and officers moved in formation through the streets, throwing tear gas canisters into the group. Some protesters shouted profanities and taunts at the police and threw the canisters back at them. Officers were called off shortly before 5 a.m. Two men were arrested for unlawful assembly and obstructing or evading the police, misdemeanor charges. Jim Harvey, executive director of the Albuquerque Center for Peace and Justice, said he was saddened and disappointed to hear about how the situation unfolded Downtown, but he wasn’t necessarily surprised. However, he said, he doesn’t believe those who attended the candlelight vigil were involved. He said at least 2,000 people attended the vigil at the center near the University of New Mexico and it ended around 7:30 p.m. as protesters began to march, for the most part peacefully. “One of the things we’re continuing to hear a lot about is there are people who are unrelated to and uninterested in the issue, and simply want to create more problems,” Harvey said. “I don’t know if that’s necessarily who did damage last night or not, but we will continue to do what we have to do, which is to make our voices heard and raise the issues we are concerned about in a peaceful way.” Harvey referenced the APD’s history with excessive use of force, which prompted the Department of Justice to intervene. The city is still in the midst of the reform effort and officials acknowledge they have a long way to go in changing the police department’s culture. “It’s all about accountability,” Harvey said. “I think the overarching concern and need even goes beyond local police. I think we need to be talking about a national move to change the culture of policing everywhere.” ADVERTISEMENTSkip ................................................................ ‘It was not Albuquerque’ Standing in front of the boarded-up KiMo Theatre on Monday, Mayor Tim Keller called the morning’s events an “especially heinous” attack on a business community already struggling to survive the COVID-19-related economic shutdown and blamed it on a small, separate group from the hundreds who gathered Sunday evening for a candlelight vigil and march from the UNM area to Downtown and back again. City leaders had not calculated the cost of the damage, but said the city will help with board-ups at affected businesses. “Last night was scary and dangerous for everyone involved … and, of course, it should not have been for anyone,” Keller said. “What we saw last night in Downtown was not a protest. It was not Albuquerque.” Asked if police had been too lenient, Keller said they “intervened as soon as they could in a safe way that would not lead to serious injury. By that measure, because there was no serious injury, I am absolutely grateful.” Keller and other officials said the police worked to keep protesters safe during the earlier event, with APD even helping keep traffic clear. But what happened afterward required police intervention, Chief Administrative Officer Sarita Nair said. “We need to come together in a way that respects all of the pain and frustration, but it must be in a way that doesn’t endanger lives,” she said. “There’s been a national conversation about riots and whether cities are valuing property over human life. We have deliberately chosen not to take that approach, but events like last night did endanger more than just property.” An APD spokesman said early Monday morning that officers reported someone firing at them in front of the KiMo Theatre. Albuquerque Police Department Deputy Chief Harold Medina later said they didn’t know who shot at them or from which direction they fired. Nobody was seriously hurt during the chaos, but two people were arrested on misdemeanor charges, Medina said. One of them, 39-year-old David Ellis, sat on the curb and refused to move as the police line advanced toward him after deploying smoke canisters and gas into the crowd of protesters, according to the complaint. ADVERTISEMENTSkip ................................................................ “When the police line reached Mr. Ellis, they had to stop their advance because of Mr. Ellis sitting on the curb,” an officer wrote in the complaint. The complaint does not say what the other man, 29-year-old Salomon Cordova, did. Both men were arrested and held for several hours, but were later released because the power was out at the Metropolitan Detention Center, said Gilbert Gallegos, an APD spokesman. A consequence of systemic issues On Monday morning, city workers and volunteers cleaned up the damage to Downtown businesses, removing graffiti and boarding up broken windows. Several Downtown business owners said they don’t blame the vandalism on peaceful protestors. Effex Nightclub had several windows broken, but owner Carri Phillis said it does not appear vandals made their way into the club. She said she was told this morning that each time it seemed someone was about to enter the building, bystanders intervened. “These were not protesters that destroyed Downtown,” she said. “These were a bunch of punks and all they wanted to do was commit crimes in the city.” ADVERTISEMENTSkip ................................................................ Phillis said that she hopes the vandals don’t detract from the movement, which she said she supports. “As far as what happened last night, that does not change the narrative for me and I truly hope that it does not change the narrative for others,” she said. As of Monday afternoon, the nightclub was fully boarded up. “The irony is next weekend we should be celebrating our 10-year anniversary and today we are boarding up our windows,” Phillis said. The Box Theater at Gold and Second had rocks thrown through several windows and a door kicked in at about 2 a.m. Monday, according to co-owner Doug Montoya. Although the damage will cost a few thousand dollars to repair, Montoya said he views the damage as a consequence of systemic issues. “I don’t even know that I am upset that they broke the windows. I’m just kind of at ease with it because it seems par for the course,” he said. “This seems appropriate that people are going to be angry … .” Montoya said he’s planning on keeping the windows boarded up while protests continue. Other buildings in the area also took precautions. Metropolitan Court in Downtown Albuquerque closed early as a precautionary measure to allow employees time to safely leave the area. Windows were boarded up at Silver Street Market, as well. Co-owner Kelly Ortman said only two windows were damaged, but the grocery store made the decision to cover all exposed windows to prevent potential damage from future protests. She says the damage to her business was minimal compared to others in the area.

However, she said, protests and riots are a “serious public safety issue,” and the risk of spreading coronavirus at the gatherings is high. She said she was encouraged to hear that the vast majority of people at the earlier peaceful protest were wearing masks. While Albuquerque’s melees have resulted in damage to businesses and police property, no injuries have been reported. Lujan Grisham said this speaks well of the progress New Mexico has made in addressing the issues. “One broken window, one police officer attack is one attack too many, and they’re really unforgivable acts when we’re trying to bring attention and respect for the lives lost, and tragedies that have occurred,” Lujan Grisham said. “… None of it is acceptable, but compared with what we’re witnessing around the world and around the country … I think it speaks volumes that we came a long way in New Mexico, we are open and we recognize we have a long way to go.

And then it became clear. President Trump wanted to walk from the White House through the park to the Episcopal church. Camera crews scrambled to keep up with him as he strode through the park, followed by his daughter Ivanka and her husband, Jared Kushner, along with Attorney General William Barr and other administration officials. Trump stopped briefly outside the church and held up a Bible. ""We have the greatest country in the world,"" he said. ""Keep it nice and safe."" The visit came just after Trump delivered remarks at the White House, declaring himself ""your president of law and order"" and demanding that governors deploy National Guard units and ""dominate the streets."" St. John's Church opened in 1816 and is known as ""the Church of the Presidents,"" having hosted every U.S. president since James Madison. On this occasion, however, the president's visit was unannounced, and church authorities were furious that the White House did not bother to alert them. ""There was no reaching out, no sense that it would require some sort of authorization before using the church as a backdrop in that way,"" said the Right Rev. Mariann Edgar Budde, Episcopal bishop of Washington, with oversight responsibilities for the church. When the president held up the Bible, without praying or quoting a verse appropriate for the moment, Budde was further incensed. ""It almost looked like a prop,"" she told NPR. ""That is the most sacred text of the Judeo-Christian tradition. It speaks messages of love, of God, love of neighbor. I was outraged that he felt that he had the license to do that, and that he would abuse our sacred symbols and our sacred space in that way."" The church has long been known for its support of social justice causes, and in the hours before the president showed up, clergy and lay volunteers had been ministering to the protesters in the plaza. Protests, some of them violent, had occurred around the church on previous nights, and the church was briefly in danger on Sunday after a fire started in the church basement. The Bible teaches us to love God and our neighbor; that all people are beloved children of God; that we are to do justice and love kindness. The President used our sacred text as a symbol of division. — Mariann Budde (@Mebudde) June 2, 2020 A former St. John's minister, Gini Gerbasi, was among those attending to the protesters in front of the church when the police moved in. ""We were literally DRIVEN OFF of the St. John's, Lafayette Square patio with tear gas and concussion grenades and police in full riot gear,"" she wrote in a Facebook post. ""PEOPLE WERE HURT SO THAT [President Trump] COULD HAVE A PHOTO OPPORTUNITY IN FRONT OF THE CHURCH!!! HE WOULD HAVE HAD TO STEP OVER THE MEDICAL SUPPLIES WE LEFT BEHIND BECAUSE WE WERE BEING TEAR GASSED!!!!"" In a statement Monday evening, the Episcopal Church Presiding Bishop Michael Curry joined in the criticism of Trump's visit. ""This evening, the President of the United States stood in front of St. John's Episcopal Church, lifted up a bible, and had pictures of himself taken,"" Curry said. ""In so doing, he used a church building and the Holy Bible for partisan political purposes. This was done in a time of deep hurt and pain in our country, and his action did nothing to help us or to heal us."" The church visit was praised, however, by a member of Trump's Evangelical Advisory Board, the Rev. Johnnie Moore.

The situation has escalated rapidly nationwide since the Memorial Day death of George Floyd, killed as a Minneapolis police officer dug a knee into the back of his neck for nearly nine minutes as he was facedown on the ground, handcuffed behind his back, pleading he couldn’t breathe. It began with a report of Floyd trying to use a counterfeit $20 bill to buy cigarettes and has become the latest example of police brutality against African Americans. Video of Floyd’s death has rocked the nation and reignited the tinderbox of racial tensions across America, which was already on edge with more than 100,000 COVID-19-related deaths nationwide and months of isolation and stay-at-home orders that have wrecked lives and livelihoods. Floyd’s death follows the Feb. 23 death of Ahmaud Arbery, a 25-year-old African American who was jogging before he was shot dead during a confrontation with a father and son in Brunswick, Georgia. Murder charges have been leveled in both cases but have done little to quell decades of justified frustration, fear and anger at far too many similar killings. Albuquerque Police Chief Mike Geier said during a news conference Monday afternoon at our rioting’s ground zero that the Albuquerque Police Department deployed emergency response teams to a large portion of Downtown late Sunday to stop those vandalizing property and getting violent with police. Officers reported someone fired shots at them in front of the KiMo Theater – boarded up Monday afternoon – and one man threw what appeared to be a Molotov cocktail toward police. Early Monday afternoon, city crews were still cleaning up graffiti and broken glass along the Central corridor. At a time when leadership is imperative to bring the country together and stop the violence, President Donald Trump’s tweets have been anything but helpful, referring to the Minneapolis protesters as “THUGS” and sharing that “When the looting starts, the shooting starts.” After Secret Service agents rushed him to a White House bunker Friday night as hundreds of protesters gathered outside, he tweeted that if protesters had breached the White House fence, they would “have been greeted with the most vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons, I have ever seen.” And this brings the nation together how, exactly? Keller has attempted to strike a conciliatory tone with those angered by police brutality, rightfully calling the deaths of Floyd, Arbery and Breonna Taylor in Kentucky “horrifying, heart-breaking and unacceptable.” Geier said Sunday the actions of the Minneapolis officers involved in Floyd’s death were “inconsistent with the training and protocols of our department.” We should certainly hope so. APD remains under a federal settlement agreement for violating civil rights with misuse of force. Some of the most insightful comments, and actions, in recent days have come from an unlikely source, UFC light heavyweight champion Jon “Bones” Jones, who lives in Albuquerque. The embattled mixed martial arts champ who stands 6-foot-4 with an 84 1/2-inch reach confronted rioters Sunday night, taking cans of spray paint away from demonstrators. Jones posted on Instagram the demonstration had lost its meaning when it turned destructive. “As a young black man trust me I’m frustrated as well but this is not the way, we are starting to make a bad situation worse If you got love for your city (505), protect your (expletive). All you old heads need to speak up, call your young family members and tell them to come home tonight.” Well said. As of Monday morning, the Instagram post had more than 750,000 views. ADVERTISEMENTSkip ................................................................ The level of violence nationwide appears to be increasing daily as peaceful protests are tarnished by those hellbent on destruction. That was the case in Albuquerque. Both the governor and Keller should act quickly and decisively to stem the violence before someone is seriously injured here, or worse. Unfortunately, that means calling up the National Guard and instituting a curfew in the Duke City. Keller pointed out Monday police and peaceful protesters worked together Sunday evening – with police closing intersections to make way for the marchers. That’s the way it should work. Fast forward when a different group took to the streets and mayhem ensued. APD does not have the resources to man the streets 24/7 waiting for rioters to appear. Remember earlier Sunday, APD had to deal with an hours-long active shooter situation that forced the shutdown of both Interstates 25 and 40, along with an interstate rollover accident. Minnesota Democratic Gov. Tim Walz activated up to 13,200 National Guard troops to control protesters in Minneapolis after the city’s initial back-off strategy resulted in a violent free-for-all. Cities from San Francisco to New York have instituted curfews. Bolstering APD’s officer-power with National Guard troops and implementing a curfew at sundown will allow protests and marches to continue, while keeping the streets safe when darkness falls.

USA TODAY Editor's note: This story was updated June 2, 2020 to reflect a correction in a paraphrase of Eddy County Sheriff Mark Cage's May 28 Facebook post. In the post, Cage says the actions of the officer which resulted in the death of George Floyd were ""unconscionable and not rooted in ANY type of law enforcement training I’ve ever been exposed to."" The original report's paraphrase mistakenly characterized Floyd's death as accidental. After watching video of George Floyd’s fatal arrest in Minneapolis, 21-year-old Aldyn Hutchins and 22-year-old Micah Calderon knew that they had to do something. The two friends took to the streets on Thursday outside the Eddy County Courthouse in downtown Carlsbad, holding up signs and calling for justice. They organized a second demonstration the following Saturday, with Hutchins' girlfriend Kylinda Rodriguez, and drew about 80 participants, mostly younger than 25. Floyd, an African American man, was killed May 25 during his arrest while officers from the Minneapolis Police Department responded to a report of counterfeit money. Minneapolis Police officer Derek Chauvin knelt on Floyd’s neck in the roadway for about nine minutes despite pleas from Floyd that he couldn’t breathe. MORE: What we know about the death of George Floyd Floyd was later pronounced dead, and Chauvin was arrested and charged with 3rd degree murder. Protests, violence erupt across U.S. The incident sparked two days of protests across the U.S. in major cities from New York to Los Angeles, as demonstrators expressed anger over the incident many saw as racially motivated. Some protests turned violent, as participants damaged property and clashed with police. MORE: George Floyd protest live updates: Trump calls governors 'weak'; prison riot teams deployed to DC; police cars burn in NYC Curfews were enacted in Minneapolis and other major cities, and police reportedly used force on residents to enforce such mandates. The events were widely shared via social media, as many argued that police had become corrupted by bigotry and violence while others characterized the demonstrators as anarchists. President Donald Trump, while voicing concern over Floyd’s death and calling for a federal investigation, condemned protesters as many gathered near the White House and seemed to encourage counter protesters in Washington, D.C. PREVIOUSLY: White House locked down as protests over Floyd's death reach capital “The professionally managed so-called “protesters” at the White House had little to do with the memory of George Floyd. They were just there to cause trouble. The @SecretService handled them easily.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 30, 2020 But in Carlsbad, Hutchins said the demonstration largely remained peaceful, as a man confronting the protesters and using racial slurs quickly left the area. Demonstrators gathered on the courthouse lawn from about 7:30 to 9:30 that night, holding a nine-minute moment of silence to symbolize the amount of time Floyd’s neck was pinned to the ground by officer before his death. “We emphasized that we wanted it to be peaceful,” Hutchins said. “Coming from Carlsbad, I support our law enforcement. We wanted to show our support (with other demonstrators) but not tear down our city.” 'We want to see the change' Demonstrators protest the death of George Floyd, an African American man who was killed by police officers, May 30, 2020 at the Eddy County Courthouse in Carlsbad. (Photo: Amanda Esposito | Esposito Photography) Hutchins said he was shocked to see the video of Floyd’s arrest, and that it changed his perspective on racial injustice occurring throughout the nation. He said rural communities like Carlsbad often hold the misconception that racism is not present, and only an issue in bigger cities. “We want it to be known that it’s happening. Even in our small rural community, it’s here,” he said. “That was the first time I’d heard the N-word used in hate. It was pretty intense. It changed some perspective for me.” “I’m a supporter of law enforcement, but this needs to be stopped. Police need to take more classes and do more training. It’s real. It was brutal.” Aldyn Hutchins, protest organizer While he does support law enforcement, Hutchins said racism has been apparent at departments across the country and often leads to police brutality. “I am a big believer that this is happening to everybody, all colors,” Hutchins said. ""I’m a supporter of law enforcement, but this needs to be stopped. Police need to take more classes and do more training. It’s real. It was brutal.” Support local journalism. Subscribe to the Carlsbad Current-Argus. The youth present at the protest was a sign, Hutchins said, that young adults are increasingly calling for change, growing up in the age of social media and more exposed to the incidents of racial injustice around the country. “We’re building a future for ourselves,” he said. “We want to see the change. The younger generation is very open. They want to see change.” It’s a trend Calderon said has led to more activism by his age group, remembering the death of Trayvon Martin, a Black teenager who was killed by George Zimmerman while walking home in his Sanford, Florida, neighborhood in 2012. MORE: George Floyd video adds to trauma: 'When is the last time you saw a white person killed online?' Martin’s death brought on a similar outcry of racial injustice, and Calderon, who was 14 at the time, said it was the first time many of today’s young adults saw the horrors of racial violence. “We as the younger generation have seen these types of videos. It’s just too many times that we’ve seen this. It just keeps happening,” he said. “Seeing it on social media, we felt kind of helpless. We really want to see conditions improve for minorities, Black Americans. Even if we’re not Black, we still want to show our support.” In the future, Calderon said he hoped to open a dialogue with local law enforcement, and said he was “hurt” that the Eddy County Sheriff’s Office and Carlsbad Police Department did not participate in Saturday’s demonstration. “When you see other departments marching with demonstrations, it suggests they support the community,” he said. “Complacency equals complicity. When our departments don’t want to get involved, it seems like fear. We don’t want anything negative, but we do want to communicate and have conversation.” Eddy County, Carlsbad leaders speak out In a Thursday Facebook post, Eddy County Sheriff Mark Cage said Floyd’s race should not be the focus of the incident. MORE: Police across US speak out against Minneapolis police in George Floyd death “We need to stop making this about race. A HUMAN BEING lost his life in a needless manner,” Cage wrote. “If the officer who caused his death was racist, then so be it. That’s despicable and compounds the crime, but I don’t believe it should be the focus. “I have no idea what it feels like to be a black person. I’m white. I get it. But cops come in all colors and nationalities and just because there are some bad eggs in the basket that are brutal and predatory doesn’t mean that everyone in the profession sucks.” Carlsbad Mayor Dale Janway said some of the protesters were high school students, and commended them for holding a peaceful event while condemning racism. ""The current and former students who gathered on the courthouse lawn Saturday night were peacefully exercising their right to free speech as they held a demonstration and vigil for the brutal and tragic death of George Floyd,"" Janway said. ""The Carlsbad Police Department intervened at the scene to make sure our students who were protesting were protected. We are thankful the students who showed up at the courthouse lawn provided an example on how to push for positive change. To everyone, please pray for America.""

Reuters reports flared demonstrators vented their anger over the killing of George Floyd by policeman Derek Chauvin. Floyd was an African American man who died in Minneapolis this week after a white police officer knelt on his neck. From Minneapolis to New York City, Atlanta, and Washington, protesters clashed with law enforcement over the treatment of minorities by the police. Prosecutors announced Friday that Chavin had been arrested on third-degree murder and manslaughter charges. Wochit ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. – The mayor of New Mexico’s largest city is blaming small groups of what he called agitators for violence that broke out hours after hundreds of people gathered for a largely peaceful protest in downtown Albuquerque. Dozens of small fires were set, windows were broken and police officers say they were fired upon early Monday in front of the historic Kimo Theater. Police were responding after the building’s windows were broken and some people got on the roof. Police moved in because they were afraid the building would be set on fire. Another group tried later to force a confrontation with police but ended up leaving. The latest: George Floyd vigil planned for Monday by Branigan Library Mayor Tim Keller said there dozens of firearms looted from at least one gun shop and that there was damage to numerous locally-owned coffee shops, breweries and restaurants along the Central Avenue corridor. He said he was grateful no one was seriously injured. While Albuquerque welcomes the right to protest, Keller said gunfire and violence cross the line. “What we saw last night in downtown was not a protest, it was not Albuquerque,” he said. “Protesting is our constitutional right as Americans. We have the strongest voice when we come together and use it as one and express our outrage.” In this May 31, 2020, photo, demonstrators hold a moment of silence at the Civic Plaza in Albuquerque, N.M. after marching along the city's historic Route 66, protesting the death of George Floyd in Minnesota.

(Photo: Russell ContrerasAP) City crews spent the morning boarding up broken windows as other workers picked up debris and cleaned off graffiti. On Sunday evening, several hundred people took part in a march along historic Route 66 in protest of the death of George Floyd, the black man who died after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck even after he stopped moving and pleading for air. The protesters held signs, wore masks and chanted: “Say his name: George Floyd” and “Hands up, don’t shoot.” When the crowd arrived on the western edge of downtown Sunday evening, they stopped, raised their fists into the air and held a moment of silence for Floyd that was followed by cheers. More: George Floyd died from 'asphyxiation from sustained pressure,' family autopsy finds Activist Arthur Bell, 35, later told fellow demonstrators he was “tired of being peaceful.” He said his black skin makes him a target for police and that he is fed up with the situation. Another protest was planned for Monday evening outside police headquarters. Bell said that demonstration would be different. When The Associated Press asked what he meant, Bell said: “A general never gives out his tactics.” While elected leaders in other states have been forced to call out the National Guard, Albuquerque officials said there are no plans to make such a request unless the situation descends into chaos. The mayor said officials will do whatever they can to keep it from getting to that point and he asked for the public’s help. “We can do this without violence on our own city and without more violence on each other,” Keller said. City officials also talked about court-mandated efforts over the past several years to restructure the police department, changes to the way it deals with excessive force and the inclusion of anti-racism and ethics training for police officers and all city employees.

Michelle Lujan Grisham in a statement Monday afternoon condemned the violence in Albuquerque, saying she was concerned that a small group of people “took a wrong turn.” “That sort of behavior is an attempt to distort the important work of the peaceful protesters – who have every right to demonstrate in peace – and puts both the protesters and public safety officers at risk,” she said. “Those individuals, I have complete confidence, will be held accountable. There is no place in this moment for hijacking the protesters’ message of justice and non-violence.” Albuquerque police said two people were arrested overnight on misdemeanor charges.

Act fast!” One day after a crackdown on peaceful protesters near the White House, thousands of demonstrators massed a block away from the presidential mansion, facing law enforcement personnel standing behind a black chain-link fence. The fence was put up overnight to block access to Lafayette Park, just across the street from the White House. “Last night pushed me way over the edge,” said Jessica DeMaio, 40, of Washington, who attended a Floyd protest Tuesday for the first time. “Being here is better than being at home feeling helpless.” The crowd remained in place after the city’s 7 p.m. curfew passed, defying warnings that the response from law enforcement could be even more forceful. But the protest lacked the tension of the previous nights’ demonstrations. The crowd Tuesday was peaceful, even polite. At one point, the crowd booed when a protester climbed a light post and took down a street sign. A chant went up: “Peaceful protest!” On Monday, law enforcement officers on foot and horseback aggressively drove protesters away from Lafayette Park, clearing the way for President Donald Trump to do a photo op at nearby St. John’s Church. On Tuesday, pastors at the church prayed with demonstrators and handed out water bottles. Protests ranged across the U.S., including in Los Angeles, Miami, St. Paul, Minnesota, Columbia, South Carolina, and Houston, where the police chief talked to peaceful demonstrators, vowing reforms. “God as my witness, change is coming,” Art Acevedo said. “And we’re going to do it the right way.” In New York, midtown Manhattan was pocked with battered storefronts after Monday’s protests. Macy’s flagship store was among those hit when crowds of people smashed windows and looted stores as they swept through the area. Police made nearly 700 arrests and Mayor Bill de Blasio extended an 8 p.m. curfew all week. ADVERTISEMENTSkip ................................................................ “We’re going to have a tough few days,” he warned, but added: “We’re going to beat it back.” He pleaded with community leaders to step forward and “create peace.” Thousands of protesters marched Tuesday night in a string of demonstrations across Manhattan and Brooklyn after merchants boarded up their businesses, fearing a repeat of the night before. Many people remained on the streets after the curfew hour. Police eventually ordered them to move along and began taking some into custody. More than 20,000 National Guard members have been called up in 29 states to deal with the violence. New York is not among them, and de Blasio has said he does not want the Guard. On Tuesday, Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo called what happened in the city “a disgrace.” “The NYPD and the mayor did not do their job last night,” Cuomo said at a briefing in Albany. He said the mayor underestimated the problem, and the nation’s largest police force was not deployed in sufficient numbers, though the city had said it doubled the usual police presence. Tuesday marked the eighth straight night of the protests, which began in Minneapolis, where Floyd died, and quickly spread across the country. The mother of George Floyd’s 6-year-old daughter, Gianna, said she wanted the world to know that her little girl lost a good father. “I want everybody to know that this is what those officers took,” Roxie Washington said during a Minneapolis news conference with her young daughter at her side. “I want justice for him because he was good. No matter what anybody thinks, he was good.” ADVERTISEMENTSkip ................................................................ On Monday, scattered violence flared in multiple protests, including an officer who was shot and gravely wounded outside a Las Vegas hotel and casino, and four officers shot in St. Louis. They were expected to recover. About a dozen other deaths have been reported around the country over the past week. And nearly 8,000 people nationwide have been arrested, according to a count by The Associated Press. Some protesters framed the burgeoning movement as a necessity after a string of killings by police. “It feels like it’s just been an endless cascade of hashtags of black people dying, and it feels like nothing’s really being done by our political leaders to actually enact real change,” said Christine Ohenzuwa, 19, who attended a peaceful protest at the Minnesota state Capitol in St. Paul. “There’s always going to be a breaking point. I think right now, we’re seeing the breaking point around the country.” “I live in this state. It’s really painful to see what’s going on, but it’s also really important to understand that it’s connected to a system of racial violence,” she said. Meanwhile, governors and mayors, Republicans and Democrats alike, rejected Trump’s threat to send in the military, with some saying troops would be unnecessary and others questioning whether the government has such authority and warning that such a step would be dangerous. “Denver is not Little Rock in 1957, and Donald Trump is not President Eisenhower. This is a time for healing, for bringing people together, and the best way to protect civil rights is to move away from escalating violence,” Colorado Gov. Jared Polis and Denver Mayor Michael Hancock, both Democrats, said in a statement, referring to Eisenhower’s use of troops to enforce school desegregation in the South. A senior White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that the president is not rushing to send in the military and that his goal was to pressure governors to deploy more National Guard members. ADVERTISEMENTSkip ................................................................ Such use of the military would mark a stunning federal intervention rarely seen in modern American history. Amid the protests, nine states and the District of Columbia held presidential primaries that tested the nation’s ability to run elections while balancing a pandemic and sweeping social unrest. Joe Biden won hundreds more delegates and was on the cusp of formally securing the Democratic presidential nomination. Also Tuesday, Minnesota opened an investigation into whether the Minneapolis Police Department has a pattern of discrimination against minorities. Floyd died May 25 after a white Minneapolis officer, Derek Chauvin, pressed his knee on the handcuffed black man’s neck for several minutes. Chauvin has been charged with murder.

More protests sweep US cities as Trump decries ‘lowlifes’ WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump on Tuesday turned up the pressure on governors to quell the violence set off by the death of George Floyd, demanding New York call up the National Guard to stop the “lowlifes and losers.” As more demonstrations began taking shape around the country, and cities including Washington prepared for another possible round of scattered violence after dark, the president amplified his hard-line calls of a day earlier, in which he threatened to send in the military to restore order if governors didn’t do it. “NYC, CALL UP THE NATIONAL GUARD,” he tweeted. “The lowlifes and losers are ripping you apart. Act fast!” One day after a crackdown on peaceful protesters near the White House, thousands of demonstrators massed a block away from the presidential mansion, facing law enforcement personnel standing across a black chain-link fence.

(AP) — As demonstrators flooded streets across America to decry the killing of George Floyd, public health experts watched in alarm — the close proximity of protesters and their failures in many cases to wear masks, along with the police using tear gas, could fuel new transmissions of the coronavirus. Many of the protests broke out in places where the virus is still circulating widely in the population. In fact, an Associated Press review found that demonstrations have taken place in every one of the 25 U.S. communities with the highest concentrations of new cases. Some have seen major protests over multiple days, including Minneapolis-St. Paul, Chicago, Washington, D.C., and Los Angeles. The protests have come just as communities across the nation loosen restrictions on businesses and public life that have helped slow the spread of the virus, deepening concern that the two factors taken together could create a national resurgence in cases. “As a nation, we have to be concerned about a rebound,” Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser warned Sunday after days of protests rocked the nation’s capital. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo bemoaned the crowds, saying that hundreds could potentially have been infected, undoing months of social distancing. A fresh outbreak in the places where protesters gathered could lead to reinstituting shutdowns. ___ Thousands remain protesting in NYC streets, defying curfew NEW YORK (AP) — Thousands of demonstrators protesting the death of George Floyd remained on New York City streets on Tuesday after an 8 p.m. curfew put in place by officials struggling to stanch destruction and growing complaints that the nation’s biggest city was reeling out of control night by night. Mayor Bill de Blasio had doubled down on a citywide curfew, moving it up from 11 p.m. the night before, but rejected urging from President Donald Trump and an offer from Gov. Andrew Cuomo to bring in the National Guard. The police department announced it would allow no vehicle traffic south of 96th Street in Manhattan after curfew, though residents, essential workers, buses and truck deliveries were exempt. “We’re going to have a tough few days. We’re going to beat it back,” de Blasio, a Democrat, said in announcing that an 8 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew would remain through Sunday. Protests had resumed Tuesday during the day over the death of Floyd, a black man who died on May 25 after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed a knee on his neck even after he stopped moving and pleading for air. ___ The Latest: Biden wins Maryland’s presidential primary The Latest on Tuesday’s primary elections (all times EDT): 8:55 p.m. Joe Biden has won Maryland’s Democratic presidential primary. Biden was declared the winner of Tuesday’s primary on a night when six other states and the District of Columbia are voting in the presidential nomination contest. The result has been expected because Biden’s rivals have already dropped out of the race. Voters in Maryland were strongly urged to vote by mail because of concerns about further spread of the coronavirus. ___ Tropical Storm Cristobal forms, flood threat for Mexico MEXICO CITY (AP) — Tropical Storm Cristobal formed in the southern Gulf of Mexico on Tuesday, bringing some flooding to Mexico’s southern Gulf coast and threatening more deadly inundations farther inland. Cristobal was the earliest third named storm of an Atlantic hurricane season on record; in 2016, Tropical Storm Colin formed in the Gulf on June 5. The U.S. National Hurricane Center said Cristobal was now expected to dip inland along the Mexican coast near the low-lying, flood-prone city of Ciudad del Carmen and meander there for a couple of days. That could pump a huge amount of water into coastal lagoons behind the city. Police in Campeche state, where Ciudad del Carmen is located, said they have already closed several highways because of flooding. By Friday, the storm is expected to make a northward turn and head towards the U.S. Gulf coast, where the Hurricane Center said “there is a risk of storm surge, rainfall, and wind impacts this weekend along portions of the U.S. Gulf Coast from Texas to the Florida Panhandle.” ___ Curfews give sweeping powers to cops, but are often flouted COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) — Hundreds of cities have imposed curfews to keep the peace during a week of violent unrest across the U.S., employing a tactic that gives law enforcement sweeping arrest powers but is frequently flouted and criticized as being unconstitutional. From New York City to Fargo, North Dakota, cities large and small have put curfews in place — in some cases for the first time in decades — sending out emergency notices on phones and highway signs urging people to stay off the streets. But the deadlines aren’t hard and fast — many of them have exceptions for people heading to and from work, reporters, public transportation and even people buying groceries. Many protesters and citizens have routinely disregarded the restrictions, and police have allowed peaceful demonstrations to continue after curfew while focusing their attention on violent unrest. A curfew allows police the ability without any other reason to threaten to arrest or detain crowds of protesters that linger or groups that appear to be a danger to order. And curfews can be a deterrent to get law-abiding citizens off the street and allow police to focus their efforts on the unrest and not get bogged down in run-of-the-mill violations. New York City put in place a large-scale curfew for what appeared to be the first time in nearly 80 years this week as groups vandalized buildings and stole from stores. The curfew was originally 11 p.m., but Mayor Bill de Blasio rolled it back to 8 p.m., before the sun goes down. ___ Zuckerberg still under fire over inflammatory Trump posts OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) — Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg isn’t budging over his refusal to take action on inflammatory posts by President Donald Trump that spread misinformation about voting by mail and, many said, encouraged violence against protesters. His critics, however, are multiplying. Some employees have publicly quit over the issue and civil-rights leaders who met with him Monday night denounced Zuckerberg’s explanation for choosing to leave Trump’s posts alone as “incomprehensible.” A day after dozens of Facebook employees staged a virtual walkout over the issue, the Facebook chief met Tuesday with employees for a Q&A session held via online video. During that session, which had been moved forward from later in the week, Zuckerberg reportedly doubled down on his stance to leave Trump’s posts alone — although he did suggest that the company was considering changes to its existing policies around “state use of force,” which Trump’s Minneapolis post fell under. Facebook rival Twitter flagged and demoted a Trump tweet in which he referenced protests over police violence in Minneapolis using the phrase “when the looting starts the shooting starts.” But Facebook let an identical message stand on its service. Zuckerberg explained his reasoning in a Facebook post Friday, a position he has since reiterated several times. “I know many people are upset that we’ve left the President’s posts up, but our position is that we should enable as much expression as possible unless it will cause imminent risk of specific harms or dangers spelled out in clear policies,” Zuckerberg wrote. ___ Eagles’ Don Henley asks Congress to change copyright law WASHINGTON (AP) — Eagles songwriter Don Henley urged Congress on Tuesday to “Take It to the Limit” to protect artists against online pirating, wading into a copyright fight pitting Hollywood and the recording industry against big tech platforms like Google’s YouTube. The blockbuster hitmaker of the 1970s testified online from his home before a Senate Judiciary subcommittee weighing possible changes to a 1998 copyright law. The law allows holders of copyrighted material to formally ask parties they believe have taken their content without permission to remove it. The parties can dispute the claim. If they comply promptly with the request, there are no legal consequences. Otherwise, they may be subject to criminal penalties. Henley said the law is weak and needs to be changed to make it more effective in stopping online piracy. The so-called “notice and takedown” system under the copyright law is used by the movie and recording industries, entertainment software makers and book authors to pursue tech platforms, universities and other facilitators of file-sharing. Henley called the copyright law “a relic of a MySpace era in a TikTok world.” With hundreds of millions of takedown notices sent, for every link taken down, “a dozen more pop up in its place,” he said. The system “still allows Big Tech to rake in revenue” after repeated copyright infringements, Henley said. ___ Washington man has some surprise guests: about 60 protesters WASHINGTON (AP) — Rahul Dubey had some unexpected guests Monday night — about 60 in all — as a tense nation’s capital continued to grapple with the fallout from the death of George Floyd while in police custody. They were protesters out after Washington’s 7 p.m. curfew and about to be arrested when Dubey frantically waved them into his rowhouse. Police chased them as far as the entrance. Inside, pandemonium ensued as some of the screaming protesters hit by pepper spray sought relief for their eyes with milk and water. On the back patio, neighbors pitched in by handing milk over the fence. “The whole time he didn’t think of himself,” said one of the protesters, a 22-year-old Virginia man named Meka who declined to give his last name. “He was just trying to keep everybody safe, make sure we knew our rights and to make sure our spirits were lifted throughout the night.” Dubey said a police line was about two houses away when he flung his door open and he encouraged people to come inside. “And now the pepper spray is coming, and they’re coughing and they can’t see and they’re tripping up on the stairs and their friends or whoever’s around them is helping them, pulling them inside the house. And this went on for 10 minutes,” Dubey said, adding that “it was pure terror. It was 10 minutes of terror.”",0.0

PARIS (AP) — Tear gas choked Paris streets as riot police faced off with protesters setting fires Tuesday amid growing global outrage over George Floyd’s death in the United States, racial injustice and heavy-handed police tactics around the world. French protesters took a knee and raised their fists while firefighters struggled to extinguish multiple blazes as a largely peaceful, multiracial demonstration degenerated into scattered tensions. Police said at least 20,000 people joined the demonstration, defying a virus-related ban on protests to pay homage to Floyd and Adama Traore, a French black man who died in police custody. Electric scooters and construction barriers went up in flames, and smoke stained a sign reading “Restaurant Open” — on the first day French cafes were allowed to open after nearly three months of virus lockdown. Chanting “I can’t breathe,” thousands marched peacefully through Australia’s largest city, while thousands more demonstrated in the Dutch capital of The Hague and hundreds rallied in Tel Aviv. Expressions of anger erupted in multiple languages on social networks, with thousands of Swedes joining an online protest and others speaking out under the banner of #BlackOutTuesday. Diplomatic ire percolated too, with the European Union’s top foreign policy official saying the bloc was “shocked and appalled” by Floyd’s death. Floyd died last week after a police officer pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes even after he stopped moving and pleading for air. The death set off protests that spread across America — and now, beyond. As demonstrations escalated worldwide, solidarity with U.S. protesters increasingly mixed with local worries. “This happened in the United States, but it happens in France, it happens everywhere,” Paris protester Xavier Dintimille said. While he said police violence seems worse in the U.S., he added, “all blacks live this to a degree.” Fears of the coronavirus remain close to the surface and were the reason cited for banning Tuesday’s protest at the main Paris courthouse, because gatherings of more than 10 people remain forbidden. But demonstrators showed up anyway. Some said police violence worsened during virus confinement in working class suburbs with large minority populations, deepening a feeling of injustice. As the Paris demonstration wound down, police fired volley after volley of tear gas and protesters threw debris. Police were less visible than usual at the city’s frequent protests. Tensions also erupted at a related protest in the southern city of Marseille. The demonstrations were held in honor of Traore, who died shortly after his arrest in 2016, and in solidarity with Americans demonstrating against Floyd’s death. The Traore case has become emblematic of the fight against police brutality in France. The circumstances of the death of the 24-year-old Frenchman of Malian origin are still under investigation after four years of conflicting medical reports about what happened. The lawyer for two of the three police officers involved in the arrest, Rodolphe Bosselut, said the Floyd and Traore cases “have strictly nothing to do with each other.” Bosselut told The Associated Press that Traore’s death wasn’t linked with the conditions of his arrest but other factors, including a preexisting medical condition. Traore’s family says he died from asphyxiation because of police tactics — and that his last words were “I can’t breathe.” “I can’t breathe” were also the final words of David Dungay, a 26-year-old Aboriginal man who died in a Sydney prison in 2015 while being restrained by five guards. As 3,000 people marched peacefully through Sydney, many said they had been inspired by a mixture of sympathy for African Americans and to call for change in Australia’s treatment of its indigenous population, particularly involving police. The mostly Australian crowd at the authorized demonstration also included protesters from the U.S. and elsewhere. “I’m here for my people, and for our fallen brothers and sisters around the world,” said Sydney indigenous woman Amanda Hill, 46, who attended the rally with her daughter and two nieces. “What’s happening in America shines a light on the situation here.” Even as U.S. President Donald Trump fanned anger by threatening to send in troops on American protesters, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau refrained from directly criticizing him and said the protests should force awareness of racism everywhere. “We all watch in horror and consternation what’s going on in the United States,” he said after pausing 21 seconds before answering. “But it is a time for us as Canadians to recognize that we, too, have our challenges, that black Canadians and racialized Canadians face discrimination as a lived reality every single day. There is systemic discrimination in Canada.” More protests in various countries are planned later in the week, including a string of demonstrations in front of U.S. embassies on Saturday. The drama unfolding in the U.S. drew increasing diplomatic concern. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell’s remarks in Brussels were the strongest to come out of the 27-nation bloc, saying Floyd’s death was a result of an abuse of power. Borrell told reporters that “like the people of the United States, we are shocked and appalled by the death of George Floyd.” He underlined that Europeans “support the right to peaceful protest, and also we condemn violence and racism of any kind, and for sure, we call for a de-escalation of tensions.” German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said peaceful protests in the U.S. following Floyd’s death are “understandable and more than legitimate.” “I can only express my hope that the peaceful protests do not continue to lead to violence, but even more express the hope that these protests have an effect in the United States,” Maas said. More African leaders are speaking up over the killing of Floyd. “It cannot be right that, in the 21st century, the United States, this great bastion of democracy, continues to grapple with the problem of systemic racism,” Ghana President Nana Akufo-Addo said in a statement, adding that black people the world over are shocked and distraught. Kenyan opposition leader and former Prime Minister Raila Odinga offered a prayer for the U.S., “that there be justice and freedom for all human beings who call America their country.” Like some in Africa who have spoken out, Odinga also noted troubles at home, saying the judging of people by character instead of skin color “is a dream we in Africa, too, owe our citizens.” ___ Associated Press writers Rick Rycroft in Sydney, Rod McGuirk in Canberra, Australia, Lori Hinnant in Paris, Aritz Parra in Madrid, Frank Jordans in Berlin, Lorne Cook in Brussels, Peter Dejong in The Hague contributed. ___ Follow AP’s latest news about the protests at https://apnews.com/GeorgeFloyd",0.0

TOKYO (AP) — Asian shares rose Wednesday after Wall Street extended its gains for the third straight day, driven by optimism over economies reopening from shutdowns to stem the coronavirus pandemic. Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 gained 1.1% to 22,581.19 in morning trading. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 rose 0.8% to 5,882.60. South Korea’s Kospi surged 2.6% to 2,141.28. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 gained 1% to 5,894.00. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng was up 1.1% at 24,258.49, while the Shanghai Composite added 0.4% to 2,931.90. “The theme of reopening optimism has its stronghold on markets going into the midweek, one to likewise inspire Asia markets gains despite the series of ongoing concerns,” said Jingyi Pan, market strategist for IG in Singapore. Among such concerns are the future of the two major economies of the world, China and the U.S and whether widespread protests in the U.S. will set off another rise in COVID-19 cases. On Wall Street, the S&P 500 closed 0.8% higher, at 3,080.82, after wavering throughout the morning. Technology, industrial and health care sector stocks accounted for a big slice of the gains. Energy stocks far outpaced the rest of the market as the price of crude rose ahead of a meeting of major oil producers. Bond yields climbed, another sign of ebbing pessimism among investors. So far, Wall Street’s momentum has not been derailed by the wave of daily unrest across the U.S. that began last week in Minneapolis as a protest over police brutality. Cities across the country have been rocked by violence and destruction for seven days in a row, drawing threats from the White House to send troops in to put down the unrest. “The market action seems to have a lot more to do with people’s confidence about the economic reopening,” said Tom Hainlin, national investment strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management. “It’s happening irrespective to what we’re seeing socially across the country right now.” The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.1% to 25,742.65. The Nasdaq composite, which is heavily weighted with technology companies, added 0.6%, to 9,608.37 after dipping as much as 0.8%. Smaller company stocks had some of the biggest gains. The Russell 2000 index picked up 0.9%, to 1,418.21. NASA astronauts launched into space by SpaceX on Saturday rang the opening bell from the International Space Station early Tuesday to kick off trading on the Nasdaq. Stocks have now recouped most of their losses after the initial economic fallout from the coronavirus knocked the market into a staggering 34% skid in February and March. The S&P 500 is now down 9% from its all-time high in February. Investors are hoping that the worst of the recession has already passed, or will soon, as governments around the country and around the world slowly lift the restrictions that left broad swaths of the U.S. economy at a standstill beginning in March. While more countries and sectors are reopening, economic activity is expected to remain subdued as social distancing rules complicate plans to get back to business. Meanwhile, investors continue to keep an eye out for any signs that the reopening of the economy is leading to a resurgence in COVID-19 cases. In Japan, Tokyo reported 34 newly confirmed cases on Tuesday, leading city officials to declare a largely symbolic “alert” for more social distancing. The Rainbow Bridge in Tokyo was lit red to remind residents. Before Tuesday, daily new infections had dropped below 20 recently. Bond yields were mostly higher. The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 0.71% from 0.68% late Tuesday. Benchmark U.S. crude added 76 cents to $37.57 a barrel. It rose $1.37 to $36.81 a barrel on Tuesday. Brent crude oil for August delivery gained 54 cents to $40.11 a barrel. The balance of this week will provide new data on the labor market, which has racked up huge increases in Americans who’ve lost their job as the coronavirus shutdowns left millions out of work. Payroll processor ADP issues its May survey of hiring by private U.S. companies on Wednesday. The weekly tally of applications for unemployment aid comes on Thursday. And on Friday, the government reports its May labor market data. Analysts surveyed by FactSet expect the report will show the economy lost 9 million jobs last month and that the national unemployment rate jumped to nearly 20%. Investors will also have their eye on a couple of companies set to go public this week. Music company Warner Music Group is set to hold its IPO on Wednesday, while business information services company ZoomInfo Technologies is scheduled to go public on Thursday. The U.S. dollar slipped to 108.62 Japanese yen from 108.67 yen late Tuesday. The euro climbed to $1.1200 from $1.1171. ___ AP Business Writer Alex Veiga contributed.",0.0

He said the incident happened around 12:15 a.m. in the parking lot of Dino's Food Mart, located at 26th and Broadway.McAtee owned a restaurant nearby called Yaya's BBQ.Mayor Greg Fischer called McAtee a wonderful citizen, and said many knew him as ""the BBQ man.""Conrad said LMPD and the National Guard were breaking up a large group at that location when someone fired at them. Law enforcement then returned fire, police said. Police said they have several persons of interest being interviewed and it is still unclear who fired the first shot and who struck McAtee.“It’s very clear that many people do not trust the police. That is an issue we’re going to work on and work through,"" Conrad said during an early morning news conference.Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear held a news conference around noon saying to his understanding, there was significant footage of what happened, including from body cameras. He called on all of it to be released quickly.“I’m not asking people to trust our account (of what happened). I want to see the video for ourselves,” Beshear said.It was later learned that none of the LMPD officers present had their cameras activated. Two LMPD officers on the scene who police confirm were involved, Kate Crews and Allen Austin, have been put on administrative leave.The governor said he has heard the crowd at that food mart was not demonstrating at the time, but police responded because they were violating curfew.A curfew went into effect Sunday night at 9 p.m. for the whole city. That curfew has since been extended through June 8.It was an attempt by the mayor to settle unrest that has gone on for several days in the city over the Breonna Taylor case and other cases causing protests and riots across the country.Beshear also had Taylor's mother speak Monday, during which she said, ""We can't get justice with violence.""Seven people were shot the first day of protests in Louisville. The first few days resulted in heavy damage, vandalism and small fires around the city. Beshear is encouraging peaceful protests moving forward.",0.0

(AP Photo/John Locher) WASHINGTON (AP) — Undeterred by curfews, protesters streamed back into the nation’s streets Tuesday, hours after President Donald Trump pressed governors to put down the violence set off by George Floyd’s death and demanded that New York call up the National Guard to stop the “lowlifes and losers.” But most protests passed peacefully, and while there were scattered reports of looting in New York City, the country appeared calmer by late Tuesday than it did a day earlier, when violence swept through multiple cities. The president, meanwhile, amplified his hard-line calls from Monday, when he threatened to send in the military to restore order if governors didn’t do it. “NYC, CALL UP THE NATIONAL GUARD,” he tweeted. “The lowlifes and losers are ripping you apart. Act fast!” One day after a crackdown on peaceful protesters near the White House, thousands of demonstrators massed a block away from the presidential mansion, facing law enforcement personnel standing behind a black chain-link fence. The fence was put up overnight to block access to Lafayette Park, just across the street from the White House. “Last night pushed me way over the edge,” said Jessica DeMaio, 40, of Washington, who attended a Floyd protest Tuesday for the first time. “Being here is better than being at home feeling helpless.” The crowd remained in place after the city’s 7 p.m. curfew passed, defying warnings that the response from law enforcement could be even more forceful. But the protest lacked the tension of the previous nights’ demonstrations. The crowd Tuesday was peaceful, even polite. At one point, the crowd booed when a protester climbed a light post and took down a street sign. A chant went up: “Peaceful protest!” On Monday, law enforcement officers on foot and horseback aggressively drove protesters away from Lafayette Park, clearing the way for President Donald Trump to do a photo op at nearby St. John’s Church. On Tuesday, pastors at the church prayed with demonstrators and handed out water bottles. Protests ranged across the U.S., including in Los Angeles, Miami, St. Paul, Minnesota, Columbia, South Carolina, and Houston, where the police chief talked to peaceful demonstrators, vowing reforms. “God as my witness, change is coming,” Art Acevedo said. “And we’re going to do it the right way.” In New York, midtown Manhattan was pocked with battered storefronts after Monday’s protests. Macy’s flagship store was among those hit when crowds of people smashed windows and looted stores as they swept through the area. Police made nearly 700 arrests and Mayor Bill de Blasio extended an 8 p.m. curfew all week. “We’re going to have a tough few days,” he warned, but added: “We’re going to beat it back.” He pleaded with community leaders to step forward and “create peace.” Thousands of protesters marched Tuesday night in a string of demonstrations across Manhattan and Brooklyn after merchants boarded up their businesses, fearing a repeat of the night before. Many people remained on the streets after the curfew hour. Police eventually ordered them to move along and began taking some into custody. More than 20,000 National Guard members have been called up in 29 states to deal with the violence. New York is not among them, and de Blasio has said he does not want the Guard. On Tuesday, Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo called what happened in the city “a disgrace.” “The NYPD and the mayor did not do their job last night,” Cuomo said at a briefing in Albany. He said the mayor underestimated the problem, and the nation’s largest police force was not deployed in sufficient numbers, though the city had said it doubled the usual police presence. Tuesday marked the eighth straight night of the protests, which began in Minneapolis, where Floyd died, and quickly spread across the country. The mother of George Floyd’s 6-year-old daughter, Gianna, said she wanted the world to know that her little girl lost a good father. “I want everybody to know that this is what those officers took,” Roxie Washington said during a Minneapolis news conference with her young daughter at her side. “I want justice for him because he was good. No matter what anybody thinks, he was good.” On Monday, scattered violence flared in multiple protests, including an officer who was shot and gravely wounded outside a Las Vegas hotel and casino, and four officers shot in St. Louis. They were expected to recover. About a dozen other deaths have been reported around the country over the past week. And nearly 8,000 people nationwide have been arrested, according to a count by The Associated Press. Some protesters framed the burgeoning movement as a necessity after a string of killings by police. “It feels like it’s just been an endless cascade of hashtags of black people dying, and it feels like nothing’s really being done by our political leaders to actually enact real change,” said Christine Ohenzuwa, 19, who attended a peaceful protest at the Minnesota state Capitol in St. Paul. “There’s always going to be a breaking point. I think right now, we’re seeing the breaking point around the country.” “I live in this state. It’s really painful to see what’s going on, but it’s also really important to understand that it’s connected to a system of racial violence,” she said. Meanwhile, governors and mayors, Republicans and Democrats alike, rejected Trump’s threat to send in the military, with some saying troops would be unnecessary and others questioning whether the government has such authority and warning that such a step would be dangerous. “Denver is not Little Rock in 1957, and Donald Trump is not President Eisenhower. This is a time for healing, for bringing people together, and the best way to protect civil rights is to move away from escalating violence,” Colorado Gov. Jared Polis and Denver Mayor Michael Hancock, both Democrats, said in a statement, referring to Eisenhower’s use of troops to enforce school desegregation in the South. A senior White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that the president is not rushing to send in the military and that his goal was to pressure governors to deploy more National Guard members. Such use of the military would mark a stunning federal intervention rarely seen in modern American history. Amid the protests, nine states and the District of Columbia held presidential primaries that tested the nation’s ability to run elections while balancing a pandemic and sweeping social unrest. Joe Biden won hundreds more delegates and was on the cusp of formally securing the Democratic presidential nomination. Also Tuesday, Minnesota opened an investigation into whether the Minneapolis Police Department has a pattern of discrimination against minorities. Floyd died May 25 after a white Minneapolis officer, Derek Chauvin, pressed his knee on the handcuffed black man’s neck for several minutes. Chauvin has been charged with murder. Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said prosecutors are working as fast as they can to determine if the three other officers at the scene should be charged too. All four have been fired. ___ Sullivan reported from Minneapolis. Associated Press journalists across the U.S. contributed to this report.",0.0

Breonna Taylor, a black woman, was fatally shot by police in her home in March. (AP Photo/Darron Cummings) One man was a retired St. Louis police captain checking on his friend’s shop. Another was the beloved owner of a Louisville barbecue restaurant who provided free meals to officers. Yet another was a man known as “Mr. Indianapolis,” a former star football player. They are among those killed as protests have roiled American cities in the week since the death of George Floyd, a black man who pleaded for air as a white Minneapolis officer jammed a knee into his neck. The deaths, as well as widespread peaceful protests, have at times been overshadowed by the shocking images of heavy-handed police tactics, vandalism and arson. Dozens have been injured in the chaos. Many of the people killed were African Americans, compounding the tragedy for black communities. The death toll and circumstances of the killings are still being sorted out in many cities, but here is what we know so far: ST. LOUIS A 77-year-old retired St. Louis police captainwho served 38 years on the force was shot and killed by looters at a pawn shop early Tuesday, authorities said. David Dorn was found dead on the sidewalk in front of the ransacked store. Police have not released details about what led to the shooting, and no one has been arrested. The shooting apparently was streamed on Facebook Live but has been taken down. It came on a violent night in St. Louis, which saw four officers shot, businesses burned and ransacked, and people pelting officers with rocks hours following a peaceful protest. Dorn was a friend of the pawn shop’s owner and frequently checked on the business when alarms went off, wife Ann Marie Dorn told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. David Dorn’s personality was “bigger than life,” said former St. Louis County police Chief Tim Fitch. “He was a fun guy, a happy guy.” Dorn retired in October 2007 and then became police chief of Moline Acres, a small town north of St. Louis. ___ LOUISVILLE Police and the National Guard troops trying to clear a crowd Monday heard gunshots and returned fire, killing David McAtee, the owner of a barbecue restaurant. The mayor fired the police chief after finding out officers did not turn on their body-worn cameras. State police and the U.S. attorney also are investigating. McAtee was a 53-year-old African American man known for offering free meals to officers who stopped by his restaurant. “We lost a wonderful citizen,” Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer said. “David was a friend to many, a well-known barbecue man.” Acting police Chief Robert Schroeder said Tuesday that video from security cameras at McAtee’s business and an adjoining store showed McAtee firing a gunas officers approached. “This video does not provide all the answers. But we are releasing it to provide transparency. It does not answer every question, including why did he fire and where were police at the time he fired,” Schroeder said. The protests also have centered on the death of Breonna Taylor, a black woman killed in her Louisville home in March as narcotics detectives serving a search warrant knocked down her door. No drugs were found. ___ OAKLAND, CALIFORNIA A federal officer was providing security at a U.S. courthouse during a protest when someone fired shots from a vehicle. Dave Patrick Underwood, 53, died and another officer was critically wounded. It wasn’t immediately clear if the drive-by shooting was related to the protests, though the federal building’s glass doors were smashed and the front entrance was sprayed with anti-police graffiti. No one has been arrested. Underwood, who was black, and the other officer were contracted security officers employed by the Department of Homeland Security’s Federal Protective Service. They were monitoring a nearby protest. Underwood was the brother of Angela Underwood Jacobs, recently a Republican candidate to fill a vacant congressional seat north of Los Angeles. ___ INDIANAPOLIS Two people were killed this past weekend amid unrest, including 38-year-old Chris Beaty, a former offensive lineman for Indiana University. Beaty was known as “Mr. Indianapolis” and remained involved with the Hoosiers long after graduation. He also was a prominent businessman, running multiple nightclubs. “I am at a loss for words. The news of the passing of Chris Beaty is just devastating,” coach Tom Allen said in a statement. “Since I returned home to coach at Indiana, Chris embraced me, encouraged me and supported me! His passion for life and Indiana Football energized me every time we were together.” The circumstances of Beaty’s shooting weren’t immediately clear, but some media reports said it happened near his apartment. It came the same night an 18-year-old man was fatally shot as protests erupted in the city. ___ DAVENPORT, IOWA Police are investigating the deaths of 22-year-old Italia Kelly, who was shot Monday while leaving a protest outside a Walmart, and of a man found near where suspects exchanged gunfire with police in the city of 100,000 people across the Mississippi River from Illinois. Kelly and a friend were getting in a vehicle to leave because a protest had turned unruly when she was struck in the back by a bullet, said her aunt, Amy Hale of Atchison, Kansas. No arrests have been made. “She was always smiling, always laughing. That’s why it’s so sad that she was taken in such a violent way,” Hale said. “That is not Italia. She was the bright, bubbly big personality in the room.” Separately, authorities said an officer was “ambushed” with gunfire Sunday. Another officer shot back, and the suspects fled but were arrested. Near where the officer was wounded, police found a man shot to death and a handgun under his body. His identity wasn’t released. Police said surveillance video shows that the man and some of the arrested suspects were involved in a shooting outside a jewelry store hours earlier. They were casing the business when other cars arrived and multiple people fired shots at each other, police said. ___ MINNEAPOLIS In what is believed to be the first killing since the protests broke out, Calvin L. Horton Jr. was fatally shot outside a pawn shop last week. The owner of the pawn shop, who is white, was arrested in the death of Horton, a 43-year-old black man. Police say they are investigating the circumstances of the killing, including whether it was related to protests in the neighborhood. The shop was described as having been significantly damaged during the unrest. ___ OMAHA, NEBRASKA James Scurlock, a 22-year-old black man, was killed Saturday after authorities said he tussled with the owner of two downtown bars. Surveillance video of the strip of bars shows a group of people, including Scurlock, approach white bar owner Jake Gardner. Two people shove Gardner to the ground, and he fired shots in the air. Seconds later, Scurlock is seen jumping on Gardner, who then fires the gun over his shoulder, striking Scurlock. Authorities have declined to press charges in the death, calling the shooting self-defense. But Gardner could still face misdemeanor gun charges because his concealed carry permit for the gun had expired, the police chief said. ___ DETROIT A 21-year-old man was killed in downtown Detroit after someone fired shots into a vehicle during a protest. According to a police report, the man was sitting in the driver’s seat of a car in a parking lot with two others when someone opened fire and then ran away. ___ SUBURBAN CHICAGO Two people were killed during unrest Monday in the suburb of Cicero, according to a town official. Spokesman Ray Hanania did not provide details about those who were killed but said it happened during protests. ___ Associated Press journalists around the country contributed to this report.",0.0

In recent years, former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick was the face of the movement. In 2016, he began kneeling before games, during the playing of the national anthem, to protest police treatment of minorities and social inequality. Since last week's death of George Floyd, an African American man who died after a Minneapolis police officer kneeled on his neck, there's been a surge of sports figures speaking out. Some have even joined demonstrations that have swept the nation. True to its status as the most politically progressive of this country's major sports, the NBA has had many players and officials lend their voices – from Commissioner Adam Silver to Los Angeles Lakers star LeBron James to legendary Lakers center and longtime political activist Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, who wrote about what he believes is the motivation behind the widespread protests. ""The black community is used to the institutional racism inherent in education, the justice system and jobs,"" Abdul-Jabbar said in a Los Angeles Times essay last weekend. ""And even though we do all the conventional things to raise public and political awareness ... the needle hardly budges."" He added, ""Yes, protests often are used as an excuse for some to take advantage, just as when fans celebrating a hometown sports team championship burn cars and destroy storefronts. I don't want to see stores looted or even buildings burn. But African Americans have been living in a burning building for many years, choking on the smoke as the flames burn closer and closer. Racism in America is like dust in the air. It seems invisible — even if you're choking on it — until you let the sun in."" Even Michael Jordan weighed in publicly, which to many was a surprise. The recent 10-part ESPN documentary, The Last Dance, lionized the legendary Chicago Bulls star, although it touched on a few perceived shortcomings, including what some see as Jordan's unwillingness to speak out on political issues. ""I do commend Muhammad Ali for standing up for what he believed in,"" Jordan said in the documentary, adding, ""but I never thought of myself as an activist. I thought of myself as a basketball player. ""I wasn't a politician when I was playing my sport. I was focused on my craft. Was that selfish? Probably. But that was my energy. That's where my energy was."" But now Jordan is speaking out, an indication of how deeply Floyd's death has resonated. ""I am deeply saddened, truly pained and plain angry,"" Jordan said in a statement posted on Twitter. ""I see and feel everyone's pain, outrage and frustration. I stand with those who are calling out the ingrained racism and violence toward people of color in our country. We have had enough."" There have been other heartfelt, and perhaps surprising, shows of solidarity. Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Carson Wentz also has been largely apolitical in his four years in the NFL. But last week, Wentz was one of the first prominent white athletes to speak out. ""Being from North Dakota, I've spent a large part of my life surrounded by people of similar color, so I'm never gonna act like I know what the black community goes through or even has gone through,"" Wentz said on Twitter. ""I'll never know the feeling of having to worry about my kids going outside because of their skin color. ... ""I don't understand the society we live in that doesn't value all human life. It's heartbreaking and disturbing. My prayers go out to every man, woman and child that has to endure the effects of the racism in our society."" Former and current African American teammates praised Wentz. ""You didn't have to say a thing but you did,"" former Eagles receiver Torrey Smith tweeted, adding, ""Love you bro."" Traditionally, Major League Baseball has, as a sport, avoided politics. Not now. A number of big leaguers have weighed in, including Washington Nationals relief pitcher Sean Doolittle. He's white, and he offered historical context in a tweet with the hashtag #BlackLivesMatter. ""Racism is America's Original Sin,"" Doolittle wrote. ""It was here before we even forged a nation, and has been passed down from generation to generation. And we still struggle to acknowledge that it even exists, much less atone for it. The generational trauma of racism and violence is killing black men and women before our eyes. ... ""We must not look away from the racism and violence. ... We must take action and call it out for what it is. We must recognize our shared humanity and atone for our Original Sin, or else we will continue to curse future generations with it. ""RIP George Floyd."" Still silence Even though the current environment seems to encourage sports figures to speak out, there's also notable silence coming from the sports world. So says LeVelle Moton. Moton is the men's basketball head coach at North Carolina Central University. He said white basketball and football coaches from the most prominent college conferences in the nation — the Power Five — are not speaking up. And he said he believes they should be. In fact, he said, they're obligated to do so. ""The reality is, a lot of these coaches have been able to create generational wealth,"" Moton told ESPN Radio. ""Their grandkids' kids are gonna be able to live a prosperous life because athletes who were the complexion of George Floyd were able to run a football, throw a football, shoot a basketball or whatever have you, so they have benefited greatly from athletes that look like George Floyd and many more. But whenever people the complexion of George Floyd are killed, assassinated, murdered in the street in broad daylight, they're silent."" Not all. Prominent white college basketball coaches have spoken out against Floyd's death, including the University of Kentucky's John Calipari, Roy Williams of the University of North Carolina and Michigan State University head coach Tom Izzo. Nick Saban is the most famous active head coach in Division 1 college football. He also released a statement about Floyd. ""We're at an important moment for our country,"" the University of Alabama coach said in a message that cited civil rights icons Rosa Parks and the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., ""and now is the time for us to choose kindness, tolerance, understanding, empathy, and most importantly ... it's time to love each other. Every life is precious, and we must understand we have so many more things that unite us than divide us."" Still, the complexity of Kaepernick Sunday's Houston Chronicle sports section went beyond the myriad athlete and coach statements of grief and resolve. It took a strong stand with a full-page editorial statement. The page had a picture of Floyd at the top and a kneeling Kaepernick at the bottom. In between, a section read, ""Imagine, if we had embraced Colin Kaepernick's peaceful protest and paid attention to the issue he was trying to address."" It wasn't the only connector between Floyd and Kaepernick. A dramatic meme circulating since Floyd's death shows a picture of the Minneapolis police officer kneeling on Floyd's neck, next to a picture of Kaepernick kneeling in protest. The visuals have stirred up the not-too-distant memory of Kaepernick's protest, which began in 2016, and was politicized from the beginning. And it's prompting harsh criticism of the NFL, even as the league joins the massive sports outpouring of grief and anger. Last weekend, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell released a statement offering condolences to Floyd's family as well as those of Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor, young African Americans also killed in recent high-profile cases. ""These tragedies inform the NFL's commitment and our ongoing efforts,"" Goodell said, adding, ""There remains an urgent need for action. We recognize the power of our platform in communities and as part of the fabric of American society. We embrace that responsibility and are committed to continuing the important work to address these systemic issues together with our players, clubs and partners."" Critics blasted Goodell for what they called hypocrisy. ""Colin Kaepernick asked the NFL to care about the lives of black people and they banned him from their platform,"" said Michael-Shawn Dugar, an NFL writer for The Athletic. Instead of prompting a discussion about police treatment of minorities and social inequality, Kaepernick's protests prompted a debate about patriotism and the flag, fueled by President Trump, who used an expletive to describe Kaepernick and other players who joined the pregame protests. Even though the NFL ultimately endorsed social justice initiatives, Kaepernick still is considered a pariah — no NFL owner has hired him. And with the league dealing with a significant lack of diversity in important head coaching and general manager positions, Goodell's critics said his reference to the league's ""commitment and our ongoing efforts"" is insincere. On their face, Goodell's words seemed in lockstep with much of the rest of the sports world as it grapples with and grieves over Floyd's death. But for many, the renewed attention on Kaepernick and his experience present just as powerful a message about the powerful NFL, where, in the volatile realm of race and justice, words appear louder than actions.

But several states and the District of Columbia have primaries up and down the ballot: Indiana, Iowa, Maryland, Montana, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and South Dakota. Pennsylvania is holding primary voting on Tuesday, though Gov. Tom Wolf extended the deadline for voting by mail by one week, until June 9. Here are the races to watch. Live results will appear Tuesday evening. Presidential primaries press on. Former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee, has not yet officially clinched the nomination. He went into the day 425 delegates short of the magic number of 1,991. With 500 delegates at stake Tuesday, he needs 85% of the delegates up for grabs, which he's unlikely to get. More likely, Biden will cross the threshold next week, June 9, when Georgia and West Virginia vote, with their 133 delegates at stake (and when we'll get the results of Pennsylvania's primary, with its 186 delegates). Rep. Steve King on the ropes. The controversial Iowa conservative faces real danger in his primary for reelection from Iowa's 4th Congressional District. After racist and pro-white nationalist remarks, much of the Republican establishment abandoned King. They've come for him before in his almost 20 years in Congress unsuccessfully. But this has been their best chance so far. King has trailed in the polls, with only $30,000 cash on hand and no TV ads running. The favorite among his challengers has been state Sen. Randy Feenstra, who has painted King as ineffective in the House, given that he was stripped of key committee assignments. But King is well known as a familiar choice for conservatives in western Iowa and has been resilient. Polls close at 10 p.m. ET Loading... In Iowa's 2nd Congressional District, Democratic Rep. Dave Loebsack is retiring, opening up his seat. Former state Sen. Rita Hart will be the Democratic nominee and will face either state Sen. Mariannette Miller-Meeks or ex-Illinois Congressman Bobby Schilling, who moved to Iowa in 2017. Miller-Meeks got the backing of Gov. Kim Reynolds and Sen. Joni Ernst, as well as House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. Former Sen. Rick Santorum and Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, a top Trump ally, have backed Schilling. Polls close at 10 p.m. ET Loading... Steny Hoyer faces a challenge from the left. A veteran lawmaker from Maryland's 5th Congressional District and No. 2 in House Democratic leadership, Hoyer faces a progressive primary challenge from 29-year-old Mckayla Wilkes. Wilkes, a single mother, was inspired by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's victory in New York in 2018 over another veteran white male Democratic leader. Wilkes raised $300,000 and said Hoyer, who has been in Congress almost 40 years, is out of touch with the district. The Democratic establishment has remained behind Hoyer, though, including the Congressional Black Caucus, which endorsed him. He has outspent Wilkes $2.7 million to $237,000. Polls close at 8 p.m. ET Loading... Spy games in New Mexico. The announced retirement of New Mexico Sen. Tom Udall set off a domino effect. Democratic Rep. Ben Ray Luján declared for Udall's Senate seat, leaving open his seat in the 3rd Congressional District. Enter: Valerie Plame, the ex-CIA agent. She has raised and spent more than any candidate in this race and gained national attention with her glossy campaign ad showing her racing backward in a Chevy Camaro on a dusty road. But locally, her candidacy has looked less like an easy Sunday drive. She faced criticism for being a relative newcomer, moving to the area in 2007; the district is 41% Latino and 19% Native American, and another candidate, Teresa Leger Fernandez, got the endorsements of the political arm of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and EMILY's List. Polls close at 9 p.m. ET Loading... It is very possible that New Mexico sends an all-female House delegation to Congress in 2021, as freshman Democrats Deb Haaland and Xochitl Torres Small are the incumbents in the state's other two districts. But Torres Small has to win what's expected to be a tough reelection race in the 2nd District. Trump won there by 10 points in 2016, and the primary to decide who will take on Torres Small this fall is a contest between two Republican women. It has been a nasty primary between Yvette Herrell, the 2018 nominee, and Claire Chase, an oil executive. Both have campaigned on who's the most pro-Trump; Herrell got the backing of the House Freedom Caucus, but Chase has outraised and outspent Herrell, with support from Defending Main Street, a group with ties to establishment Republicans. Polls close at 9 p.m. ET Loading... Senate matchups to be set in Iowa and Montana. Democrats are hoping to take back the Senate this fall. They have an outside shot at that right now, but their odds have looked increasingly better of late. Partially, that's because of these two races. In Iowa, Democrats are targeting incumbent Republican Joni Ernst, but first there's the primary Tuesday. The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee has backed real estate executive Theresa Greenfield in the four-way contest. Greenfield raised $7.1 million and went into Tuesday as the favorite. Other Democrats include retired Adm. Mike Franken, attorney Kimberly Graham and Eddie Mauro, a businessman and former teacher and coach who has spent the second most — $1.4 million — on this primary. Polls close at 10 p.m. ET Loading... When Montana Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock changed his mind and decided to challenge incumbent Republican Sen. Steve Daines, it suddenly put this race on the map for Democrats in a big way. Three other Democrats are on the ballot Tuesday, but Bullock has been expected to win easily, raising more than 10 times what his next opponent has. Polls close at 10 p.m. ET Loading... Indiana openings. The retirements of moderate Democrat Pete Visclosky in Indiana's 1st District and Republican Susan Brooks, one of only 13 Republican women in Congress, in the 5th District has opened up both of these ideologically divergent seats. More than half a dozen Democrats are competing in the 1st District, which is suburban and exurban Chicago, a place that went for Hillary Clinton with 54% of the vote in 2016. Polls close at 7 p.m. ET Loading... In the 5th District, a handful of Republicans have duked it out, including state Sen. Victoria Spartz, who raised and spent the most and got the backing of the Club for Growth, and Beth Henderson, a local businesswoman with the endorsement of Indiana Sen. Mike Braun. Democrats have rallied around one candidate, Christina Hale. This district has been in GOP hands for a long time, but it could be one to watch this fall. The Cook Political Report lists it as only ""lean Republican."" Trump won it with 53% in 2016.

1623205687,2020-06-02 06:08:00,What We're Reading About The Past Week Of Protests,https://www.krwg.org/post/what-were-reading-about-past-week-protests,en,False,"blacks, police, news and news media, demonstrations and riots, murders and attempted murders, police brutality and misconduct",214420,krwg.org,http://krwg.org/,"If you've been trying to keep up with news about the nationwide protests against police brutality, the stream of stories can be overwhelming. In the days following George Floyd's death in Minneapolis police custody, reporters have been covering the protests in more than 140 cities across the country, trying to make sense of this tumultuous moment. Here are some of the most illuminating stories that we've read this week to help us understand how we got here, and the larger issues driving the protests. Minneapolis in context This is hardly the first time that Minneapolis has erupted into protests about police brutality and the killings of black people. In 2016, people took to the streets after police shot and killed Philando Castile during a traffic stop in a nearby suburb, Falcon Heights. And in 2015, Minneapolis police shot and killed Jamar Clark, which ignited two weeks of protests. In the Boston Review, Elizabeth Hinton relates the current protests in Minneapolis to the ones that followed the deaths of Clark and Castile. She also looks at the nationwide unrest that followed the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968. Similar to the uprisings that took place more than half a century ago, she writes, Minneapolis residents are fed up with the ""buildup of unanswered grievances and the lack of concrete changes to their immediate living conditions."" ""Rather than responding to violent political rebellion with policy—such as addressing mass unemployment, failing public schools, and inhumane housing conditions—policymakers and officials, from Richard Nixon's War on Crime to the bipartisan War on Drugs to Donald Trump's embrace of 'Law and Order' politics, have consistently sought to manage the material consequences of socioeconomic problems (e.g., urban decay and drug abuse) with more police, more surveillance, and, eventually, more incarceration. We as a nation still fail to reckon with the wisdom King prophetically offered toward the end of his life: that only 'social justice and progress are the absolute guarantors of riot prevention. There is no other answer. Constructive social change will bring certain tranquility; evasions will merely encourage turmoil.' "" Policing Over at Slate, Joel Anderson writes that while many police chiefs are condemning the excessive use of force by the police officer who killed Floyd, it's important to pay attention to what police are doing during protests: ""The initial response of police leaders may have felt like progress, but video footage of police and protesters clashing in the streets reveals the truth: Officers are much closer to what we see in viral videos documenting their brutality than in the well-intentioned words of their leaders. Despite the shift in public statements, police haven't changed since the protests of 2014 and 2015."" Many protesters, including journalists, have captured police on tape pointing guns, shooting rubber bullets and tear gas at them. Matthew Dessem compiled a list at Slate of the ways police incited violence: ""Police all over the country tear-gassed protesters, drove vehicles through crowds, opened fire with nonlethal rounds on journalists or people on their own property, and in at least one instance, pushed over an elderly man who was walking away with a cane."" Existing while black The COVID-19 pandemic is still raging during the protests, and as we've reported, black people are dying from the virus at disproportionate rates. And as Annalisa Merelli at Quartz writes, police brutality is also a public health crisis that affects black people at a much higher rate than others: ""To give a sense of the magnitude of the crisis, the APHA reported that in 2016 alone (the latest year for which the organization could get reliable data, in itself a telling sign of the lack of priority accorded to the issue) at least 1,019 people were killed due to police intervention, and 76,440 were injured. This resulted in nearly 55,000 years of life lost, and had a large price tag, too: Police brutality costs $1.8 billion per year, according to the Centers for Disease Control's most recently available data (2010)."" Many argue that these two crises for the black community — police brutality and the coronavirus — aren't independent of each other. In fact, in both cases, the extent of the death toll stems from systemic discrimination, and in both cases, the solution may require a deep rethinking of the overall system. In The Atlantic, Ibram X. Kendi examines an 1896 document by a statistician that says black people were naturally selected for disease and death, and would gradually become extinct. Kendi goes on to write that ""too many Americans have been waiting for black extinction since Hoffman,"" and that black Americans are ""living in a nightmare"" rather than the elusive American dream: ""A nightmare is essentially a horror story of danger, but it is not wholly a horror story. Black people experience joy, love, peace, safety. But as in any horror story, those unforgettable moments of toil, terror, and trauma have made danger essential to the black experience in racist America. What one black American experiences, many black Americans experience. Black Americans are constantly stepping into the toil and terror and trauma of other black Americans. Black Americans are constantly stepping into the souls of the dead. Because they know: They could have been them; they are them. Because they know it is dangerous to be black in America, because racist Americans see blacks as dangerous."" Stories of solidarity Our NPR colleague Leila Fadel wrote about a Somali immigrant, Safia Munye, who opened a restaurant in Minneapolis more than two years ago — only to close her doors because of the coronavirus pandemic. However, the community rallied behind her business and raised more than $180,000 to reopen this weekend — that is, until it was burned down during the protests. But despite her loss, Munye says she wants justice for Floyd and change for Minneapolis. "" 'My heart is broken. My mind is broken,' she says. 'I know I can't come back from this. But this can be replaced. George's life cannot. George's life was more important. That man that got killed in the most inhumane way. I hope he gets justice.' "" And The New York Times brought us another story about resilience and solidarity, about a Bangladeshi family in Minneapolis who also lost their restaurant after it was burned down during one of the protests. Yet they support the uprising, and even opened the restaurant's doors as a medical haven for protesters. "" 'We were just trying to do what we could to help our community,' said [Hafsa] Islam, who helped treat wounded protesters. 'Sure, we had our business. Sure, we were trying to keep our kitchen open. But more than anything, we were concerned for our people.' ""The tension in [Ruhel] Islam's adopted city reminds him of his childhood in Bangladesh, when he lived through a dictatorship. Two of his fellow students were killed by the police, he said. 'We grew up in a traumatic police state, so I am familiar with this type of situation,' he said.""

Many cities imposed curfews, and President Trump again warned he would order active duty military forces to restore order if state and local governments, in his judgement, failed to do so. Here are details of some protests around the country. St. Louis Four police officers were shot and wounded during another night of unrest in St. Louis, according to the city's police chief, John Hayden. In an emotional news conference, Hayden said the officers were hurt in an incident downtown following a day of peaceful protests that drew thousands into the city's streets. He said a couple hundred people ""with no intention of protesting or doing anything constructive"" remained late into the night, looting, vandalizing and throwing objects at police officers. Just after midnight, shots were fired at a line of officers, striking two in the leg, one in the foot and another in the arm, he said. Hayden said none of the injuries were life-threatening. Hayden called Floyd's death tragic but said what was happening in St. Louis was ""mayhem."" ""They're throwing fireworks on officers, fireworks were exploding on officers,"" he said. ""They had officers that had gas poured on them. And you try to figure out what is going on. How can this be?"" Las Vegas There were a pair of shootings overnight in Las Vegas, one of which left a police officer hospitalized and ""in grave condition,"" according to Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Sheriff Joseph Lombardo. The first incident took place in front of the famed Circus Circus Hotel and Casino as police said they were working to disperse protesters. Lombardo said rocks and bottles were being hurled at police. ""Officers were attempting to get some of the protesters in custody when a shot rang out and our officer went down,"" he said during an early Tuesday morning press briefing. The unnamed officer was transported to a local hospital and is in critical condition, he said. A suspect is in custody. The other incident took place shortly before midnight on Monday, when LVMPD and federal officers were guarding the Foley Federal Building and U.S. courthouse. Lombardo said police encountered a man ""who was armed with multiple firearms and appeared to be wearing body armor."" Then, ""officers engaged him"" and ""the suspect was struck by gunfire,"" Lombardo said. He was later pronounced dead. It is unclear if the man was taking part in the protests prior to his deadly encounter with police. Investigations into both incidents are ongoing. ""With these protests, which are leading to riots, one tragedy is only leading to another,"" Lombardo said. ""What has occurred is utterly unacceptable. I hope the community sees it that way too."" Omaha, Neb. Protesters gathered in downtown Omaha on Monday for the third consecutive night after Douglas County Attorney Donald Kleine ruled that a white bar owner who shot and killed a 22-year-old black Omaha protester on Saturday acted in self-defense. Protesters carried signs with slogans such as ""Hands up — don't shoot"" and chanted ""Black lives matter,"" according to Megan Feeney, a freelance journalist reporting for NPR member station NET in Omaha. ""A lot of black leaders were saying, 'Don't go downtown tonight, we need to reconsider our approach, think about how we can reorganize and want to avoid any useless violence, pain and potential death,' "" Feeney said. After the start of an 8 p.m. curfew, the protest had shrunk considerably, according to Feeney, and military vehicles blocked streets adjacent to the demonstration. ""Police started to advance and people started running. They ran down an alley, got blocked and some in the crowd started to throw water bottles and other objects while others yelled to stop,"" Feeney said. ""Officers started closing in from all four directions and nobody could leave."" The Omaha Police Department reported two firearms arrests as well as an unspecified number of arrests for curfew violations. New York New York City imposed an 11 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew Monday. Mayor Bill de Blasio announced the curfew would begin Tuesday at 8 p.m. Protests were largely peaceful, though some looting was reported at a few luxury retailers, including Macy's flagship store in Manhattan. In Buffalo, a city police officer and New York state trooper were struck by an SUV during a protest. The law enforcement officers were not seriously injured. It was unclear whether the driver intentionally struck the officers. ~~~~~https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Freecereports%2Fstatus%2F1267629669093978117https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2FAliWatkins%2Fstatus%2F1267654230183227393https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fnyspolice%2Fstatus%2F1267655485278339072~~~~~~ Los Angeles In Los Angeles, where some 700 people were arrested on Sunday, there was a heavy police presence in Hollywood and Van Nuys amid multiple protests, mostly peaceful.

San Francisco Bay Area Some 15,000 people marched peacefully in downtown Oakland, according to a police spokesperson quoted in the East Bay Times. Most dispersed prior to the start of the city's 8 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew. More than 40 people were arrested for violating the curfew, according to the Oakland Police Department. The Alameda County Sheriff's office tweeted late Monday, ""Over 100 people arrested so far. It is time to go home."" In nearby Walnut Creek, several hundred protesters, mostly teenagers and young people, walked onto Interstate 680, according to the East Bay Times. Police in riot gear ordered them to disperse before chasing them with dogs, firing tear gas and rubber bullets, the newspaper said.

Smith is training in Austin as he attends the University of Texas. His family was originally from Bermuda but he moved to the U.S. as a child and has dual citizenship. “You know, I’m 35 and I can recall all these names of all these people who have passed away — Sandra Bland, Tamir Rice, Trayvon Martin — and they’re just ingrained in my brain and I felt like this was a moment that I really wanted to participate in,” Smith said.

(AP Photo/Keith Srakocic) Voters are being asked to navigate curfews, health concerns and a sharp increase in mail balloting on Tuesday as elections take place from Maryland to Montana. Four states were originally scheduled to vote in April but delayed their contests because of the coronavirus outbreak. Pennsylvania offers the day’s biggest trove of delegates and represents a high-profile test case for Republicans and Democrats working to strengthen their operations in one of the most important general election battlegrounds. “We think we’re prepared,” Pennsylvania Democratic Party Chairwoman Nancy Patton Mills said. “Thank goodness we have the opportunity of working this out in the primary because we don’t know where we’ll be with the pandemic in November.” Joe Biden needs to win 89% of all delegates at stake on Tuesday to formally clinch the nomination, but his role as his party’s clear presidential nominee is not in danger should he fall short. With a dominant showing on Super Tuesday in early March, the former vice president pushed out all his major opponents. He will almost certainly secure the needed delegates later in the month if necessary. Still, Tuesday offers a historic opportunity for the 77-year-old Democrat, who is waging his third presidential campaign and who hopes to amass as many delegates as possible to show strength before going up against President Donald Trump. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is not actively campaigning, having suspended his operation and endorsed Biden, but his name will appear on the ballots. On the eve of Tuesday’s primaries, senior adviser Jeff Weaver encouraged progressives to vote for Sanders anyway. “People who support Bernie Sanders and his agenda, who want to maximize the influence of progressives at the convention, should cast their vote for Bernie Sanders,” Weaver said, reminding voters that the Vermont senator is seeking leverage to shape the party’s platform and rules. The comments serve as a reminder that Biden may have no legitimate Democratic rivals remaining but must still win over skeptical activists from his party’s far-left flank, who worry he’s too close to the political establishment. Party unity will likely be an afterthought this week, however, as more immediate health and safety concerns dominate the national conversation. The coronavirus death toll has surged past 100,000 nationwide, and thousands of new cases are reported each day. At the same time, several major cities, including some voting Tuesday, are grappling with protests following the killing of George Floyd, a handcuffed black man who died after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck for several minutes. Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser ordered a 7 p.m. curfew, though voting places will be open until 8 p.m. Voting has been deemed essential, and city officials say voters will not be subject to arrest if they cast ballots during the curfew. It’s much the same in Philadelphia, where officials have promised that voters would not be arrested should their city’s 6 p.m. curfew be extended for a fourth consecutive night. “We are in unique times, and voting is a unique challenge for people,” said Josh Schwerin, chief strategist for the pro-Democrat super PAC Priorities USA. He said that his organization and others will be watching closely on Tuesday “to see how well it works, where issues are and where obstacles have been put in place.” Political groups have had to adjust as some states move to a system that relies largely on voting by mail. They include Montana, where all 56 counties decided to vote entirely by mail. Voting rights watchdogs in multiple states have expressed concerns about access to mail ballots, confusion about deadlines and a shortage of poll workers that could lead to long lines. Those voting Tuesday are the District of Columbia, Indiana, Maryland, Montana, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and South Dakota.

Smith is training in Austin as he attends the University of Texas. His family was originally from Bermuda but he moved to the U.S. as a child and has dual citizenship. “You know, I’m 35 and I can recall all these names of all these people who have passed away — Sandra Bland, Tamir Rice, Trayvon Martin — and they’re just ingrained in my brain and I felt like this was a moment that I really wanted to participate in,” Smith said.

In recent years, former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick was the face of the movement. In 2016, he began kneeling before games, during the playing of the national anthem, to protest police treatment of minorities and social inequality. Since last week's death of George Floyd, an African American man who died after a Minneapolis police officer kneeled on his neck, there's been a surge of sports figures speaking out. Some have even joined demonstrations that have swept the nation. True to its status as the most politically progressive of this country's major sports, the NBA has had many players and officials lend their voices – from Commissioner Adam Silver to Los Angeles Lakers star LeBron James to legendary Lakers center and longtime political activist Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, who wrote about what he believes is the motivation behind the widespread protests. ""The black community is used to the institutional racism inherent in education, the justice system and jobs,"" Abdul-Jabbar said in a Los Angeles Times essay last weekend. ""And even though we do all the conventional things to raise public and political awareness ... the needle hardly budges."" He added, ""Yes, protests often are used as an excuse for some to take advantage, just as when fans celebrating a hometown sports team championship burn cars and destroy storefronts. I don't want to see stores looted or even buildings burn. But African Americans have been living in a burning building for many years, choking on the smoke as the flames burn closer and closer. Racism in America is like dust in the air. It seems invisible — even if you're choking on it — until you let the sun in."" Even Michael Jordan weighed in publicly, which to many was a surprise. The recent 10-part ESPN documentary, The Last Dance, lionized the legendary Chicago Bulls star, although it touched on a few perceived shortcomings, including what some see as Jordan's unwillingness to speak out on political issues. ""I do commend Muhammad Ali for standing up for what he believed in,"" Jordan said in the documentary, adding, ""but I never thought of myself as an activist. I thought of myself as a basketball player. ""I wasn't a politician when I was playing my sport. I was focused on my craft. Was that selfish? Probably. But that was my energy. That's where my energy was."" But now Jordan is speaking out, an indication of how deeply Floyd's death has resonated. ""I am deeply saddened, truly pained and plain angry,"" Jordan said in a statement posted on Twitter. ""I see and feel everyone's pain, outrage and frustration. I stand with those who are calling out the ingrained racism and violence toward people of color in our country. We have had enough."" There have been other heartfelt, and perhaps surprising, shows of solidarity. Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Carson Wentz also has been largely apolitical in his four years in the NFL. But last week, Wentz was one of the first prominent white athletes to speak out. ""Being from North Dakota, I've spent a large part of my life surrounded by people of similar color, so I'm never gonna act like I know what the black community goes through or even has gone through,"" Wentz said on Twitter. ""I'll never know the feeling of having to worry about my kids going outside because of their skin color. ... ""I don't understand the society we live in that doesn't value all human life. It's heartbreaking and disturbing. My prayers go out to every man, woman and child that has to endure the effects of the racism in our society."" Former and current African American teammates praised Wentz. ""You didn't have to say a thing but you did,"" former Eagles receiver Torrey Smith tweeted, adding, ""Love you bro."" Traditionally, Major League Baseball has, as a sport, avoided politics. Not now. A number of big leaguers have weighed in, including Washington Nationals relief pitcher Sean Doolittle. He's white, and he offered historical context in a tweet with the hashtag #BlackLivesMatter. ""Racism is America's Original Sin,"" Doolittle wrote. ""It was here before we even forged a nation, and has been passed down from generation to generation. And we still struggle to acknowledge that it even exists, much less atone for it. The generational trauma of racism and violence is killing black men and women before our eyes. ... ""We must not look away from the racism and violence. ... We must take action and call it out for what it is. We must recognize our shared humanity and atone for our Original Sin, or else we will continue to curse future generations with it. ""RIP George Floyd."" Still silence Even though the current environment seems to encourage sports figures to speak out, there's also notable silence coming from the sports world. So says LeVelle Moton. Moton is the men's basketball head coach at North Carolina Central University. He said white basketball and football coaches from the most prominent college conferences in the nation — the Power Five — are not speaking up. And he said he believes they should be. In fact, he said, they're obligated to do so. ""The reality is, a lot of these coaches have been able to create generational wealth,"" Moton told ESPN Radio. ""Their grandkids' kids are gonna be able to live a prosperous life because athletes who were the complexion of George Floyd were able to run a football, throw a football, shoot a basketball or whatever have you, so they have benefited greatly from athletes that look like George Floyd and many more. But whenever people the complexion of George Floyd are killed, assassinated, murdered in the street in broad daylight, they're silent."" Not all. Prominent white college basketball coaches have spoken out against Floyd's death, including the University of Kentucky's John Calipari, Roy Williams of the University of North Carolina and Michigan State University head coach Tom Izzo. Nick Saban is the most famous active head coach in Division 1 college football. He also released a statement about Floyd. ""We're at an important moment for our country,"" the University of Alabama coach said in a message that cited civil rights icons Rosa Parks and the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., ""and now is the time for us to choose kindness, tolerance, understanding, empathy, and most importantly ... it's time to love each other. Every life is precious, and we must understand we have so many more things that unite us than divide us."" Still, the complexity of Kaepernick Sunday's Houston Chronicle sports section went beyond the myriad athlete and coach statements of grief and resolve. It took a strong stand with a full-page editorial statement. The page had a picture of Floyd at the top and a kneeling Kaepernick at the bottom. In between, a section read, ""Imagine, if we had embraced Colin Kaepernick's peaceful protest and paid attention to the issue he was trying to address."" It wasn't the only connector between Floyd and Kaepernick. A dramatic meme circulating since Floyd's death shows a picture of the Minneapolis police officer kneeling on Floyd's neck, next to a picture of Kaepernick kneeling in protest. The visuals have stirred up the not-too-distant memory of Kaepernick's protest, which began in 2016, and was politicized from the beginning. And it's prompting harsh criticism of the NFL, even as the league joins the massive sports outpouring of grief and anger. Last weekend, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell released a statement offering condolences to Floyd's family as well as those of Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor, young African Americans also killed in recent high-profile cases. ""These tragedies inform the NFL's commitment and our ongoing efforts,"" Goodell said, adding, ""There remains an urgent need for action. We recognize the power of our platform in communities and as part of the fabric of American society. We embrace that responsibility and are committed to continuing the important work to address these systemic issues together with our players, clubs and partners."" Critics blasted Goodell for what they called hypocrisy. ""Colin Kaepernick asked the NFL to care about the lives of black people and they banned him from their platform,"" said Michael-Shawn Dugar, an NFL writer for The Athletic. Instead of prompting a discussion about police treatment of minorities and social inequality, Kaepernick's protests prompted a debate about patriotism and the flag, fueled by President Trump, who used an expletive to describe Kaepernick and other players who joined the pregame protests. Even though the NFL ultimately endorsed social justice initiatives, Kaepernick still is considered a pariah — no NFL owner has hired him. And with the league dealing with a significant lack of diversity in important head coaching and general manager positions, Goodell's critics said his reference to the league's ""commitment and our ongoing efforts"" is insincere. On their face, Goodell's words seemed in lockstep with much of the rest of the sports world as it grapples with and grieves over Floyd's death. But for many, the renewed attention on Kaepernick and his experience present just as powerful a message about the powerful NFL, where, in the volatile realm of race and justice, words appear louder than actions.

Pennsylvania is holding primary voting on Tuesday, though Gov. Tom Wolf extended the deadline for voting by mail by one week, until June 9. Here are the races to watch. Live results will appear Tuesday evening. Presidential primaries press on. Former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee, has not yet officially clinched the nomination. He went into the day 425 delegates short of the magic number of 1,991. With 500 delegates at stake Tuesday, he needs 85% of the delegates up for grabs, which he's unlikely to get. More likely, Biden will cross the threshold next week, June 9, when Georgia and West Virginia vote, with their 133 delegates at stake (and when we'll get the results of Pennsylvania's primary, with its 186 delegates). Rep. Steve King on the ropes. The controversial Iowa conservative faces real danger in his primary for reelection from Iowa's 4th Congressional District. After racist and pro-white nationalist remarks, much of the Republican establishment abandoned King. They've come for him before in his almost 20 years in Congress unsuccessfully. But this has been their best chance so far. King has trailed in the polls, with only $30,000 cash on hand and no TV ads running. The favorite among his challengers has been state Sen. Randy Feenstra, who has painted King as ineffective in the House, given that he was stripped of key committee assignments. But King is well known as a familiar choice for conservatives in western Iowa and has been resilient. Polls close at 10 p.m. ET Loading... In Iowa's 2nd Congressional District, Democratic Rep. Dave Loebsack is retiring, opening up his seat. Former state Sen. Rita Hart will be the Democratic nominee and will face either state Sen.

Joni Ernst, as well as House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. Former Sen. Rick Santorum and Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, a top Trump ally, have backed Schilling. Polls close at 10 p.m. ET Loading...

Wilkes, a single mother, was inspired by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's victory in New York in 2018 over another veteran white male Democratic leader. Wilkes raised $300,000 and said Hoyer, who has been in Congress almost 40 years, is out of touch with the district. The Democratic establishment has remained behind Hoyer, though, including the Congressional Black Caucus, which endorsed him. He has outspent Wilkes $2.7 million to $237,000.

Trump won there by 10 points in 2016, and the primary to decide who will take on Torres Small this fall is a contest between two Republican women. It has been a nasty primary between Yvette Herrell, the 2018 nominee, and Claire Chase, an oil executive. Both have campaigned on who's the most pro-Trump; Herrell got the backing of the House Freedom Caucus, but Chase has outraised and outspent Herrell, with support from Defending Main Street, a group with ties to establishment Republicans. Polls close at 9 p.m. ET Loading... Senate matchups to be set in Iowa and Montana. Democrats are hoping to take back the Senate this fall. They have an outside shot at that right now, but their odds have looked increasingly better of late. Partially, that's because of these two races. In Iowa, Democrats are targeting incumbent Republican Joni Ernst, but first there's the primary Tuesday. The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee has backed real estate executive Theresa Greenfield in the four-way contest. Greenfield raised $7.1 million and went into Tuesday as the favorite. Other Democrats include retired Adm. Mike Franken, attorney Kimberly Graham and Eddie Mauro, a businessman and former teacher and coach who has spent the second most — $1.4 million — on this primary. Polls close at 10 p.m. ET Loading... When Montana Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock changed his mind and decided to challenge incumbent Republican Sen. Steve Daines, it suddenly put this race on the map for Democrats in a big way. Three other Democrats are on the ballot Tuesday, but Bullock has been expected to win easily, raising more than 10 times what his next opponent has. Polls close at 10 p.m. ET Loading... Indiana openings. The retirements of moderate Democrat Pete Visclosky in Indiana's 1st District and Republican Susan Brooks, one of only 13 Republican women in Congress, in the 5th District has opened up both of these ideologically divergent seats. More than half a dozen Democrats are competing in the 1st District, which is suburban and exurban Chicago, a place that went for Hillary Clinton with 54% of the vote in 2016. Polls close at 7 p.m. ET Loading... In the 5th District, a handful of Republicans have duked it out, including state Sen. Victoria Spartz, who raised and spent the most and got the backing of the Club for Growth, and Beth Henderson, a local businesswoman with the endorsement of Indiana Sen. Mike Braun. Democrats have rallied around one candidate, Christina Hale. This district has been in GOP hands for a long time, but it could be one to watch this fall.

The upbraiding from the White House didn't sit well with many governors, who have been busy responding to clashes between protesters and law enforcement in dozens of U.S. cities sparked by the death a week ago of George Floyd after a Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck. Trump took a tough line with the governors, saying he was putting Attorney General William Barr in charge of the federal law enforcement response. The president said the White House was ""strongly looking for arrests."" ""You have to arrest people and you have to try people. And they have to go to jail for long periods of time,"" the president said. ""If people are running amok, you have to dominate. If you aren't dominating, you're wasting your time,"" he said. ""They're going to run over you; you're going to look like a bunch of jerks."" ""It's a movement. If you don't put it down, it will get worse and worse,"" Trump said. ""The only time it's successful is when you're weak and most of you are weak."" The call followed yet another night of unrest Sunday over the May 25 death of Floyd and came on the same day that the president in a Rose Garden address urged governors deploy National Guard troops to quell the unrest. ""If a city or state refuses to take the actions that are necessary to defend the life and property of their residents, then I will deploy the United States military and quickly solve the problem for them,"" he said. In the nation's capital, where U.S. Secret Service uniformed officers, military police and other law enforcement on Monday fired tear gas on peaceful protesters outside of the White House, Trump said he was already ""dispatching thousands and thousands of heavily armed soldiers, military personnel and law enforcement officers to stop the rioting, looting, vandalism, assaults and the wanton destruction of property."" While some governors, such as South Carolina's Henry McMaster, a Republican, praised Trump's calls for a crackdown, others took umbrage at the president's combative tone and questioned his authority to unilaterally deploy federal troops to the states. During the conference call, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, a Democrat, warned the president that the ""rhetoric coming out of the White House is making it worse,"" to which Trump snapped back, ""I don't like your rhetoric that much either."" ""I had to speak up, and I told him that his rhetoric is inflaming matters, that it's making things worse, and that we need to call for police reform,"" Pritzker told NPR's Morning Edition on Tuesday. ""We need to call for calm, that that's what the president should do and we need national leadership in this regard."" ""He unfortunately — you know,"" the governor added, ""he reacted badly."" Pritzker also said that what Trump's suggesting is ""illegal."" ""The governor of a state has to ask for federal help. I don't know any governor that intends to do that,"" he said. ""And secondly, you know, you can hear in his rhetoric that he is simply trying to make himself sound like a strong man — almost like a dictator, as if he's going to be responsible for bringing order all the way."" In Michigan, where police and protesters have skirmished in Grand Rapids despite many demonstrations remaining peaceful, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, called the president's remarks ""dangerous"" and said they should be ""gravely concerning to all Americans."" The president's comments, she said, ""send a clear signal that this administration is determined to sow the seeds of hatred and division, which I fear will only lead to more violence and destruction."" ""We must reject this way of thinking. This is a moment that calls for empathy, humanity, and unity,"" Whitmer said in a statement. ""This is one of the most challenging periods in our nation's history, but as Americans, we must remember our enemy is racial injustice, not one another."" The Republican governor of Massachusetts, Charlie Baker, said he wasn't surprised by the president's ""incendiary words."" ""At so many times during these last several weeks, when the country needed compassion and leadership the most, it simply was nowhere to be found,"" he said following the phone call with Trump. ""Instead, we got bitterness, combativeness and self-interest. That's not what we need in Boston, it's not what we need right now in Massachusetts,"" he said as his voice cracked with emotion, ""and it's definitely not what we need across this great country of ours either."" Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, a Democrat, called the president's remarks the ""rantings of an insecure man trying to look strong after building his entire political career on racism."" On the subject of the deploying of federal troops, Democratic New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo told CNN that he would respond to such an offer by saying, ""Thank you, but no thank you."" ""He wants to make this about looting because he doesn't want to talk about the killing of Mr. Floyd,"" Cuomo said. ""[He] doesn't want to really talk about racism and discrimination."" Kentucky Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear was reportedly not on the call with the president. Beshear was instead talking with the mother of Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old African American resident of Louisville who was killed in March by police executing a no-knock warrant. The president did praise one Democratic governor for his response to the unrest — Minnesota's Tim Walz, who fully mobilized National Guard troops on Saturday to supplement law enforcement. But at another point in the call, Trump called Minnesota ""a laughingstock all over the world."" Walz said Monday that he responded by saying: ""No one's laughing here. We're in pain. We're crying. We saw a man lose his life in front of them and our challenge is that this is about social trust, social compacts and reestablishing faith in the people who are there to serve them.""

1623295339,2020-06-02 06:08:00,What We're Reading About The Past Week Of Protests,https://www.kunm.org/post/what-were-reading-about-past-week-protests,en,False,"blacks, police, news and news media, demonstrations and riots, murders and attempted murders, police brutality and misconduct",146446,kunm.org,http://kunm.org/,"If you've been trying to keep up with news about the nationwide protests against police brutality, the stream of stories can be overwhelming. In the days following George Floyd's death in Minneapolis police custody, reporters have been covering the protests in more than 140 cities across the country, trying to make sense of this tumultuous moment. Here are some of the most illuminating stories that we've read this week to help us understand how we got here, and the larger issues driving the protests. Minneapolis in context This is hardly the first time that Minneapolis has erupted into protests about police brutality and the killings of black people. In 2016, people took to the streets after police shot and killed Philando Castile during a traffic stop in a nearby suburb, Falcon Heights. And in 2015, Minneapolis police shot and killed Jamar Clark, which ignited two weeks of protests. In the Boston Review, Elizabeth Hinton relates the current protests in Minneapolis to the ones that followed the deaths of Clark and Castile. She also looks at the nationwide unrest that followed the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968. Similar to the uprisings that took place more than half a century ago, she writes, Minneapolis residents are fed up with the ""buildup of unanswered grievances and the lack of concrete changes to their immediate living conditions."" ""Rather than responding to violent political rebellion with policy—such as addressing mass unemployment, failing public schools, and inhumane housing conditions—policymakers and officials, from Richard Nixon's War on Crime to the bipartisan War on Drugs to Donald Trump's embrace of 'Law and Order' politics, have consistently sought to manage the material consequences of socioeconomic problems (e.g., urban decay and drug abuse) with more police, more surveillance, and, eventually, more incarceration. We as a nation still fail to reckon with the wisdom King prophetically offered toward the end of his life: that only 'social justice and progress are the absolute guarantors of riot prevention. There is no other answer. Constructive social change will bring certain tranquility; evasions will merely encourage turmoil.' "" Policing Over at Slate, Joel Anderson writes that while many police chiefs are condemning the excessive use of force by the police officer who killed Floyd, it's important to pay attention to what police are doing during protests: ""The initial response of police leaders may have felt like progress, but video footage of police and protesters clashing in the streets reveals the truth: Officers are much closer to what we see in viral videos documenting their brutality than in the well-intentioned words of their leaders. Despite the shift in public statements, police haven't changed since the protests of 2014 and 2015."" Many protesters, including journalists, have captured police on tape pointing guns, shooting rubber bullets and tear gas at them. Matthew Dessem compiled a list at Slate of the ways police incited violence: ""Police all over the country tear-gassed protesters, drove vehicles through crowds, opened fire with nonlethal rounds on journalists or people on their own property, and in at least one instance, pushed over an elderly man who was walking away with a cane."" Existing while black The COVID-19 pandemic is still raging during the protests, and as we've reported, black people are dying from the virus at disproportionate rates. And as Annalisa Merelli at Quartz writes, police brutality is also a public health crisis that affects black people at a much higher rate than others: ""To give a sense of the magnitude of the crisis, the APHA reported that in 2016 alone (the latest year for which the organization could get reliable data, in itself a telling sign of the lack of priority accorded to the issue) at least 1,019 people were killed due to police intervention, and 76,440 were injured. This resulted in nearly 55,000 years of life lost, and had a large price tag, too: Police brutality costs $1.8 billion per year, according to the Centers for Disease Control's most recently available data (2010)."" Many argue that these two crises for the black community — police brutality and the coronavirus — aren't independent of each other. In fact, in both cases, the extent of the death toll stems from systemic discrimination, and in both cases, the solution may require a deep rethinking of the overall system. In The Atlantic, Ibram X. Kendi examines an 1896 document by a statistician that says black people were naturally selected for disease and death, and would gradually become extinct. Kendi goes on to write that ""too many Americans have been waiting for black extinction since Hoffman,"" and that black Americans are ""living in a nightmare"" rather than the elusive American dream: ""A nightmare is essentially a horror story of danger, but it is not wholly a horror story. Black people experience joy, love, peace, safety. But as in any horror story, those unforgettable moments of toil, terror, and trauma have made danger essential to the black experience in racist America. What one black American experiences, many black Americans experience. Black Americans are constantly stepping into the toil and terror and trauma of other black Americans. Black Americans are constantly stepping into the souls of the dead. Because they know: They could have been them; they are them. Because they know it is dangerous to be black in America, because racist Americans see blacks as dangerous."" Stories of solidarity Our NPR colleague Leila Fadel wrote about a Somali immigrant, Safia Munye, who opened a restaurant in Minneapolis more than two years ago — only to close her doors because of the coronavirus pandemic. However, the community rallied behind her business and raised more than $180,000 to reopen this weekend — that is, until it was burned down during the protests. But despite her loss, Munye says she wants justice for Floyd and change for Minneapolis. "" 'My heart is broken. My mind is broken,' she says. 'I know I can't come back from this. But this can be replaced. George's life cannot. George's life was more important. That man that got killed in the most inhumane way. I hope he gets justice.' "" And The New York Times brought us another story about resilience and solidarity, about a Bangladeshi family in Minneapolis who also lost their restaurant after it was burned down during one of the protests. Yet they support the uprising, and even opened the restaurant's doors as a medical haven for protesters. "" 'We were just trying to do what we could to help our community,' said [Hafsa] Islam, who helped treat wounded protesters. 'Sure, we had our business. Sure, we were trying to keep our kitchen open. But more than anything, we were concerned for our people.' ""The tension in [Ruhel] Islam's adopted city reminds him of his childhood in Bangladesh, when he lived through a dictatorship. Two of his fellow students were killed by the police, he said. 'We grew up in a traumatic police state, so I am familiar with this type of situation,' he said.""

Mayor Bill de Blasio had doubled down on a citywide curfew, moving it up from 11 p.m. a night earlier, but rejected urging from President Donald Trump and an offer from Gov. Andrew Cuomo to bring in the National Guard. Protests had resumed Tuesday during the day over the death of Floyd, a black man who died on May 25 after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed a knee on his neck even after he stopped moving and pleading for air. People marched in groups of thousands in parts of Manhattan and Brooklyn, as merchants boarded up their businesses. As the the curfew time arrived, many were still in the streets and continued marching, with officers initially standing by and allowing them. ADVERTISEMENTSkip ................................................................ But officers started ordering people to move along, and began taking people into custody. Demonstrators who had been on the West Side Highway in lower Manhattan were herded off, with parts of the roadway blocked off behind them. “Something has to break, and it’s not going to be us,” said Evan Kutcher, one of hundreds of demonstrators who stood outside the Barclays Center chanting Floyd’s name Tuesday evening. “We’re here because something needs to change. ___ WASHINGTON — The protest in the nation’s capital on Tuesday night lacked the tension of the previous nights’ demonstrations. The crowd outside Lafayette Park near the White House was peaceful, polite even, as they protested the death of George Floyd while in police custody in Minnesota. Instead of the spray-painted tags, the protesters Tuesday favored colorful children’s street chalk, writing Black Lives Matter slogans on the asphalt in front of St. John’s Church. Protesters chanted and talked among themselves, most wearing masks, but not social distancing in the age of COVID-19. One protester, Mati Yiheyis, a 21-year-old college student at the University of Virginia, speculated that fears of coronavirus kept many older people away. When one protester climbed a lamp post and removed a street sign he was roundly booed by others. “It’s not what we’re about,” said protester George “T.J.” Pierce of Washington. ADVERTISEMENTSkip ................................................................ The crowd started thinning out on its own after 8 p.m., an hour after a curfew went into place, although a core group of several hundred remained at the fence, chanting at the line of police and soldiers in riot gear on the other side. On Monday, law enforcement officers on foot and horseback aggressively drove protesters away from Lafayette Park, clearing the way for President Donald Trump to do a photo op at St. John’s Church, known as the church of presidents. On Tuesday, pastors at the church prayed with demonstrators and handed out water bottles. ___ LOS ANGELES — Thousands have taken to the streets of Los Angeles in peaceful protests Tuesday, and smaller demonstrations dotted other California cities while authorities renewed overnight curfews in LA and other areas that have seen clashes with police and groups of thieves wreck hundreds of businesses. There were several sizable demonstrations in Los Angeles and Mayor Eric Garcetti took a knee at one while in a crowd outside police headquarters. However, later in the day, hundreds gathered outside the mayor’s house and protested. Elsewhere in the city, police cordons backed by National Guard troops kept a tight watch on marchers in Hollywood, where hundreds were arrested a day earlier, and at a crowd of thousands at City Hall. In San Francisco, a mass of people marched up the Great Highway along San Francisco’s Ocean Beach. At San Jose’s City Hall, several hundred people showed up for a demonstration and speeches organized by the local branch of the NAACP. San Francisco Police Chief William Scott asked supervisors Tuesday to keep an overnight curfew order for at least the “next few days” to get ahead of people bent on using peaceful protests to pilfer stores and commit violence. Mayor London Breed ordered the 8 p.m. curfew Sunday following a night of thefts downtown, including at a major shopping mall where several fires were set. ADVERTISEMENTSkip ................................................................ ___ MINNEAPOLIS — The Minneapolis school board has voted to end its contract with the Minneapolis Police Department following the death last week of George Floyd. The Star Tribune reports the vote was unanimous Tuesday. Minneapolis Public Schools will stop further negotiations with the Police Department. Schools Superintendent Ed Graff must come up with a new plan for school safety by the board’s Aug. 18 meeting. School board chairwoman Kim Ellison said in an interview that she values “people and education and life.” Ellison said she’s now convinced, “based on the actions of the Minneapolis Police Department, that we don’t have the same values.” The Minneapolis and St. Paul school districts have faced criticism over the use of school resource officers. Both districts have sought to transform the role to be more of a mentor than an enforcer. ___ WASHINGTON — The U.S. Park Police denied using tear gas to disperse a crowd of protesters outside the White House on Monday night, saying officers instead used smoke canisters and pepper balls to aggressively push back the demonstrators. ADVERTISEMENTSkip ................................................................ Protesters scrambled as smoke filled the streets and AP journalists witnessed people reacting to their eyes and throats becoming irritated. Journalists covering the protest reported the crowd was largely peaceful at the time; the Park Police said they were responding to protesters throwing items, including bricks and frozen water bottles at law enforcement. Justice Department officials offered a different explanation, saying officers were carrying out Attorney General William Barr’s order to expand the security perimeter outside the White House. Officers repelled the crowd nearly 30 minutes ahead of a 7 p.m. curfew in Washington. Shortly after the crowd was pushed back, President Donald Trump walked through the park where they had gathered for a photo opportunity at a nearby church. ___ DALLAS — Former President George W. Bush criticized any effort to squelch protests of George Floyd’s death while in Minneapolis police custody. In a statement issued Tuesday by his office in Dallas, the former Republican president said he and wife Laura Bush “are anguished by the brutal suffocation of George Floyd and disturbed by the injustice and fear that suffocate our country.” Bush did not refer specifically toward President Donald Trump, but he called the harassment and threats toward African American protesters “a shocking failure.” “It is a strength when protesters, protected by responsible law enforcement, march for a better future. … Those who set out to silence those voices do not understand the meaning of America — or how it becomes a better place,” he said. ADVERTISEMENTSkip ................................................................ ___ MINNEAPOLIS — The mother of George Floyd’s 6-year-old daughter, Gianna, said Tuesday that she wanted the world to know that her little girl lost a good father who would never get to see his daughter grow up. “I want everybody to know that this is what those officers took. At the end of the day, they get to go home and be with their families,” Roxie Washington said during a Minneapolis news conference with her young daughter at her side. “I’m here for my baby and I’m here for George because I want justice for him. I want justice for him because he was good. No matter what anybody thinks, he was good.” Floyd died on Memorial Day after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee into the black man’s neck for several minutes even after he stopped moving and pleading for air. ___ LITTLE ROCK, Ark. — Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson declared a state of emergency Tuesday in response to continued demonstrations to protest the death of George Floyd in the custody of Minneapolis police. A statement from the governor’s spokeswoman said the action will unify command of local and state police, the Arkansas National Guard and the state Department of Emergency Management. The spokeswoman minimized the significance of the move, however. “This is a normal executive order issued when the National Guard is activated under state control in regard to civil disturbance. Under this executive order, sheriff offices and police departments maintain command and operational control of their respective jurisdictions,” Katie Beck said in her statement. ADVERTISEMENTSkip ................................................................ Also Tuesday, Little Rock Mayor Frank Scott expanded the city’s curfew a day after Arkansas authorities again used tear gas to break up protests outside the state Capitol. Scott said the city’s nighttime curfew will begin 8 p.m. ___ ATLANTA — Hundreds of protesters lingered on the streets of downtown Atlanta on Tuesday night ahead of another 9 p.m. curfew imposed by Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms. Authorities used armored vehicles to form a cordon at the state Capitol nearby. Bottoms has implemented the curfew every night, starting Saturday. As the curfew took effect, police and National Guard troops moved in, firing tear gas. The crowd quickly dispersed, and television footage showed police leading some people away in zip ties. ___ SEATTLE — Mayor Jenny Durkan addressed a large crowd protesting George Floyd’s death in Minneapolis, telling them their “voices holding me accountable are important.” ADVERTISEMENTSkip ................................................................ Tuesday was the fifth day of protests in the Northwest’s largest city over the death of Floyd in police custody. Monday’s protests were largely peaceful but turned chaotic as officers dispersed the crowd at night using tear gas and flash-bang devices. Authorities said demonstrators threw fireworks and tried to storm a barricade, but citizen video showed the chaos began when an officer grabbed a pink umbrella that a demonstrator was holding just across a barricade. Standing next to the city’s police chief at the downtown Emergency Operations Center, Durkan said she supported the crowd’s right to rally against injustice. “We want you to march, we want you to raise your voices, we want you to continue on your path of justice,” Durkan said over a microphone as the crowd listened, mostly in silence. “But we need you, please, to do it peacefully.” The mayor, a former U.S. attorney, then took questions from some in the crowd. ___ ST. PAUL, MINN. — Thousands of protesters gathered on the front lawn of the Minnesota Capitol as part of a youth protest for George Floyd on Tuesday afternoon. The crowd listened to speakers and periodically chanted slogans like, “Say his name: George Floyd.” William Ray, 22, said his protest was about more than just George Floyd’s death last week. His grandparents were civil rights activists in the 60s and also members of the Black Panther Party. “I grew up with an understanding of what needs to be done, growing up with them and seeing the change that they brought to the community. … America was built off of slaves — my ancestors. A lot of the systems that were in place then are still here,” he said. ADVERTISEMENTSkip ................................................................ Christine Ohenzuwa, 19, of Blaine, Minnesota, said she’s felt disheartened by the “endless cascade of hashtags of black people dying.” Of the unrest that has gripped cities across the nation, she said, “there’s always going to be a breaking point.” “It’s really painful to see what’s going on, but it’s also really important to understand that it’s connected to a system of racial violence,” she said. ___ WASHINGTON — A former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff says he was “sickened” to see National Guard troops and other security personnel forcibly clear protesters from a square near the White House to facilitate President Donald Trump’s walk to a nearby church to pose for photographers. Calling the visit Monday a “stunt,” Mike Mullen, a retired Navy admiral who headed the military from 2007 to 2011, wrote in The Atlantic on Tuesday it laid bare what he called Trump’s “disdain” for the rights of peaceful protesters. He said it also risked further politicizing the military. Mullen cautioned against an overly aggressive use of the military to restrain the sometimes-violent protests around the country. He said he has confidence in the professionalism of the troops but worries about the soundness of the orders they would be given by Trump. ___ MIAMI — A demonstration in Miami grew to about 400 people as protesters marched from a courthouse to a historically black neighborhood north of downtown. Demonstrators sat on one knee during several stops to listen to organizers shouting instructions that they were to remain peaceful and hydrated in the 80-degree weather. They shouted “No justice, no peace, no racist police” as more than 30 officers followed the group a few blocks behind wearing body armor. Twenty-two-year-old Trinity Auberry arrived at the demonstration with four other friends. It was the first time protesting for the young black model who said the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis is not isolated and cases of “police brutality” are also common in Florida. ___ CHARLESTON, W.Va. — The West Virginia National Guard is pursuing disciplinary action against a guardsman who posted on social media that he would shoot at people protesting the death of George Floyd, officials said Tuesday. The guardsman, Noah Garcelon, has already resigned his position as an officer with the Winfield Police Department after making the comments. In a series of now-deleted posts, Garcelon wrote that he would “start firing live rounds” at protesters and “see how many I can run over before my car breaks down.” Maj. Gen. James Hoyer, who leads the state’s National Guard, said officials will be taking the appropriate disciplinary action related to Garcelon and any others “who make inflammatory comments related to protests going on across the nation.” Winfield Police Department Chief Ron Arthur said Garcelon acknowledged that he made the comments and stressed that he wasn’t a racist before resigning. West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice, a Republican, has urged people to remain peaceful but said he would not hesitate to call in the National Guard if demonstrations in the state became violent. ___ COLUMBIA, S.C. — About 100 people gathered in front of the state capitol building in downtown Columbia, South Carolina, on Tuesday afternoon as medics passed out water bottles and snacks and volunteers passed out voter registration forms. Participants raised their fists in unison as passing commuters showed their solidarity with honks and waves. An outreach minister emphasized the need to sustain demonstrations past the initial events over the weekend and also urged a peaceful nature in the afternoon’s demonstrations. Minister Danielle Ford told the crowd, “they’re waiting on us to give up, they’re waiting on us to get tired, they’re waiting on us to give in. We need you out here.” A 21-year-old college student said she was protesting for justice for George Floyd as well as Joshua Ruffin, a 17-year-old shot to death by a Columbia police officer after a foot chase in April. ___ HOUSTON — Houston rappers Bun B and Trae Tha Truth organized a march on Tuesday and told the crowd it would be peaceful. After asking the crowd of several thousand to look for anybody who could cause trouble, Bun B then led them on a chant. He said “What’s his name?” and the crowd replied, “George Floyd.” The crowd later got down on one knee and was silent for 30 seconds. Among those participating was a group of about 60 people on horseback from a riding club in Houston. ___ LOS ANGELES — Los Angeles Police Chief Michel Moore said Tuesday more than 2,700 people have been arrested since protests and violence began in the nation’s second-largest city. The chief told the city Police Commission that about 2,500 of those arrests were for failure to disperse or curfew violations. The remainder were for crimes including burglary, looting, assaults on police officers and other violence. The chief gave the figures during a report to the Police Department’s civilian oversight board. Several new demonstrations in Los Angeles on Tuesday over the death of George Floyd have remained peaceful. ___ PARIS — Riot officers have fired tear gas as scattered protesters threw projectiles and set fires during an unauthorized demonstration against police violence and racial injustice. Several thousand people had previously rallied peacefully for two hours Tuesday around the main Paris courthouse in homage to George Floyd and to Adama Traore, a French black man who died in police custody. Police had banned the protest because of coronavirus restrictions that forbid any gathering of more than 10 people. As the demonstration wound down, police fired tear gas and protesters could be seen throwing projectiles. Two small fires broke out. Tensions also erupted at a related protest Tuesday in the southern city of Marseille. ___ CHICAGO — Authorities in a Chicago suburb where two people were fatally shot in unrest following George Floyd’s death are issuing fresh safety precautions Tuesday. Cicero officials cautioned residents to “stay home and stay off the streets” a day after violence and destruction erupted in the town of about 84,000 west of Chicago. Police say most of Monday’s chaos stemmed from residents trying to defend businesses. Roughly 60 people were arrested, mostly for burglary and weapons violations. Two men in their 20s were fatally shot around 6 p.m. in separate incidents related to the violent clashes. ___ TRENTON, N.J. — Citing George Floyd’s death, New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir Grewal said Tuesday the state will update its guidelines governing the use of force by police for the first time in two decades and will move to require a statewide licensing program for all officers. At least 43 other states require some licensing requirement for officers, Grewal said, adding he wants to bring law enforcement in line with other professions that require licensing. The announcements also include a pilot program in a handful of cities across the state to conduct training programs aimed at promoting safe interactions between police and communities and the implementation of a statewide database to document when police use force, Grewal said. ___ MINNEAPOLIS — The state of Minnesota has filed a civil rights charge against the Minneapolis Police Department in the wake of George Floyd’s death. The state says it will investigate the department’s policies and practices over the last 10 years to determine whether it has engaged in “systemic” discrimination against people of color. The complaint comes from the state Department of Human Rights, which enforces the state’s human rights act. It targets a police department that has faced decades of allegations of brutality and other discrimination against African-Americans and other minorities including within the department itself. Critics say the department has a culture that resists change and the department has come under fresh criticism after Floyd died after a white officer knelt on his neck and ignored his cries of “I can’t breathe” until Floyd eventually stopped moving. ___ WASHINGTON — Attorney General William Barr ordered law enforcement officials to clear Lafayette Park and push back the perimeter around the White House when he arrived there Monday evening, leading to police using tear gas to disperse protesters. A person familiar with the matter tells The Associated Press that Barr expected the perimeter to have been extended much earlier Monday. The person could not discuss the matter publicly and spoke to AP on condition of anonymity. The person said officials had met that morning and decided the perimeter had to be moved by at least one full block after multiple fires were set in the park the night before. They said that was expected to happen by Monday afternoon. The person said Barr was surprised it hadn’t been done when he arrived in the early evening and directed action to be taken. They said he assumed police would use “typical crowd control measures” against protesters who resisted commands to clear the area. ___ MINNEAPOLIS — Prosecutors are delaying the case against a man who drove his semitrailer into a crowd of protesters on a closed Minneapolis freeway. The 35-year-old man drove his tanker truck into the midst of thousands of people who had gathered on Interstate 35W near downtown Minneapolis on Sunday. Authorities said it appeared no one was hurt and the man was arrested. Gov. Tim Walz said the man became confused and somehow got on the freeway before traffic officials closed it. Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman announced Tuesday that the case against the man has been deferred pending further investigation and he’ll be released from jail. Freeman said investigators are working to gather additional information to help in making a charging decision. ___ WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump ordered military aircraft to fly above the nation’s capital Monday night as a “show of force” against demonstrators protesting the death of George Floyd, according to two Department of Defense officials. Show-of-force missions are designed to intimidate and, in combat zones, warn opposing forces of potential military action if provoked. The officials, who insisted on anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss ongoing operations publicly, did not say how many or what type of aircraft had been mobilized. Videos and photographs posted on social media showed helicopters flying low over buildings and hovering just above groups who were on the street despite a district-wide curfew. On Tuesday, roughly 700 members of the Army’s 82nd Airborne Division had arrived at two military bases near Washington. Another 1,400 soldiers are ready to be mobilized within an hour, the two Pentagon officials said. The soldiers are armed and have riot gear as well as bayonets. The officials said the mission has been named “Operation Themis.” In Greek mythology, Themis was a titaness of divine law and order, whose symbols are the scales of justice. — Reporting by James LaPorta",0.0

Andrew Cuomo has not deployed the state’s National Guard to New York City, although he said earlier Monday the state had 13,000 troops that “we can use at any moment.” “I say thank you but no thank you,” Cuomo said on CNN about Trump’s call to send military troops to the states. At least 23 states and the District of Columbia had already deployed guard troops as of Monday morning, according to a statement from the National Guard. It wasn’t clear whether the action would be enough to satisfy the president. Trump took no questions from reporters and did not say how he would decide whether a state’s response was sufficient. Democratic Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington, who has activated the state’s guard, said in a statement he prays “no soldier and no civilian is injured or killed by this reckless fit.” “This president has repeatedly proven he is incapable of governing and shown nothing but false bravado throughout the chaos that has accompanied his time in office,” Inslee said in a statement. Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak, also a Democrat, said any suggestions the state’s National Guard is ill equipped to handle the states needs is “misinformed.” “As the Commander In Chief of the Nevada National Guard I can state, categorically, that they have done their duty to protect all Nevadans, and will continue to do so.” In neighboring Oregon, Gov. Kate Brown said the violence is being perpetrated by a small segment of demonstrators. She refused to deploy the National Guard on Sunday at Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler’s request because she was concerned it would escalate a tense situation, but on Monday activated 50 unarmed guard members in support roles. ADVERTISEMENTSkip ................................................................ “You don’t defuse violence by putting soldiers on the streets,” Brown, a Democrat, said earlier Monday in reaction to Trump’s comments about governors being weak in their response. “Trump wants governors to deploy the National Guard as a show of force to intimidate the public. I want to ensure that the public can safely raise their voices in this much-needed call for reform.” She didn’t immediately comment on Trump’s remarks about deploying the U.S. military. Nor did California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who has deployed thousands of guard troops to Los Angeles and other cities. He called Trump’s morning comments “noise” and avoided addressing them directly, although he said the nation is desperate for leadership. Guard members can assist law enforcement and perform duties such as traffic control, communications support and extinguishing fires. __ Associated Press writers Gillian Flaccus in Portland, Oregon, Rachel La Corte in Olympia, Washington, and Michelle Price in Las Vegas contributed to this report.",0.0

Among such concerns are the future of the two major economies of the world, China and the U.S and whether widespread protests in the U.S. will set off another rise in COVID-19 cases. On Wall Street, the S&P 500 closed 0.8% higher, at 3,080.82, after wavering throughout the morning. Technology, industrial and health care sector stocks accounted for a big slice of the gains. Energy stocks far outpaced the rest of the market as the price of crude rose ahead of a meeting of major oil producers. Bond yields climbed, another sign of ebbing pessimism among investors. So far, Wall Street’s momentum has not been derailed by the wave of daily unrest across the U.S. that began last week in Minneapolis as a protest over police brutality. Cities across the country have been rocked by violence and destruction for seven days in a row, drawing threats from the White House to send troops in to put down the unrest. “The market action seems to have a lot more to do with people’s confidence about the economic reopening,” said Tom Hainlin, national investment strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management. “It’s happening irrespective to what we’re seeing socially across the country right now.” The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.1% to 25,742.65.

Stocks have now recouped most of their losses after the initial economic fallout from the coronavirus knocked the market into a staggering 34% skid in February and March. The S&P 500 is now down 9% from its all-time high in February. Investors are hoping that the worst of the recession has already passed, or will soon, as governments around the country and around the world slowly lift the restrictions that left broad swaths of the U.S. economy at a standstill beginning in March. While more countries and sectors are reopening, economic activity is expected to remain subdued as social distancing rules complicate plans to get back to business. Meanwhile, investors continue to keep an eye out for any signs that the reopening of the economy is leading to a resurgence in COVID-19 cases. In Japan, Tokyo reported 34 newly confirmed cases on Tuesday, leading city officials to declare a largely symbolic “alert” for more social distancing. The Rainbow Bridge in Tokyo was lit red to remind residents. Before Tuesday, daily new infections had dropped below 20 recently. Bond yields were mostly higher. The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 0.71% from 0.68% late Tuesday. Benchmark U.S. crude added 76 cents to $37.57 a barrel. It rose $1.37 to $36.81 a barrel on Tuesday. Brent crude oil for August delivery gained 54 cents to $40.11 a barrel.

Chanting “I can’t breathe,” thousands marched peacefully through Australia’s largest city, while thousands more demonstrated in the Dutch capital of The Hague and hundreds rallied in Tel Aviv. Expressions of anger erupted in multiple languages on social networks, with thousands of Swedes joining an online protest and others speaking out under the banner of #BlackOutTuesday. Diplomatic ire percolated too, with the European Union’s top foreign policy official saying the bloc was “shocked and appalled” by Floyd’s death. Floyd died last week after a police officer pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes even after he stopped moving and pleading for air. The death set off protests that spread across America — and now, beyond. As demonstrations escalated worldwide, solidarity with U.S. protesters increasingly mixed with local worries. “This happened in the United States, but it happens in France, it happens everywhere,” Paris protester Xavier Dintimille said. While he said police violence seems worse in the U.S., he added, “all blacks live this to a degree.” Fears of the coronavirus remain close to the surface and were the reason cited for banning Tuesday’s protest at the main Paris courthouse, because gatherings of more than 10 people remain forbidden. But demonstrators showed up anyway. Some said police violence worsened during virus confinement in working class suburbs with large minority populations, deepening a feeling of injustice. As the Paris demonstration wound down, police fired volley after volley of tear gas and protesters threw debris. Police were less visible than usual at the city’s frequent protests. Tensions also erupted at a related protest in the southern city of Marseille. ADVERTISEMENTSkip ................................................................ The demonstrations were held in honor of Traore, who died shortly after his arrest in 2016, and in solidarity with Americans demonstrating against Floyd’s death. The Traore case has become emblematic of the fight against police brutality in France. The circumstances of the death of the 24-year-old Frenchman of Malian origin are still under investigation after four years of conflicting medical reports about what happened. The lawyer for two of the three police officers involved in the arrest, Rodolphe Bosselut, said the Floyd and Traore cases “have strictly nothing to do with each other.” Bosselut told The Associated Press that Traore’s death wasn’t linked with the conditions of his arrest but other factors, including a preexisting medical condition. Traore’s family says he died from asphyxiation because of police tactics — and that his last words were “I can’t breathe.” “I can’t breathe” were also the final words of David Dungay, a 26-year-old Aboriginal man who died in a Sydney prison in 2015 while being restrained by five guards. As 3,000 people marched peacefully through Sydney, many said they had been inspired by a mixture of sympathy for African Americans and to call for change in Australia’s treatment of its indigenous population, particularly involving police. The mostly Australian crowd at the authorized demonstration also included protesters from the U.S. and elsewhere. “I’m here for my people, and for our fallen brothers and sisters around the world,” said Sydney indigenous woman Amanda Hill, 46, who attended the rally with her daughter and two nieces. “What’s happening in America shines a light on the situation here.” Even as U.S. President Donald Trump fanned anger by threatening to send in troops on American protesters, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau refrained from directly criticizing him and said the protests should force awareness of racism everywhere. ADVERTISEMENTSkip ................................................................ “We all watch in horror and consternation what’s going on in the United States,” he said after pausing 21 seconds before answering. “But it is a time for us as Canadians to recognize that we, too, have our challenges, that black Canadians and racialized Canadians face discrimination as a lived reality every single day. There is systemic discrimination in Canada.” More protests in various countries are planned later in the week, including a string of demonstrations in front of U.S. embassies on Saturday. The drama unfolding in the U.S. drew increasing diplomatic concern. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell’s remarks in Brussels were the strongest to come out of the 27-nation bloc, saying Floyd’s death was a result of an abuse of power. Borrell told reporters that “like the people of the United States, we are shocked and appalled by the death of George Floyd.” He underlined that Europeans “support the right to peaceful protest, and also we condemn violence and racism of any kind, and for sure, we call for a de-escalation of tensions.” German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said peaceful protests in the U.S. following Floyd’s death are “understandable and more than legitimate.” “I can only express my hope that the peaceful protests do not continue to lead to violence, but even more express the hope that these protests have an effect in the United States,” Maas said. More African leaders are speaking up over the killing of Floyd.

CAIRO — After his arrest in 2013 for documenting the deadliest crackdown on protesters in Egypt’s modern history, Mohamed Soltan landed in a notorious prison where he says he was brutally tortured for 21 months. He never thought he’d get a chance to fight back, let alone make it out alive. But on Monday, Soltan, a 32-year-old U.S. citizen now living in Virginia, used a federal statute to accuse former Egyptian prime minister Hazem el-Beblawi of crimes against humanity. The 1991 Torture Victims Protection Act allows for victims of torture and extrajudicial killings committed by foreign officials abroad to seek justice through the American court system. ADVERTISEMENTSkip ................................................................ It’s the first such case against an Egyptian official, made possible by the grim coincidence that el-Beblawi now lives just miles from Soltan, in Washington, where he is an executive director of the International Monetary Fund. “He’s completely gotten away with it, and is walking free downtown,” Soltan said. “I just want to regain some of the justice and dignity stripped away from me.” El-Beblawi, contacted through the IMF, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In the summer of 2013, after the military-led ouster of the country’s first democratically elected but divisive president, Mohamed Morsi, Egyptian security officers descended on a protest camp packed with his Islamist supporters, killing hundreds. Soltan, an Ohio State graduate and the son of a prominent member of the now-outlawed Muslim Brotherhood, was shot in the arm while working as a stringer for Western news organizations in Rabaa al-Adawiya Square. Before long he was picked up by security forces. In a mass trial widely condemned by human rights groups, Soltan was sentenced to life in prison on charges of spreading “fake news” to tarnish Egypt’s image. In the maximum-security Tora prison complex, Soltan says he endured unspeakable torments overseen by el-Beblawi and other high-ranking officers. He says he was denied medical care for his festering bullet wound, beaten to unconsciousness, held in solitary confinement and forced to listen to the sounds of his father being tortured in a nearby cell. He lost 160 pounds over the course of a 16-month hunger strike to protest his unjust imprisonment. Under pressure from the Obama administration, Egypt released Soltan in 2015, although his father remains in prison. He has attempted to build a new life in Virginia, advocating for fellow political prisoners still in Egypt and pursuing a master’s degree at Georgetown University. But memories from his dark cell in Tora still haunt him. “There’s this perpetual, compounded trauma every single day,” he said, “where you get up and look in the mirror and see the scars and cigarette burns and the bullet marks…it changes you.” Eric Lewis, a lawyer with Lewis Baach Kaufmann Middlemiss, who represents Soltan, says he hopes the case sends a message to Egypt’s government “that they cannot commit crimes against humanity and then seek haven in the United States.” An estimated 60,000 political prisoners languish in Egypt’s jails, according to Human Rights Watch, including many journalists and critics held on vague terrorism charges without trial. President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi, who came to power in 2013, has waged an unprecedented crackdown on dissent. The lawsuit lists el-Sissi, intelligence chief Abbas Kamel and three other former senior security officials as culpable, saying that they can be served if they set foot in the United States.",0.0

The scene was jarring: Police violently broke up a peaceful and legal protest by several thousands in Lafayette Park across from the White House ahead of a speech in the Rose Garden by President Donald Trump. The protesters had gathered in the park on a sunny evening Monday following the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis a week earlier. The police fired tear gas and rubber bullets and deployed flash bangs. As police directly confronted the protesters, many held up their hands, saying, “Don’t shoot.” In his speech, Trump declared himself “the president of law and order,” and he threatened to deploy the U.S. military unless states halt violent protests. As an additional show of force, he announced he was deploying even more of the military to Washington, giving it the feel of an armed, locked-down city after days of unrest. Afterward, Trump strolled out of the White House gates — something he had never done before — and walked across the cleared Lafayette Park to make a surprise visit to St. John’s Church. Every president has prayed at the landmark pale yellow building, although it was damaged Sunday in a fire during the protests. Trump, standing alone in front of cameras, raised a Bible.

Teoh. All the elected officials that air here bring ingredients. I can't breathe. I can't breathe. George floors last words, but they didn't die with him. You're still being heard going all across this nation. They speak to a nation where too often, just the color of your skin put your life at risk. They speak to the nation were more than 100,000 people have lost their lives a virus and 40 million have filed for unemployment. With the disproportionate number of those deaths and job losses concentrated black and brown communities, they speak to a nation where every day millions of people and millions not at the moment of losing their life but in the course of living their life are saying to themselves, I can't breathe. It's a wake up call to our nation. In my view, it's for all of us, and I mean all of us. It's not the first time we've heard those words. They're the same words we heard from Eric Garner when his life was taken away six years ago. But it's time to listen to those words, to try to understand, to respond to him respond with action. A country is crying out for leadership leadership that can you. Nine US leadership That brings us together. Leadership that could recognize pain and deep grief of communities that have had a knee on the neck for a long time. There's no place for violence, no place for looting or destroying property or burning churches. There's during businesses. Many have been built by the very people of color who are first time in their lives, are beginning to realize their dreams and bill wealth for their families. Nor is it acceptable for police sworn to protect and serve all people escalate tension, resort to excessive violence, way need to distinguish between legitimate peaceful protests and opportunistic, violent destruction. We have to be vigilant about the violence that's being done by this incumbent president, to our economy and to the pursuit of justice. Would peaceful protesters dispersed in order for a president, a president from the doorstep of the People's House, the White House, using tear gas and flash grenades in order to stage a photo op? A photo of one of the most historic churches in the country, or at least in Washington, D. C. We can be forgiven for believing the president's more interesting in power, then in principle were just serving the passions of his based on the needs of the people in his care, for that's what the presidency is, the duty to care, to care for all of us, not just those who vote for us, but all of us, not just our donors, but all of us. The president held up the Bible at ST John's Church. I just wish he opened it once in a while, said a brandishing. If he opened it, he could have learned something. They're all called love one another as we love ourselves. It's really hard work, but it's the work of America. Donald Trump is interested in doing that work. Instead, he's preening and sweeping away all the guard rails. Lo have protected our democracy guard rails. I helped make possible this nation's path to a more perfect union, a union that constantly requires reform and rededication. And, yes, the protest from voices that are mistreated, ignored, left out or left behind. But it is a union you worth fighting for. That's why I'm running for pressure. In addition of the Bible, the president might also want open the U. S. Constitution. If he did, he'd find a thing called the First Amendment What it says, Beginning says the right of the people peaceably to assemble and to petition their government for redress of grievances. That's kind of an essential motion building into this country, Mr President. That's America. That's America. No horses rising up on their hind legs to push back peaceful protests, not using the American military to move against the American people. This is a nation of values. Our freedom to speak is a cherished knowledge that lives inside every American. Almost from the time your kids we're gonna allow any president to quiet our voice. We won't let those who see this is an opportunity to sow chaos. Throw up a smokescreen to distract us and very really religion legitimate grievances. At the heart of these protests, we can We can't leave this moment. I can't leave this moment thinking that we can once again turn away and do nothing. Can't do that this time. We just can't. The moment has come for our nation to deal with systemic graces to deal with the growing economic inequity that exists in our nation to deal with the denial of the promise of this nation made to so many. No, I've said from the outset of this election that were in the battle for the soul of this nation. We are in the battle for the soul of a nation. What we believe, maybe most importantly, who we want to be. It's all steak that's sure today than it's ever been leased in my lifetime. And it's this urgent. It's in the services we can find a path forward. Now the history of this nation teaches us that is some of our darkest moments of despair. We've made some of our greatest progress somewhere. Darkest moment. 13 14 15th Amendments follow the Civil War The greatest economic growth in world history grew out of the Great Depression. Civil Rights Act of 1964 and 65. Voting Rights Act of 65 came in the tracks of Bull Connor's vicious dogs. Prior phrase Reverend Barber. It's the morning we find hope. It's in the morning. We find hope when we more it's gonna take more than talk. Had talked before, read protest before we've got a now vowed to make this at least in their of action and reverse the systemic racism with a long overdue concrete changes. The action will not be completed in the 1st 100 days of my presidency. If I'm fortunate to be elected or even in my entire term, it's gonna take the work of a generation. But if this agenda will take time to complete, it should not wait for the 1st 100 days of my presidency to get started. A down payment, What is long overdue should come now should come immediately. I call in the Congress to act this month on measures that would be the first step in this direction, starting with real police reform. Congressman Jeffries has a bill to outlaw. Joe calls. Congress should put it on the president's desk in the next few days. The other measures to stop transferring weapons of war to police forces improve oversight and accountability to create a model use of force standard that also should be made long this month. No more excuses, no delays. If Mitch McConnell can bring in the United States Senate to confirm Trump's on qualified judicial nominees who will run roughshod over our constitution now it's time to pass legislation will give true meaning to our constitutional promise of equal protection under the law. Looking ahead, in the 1st 100 days of my presidency, I've committed to creating a national police oversight Commission. I've long believed we need riel community policing. We need each and every police Department of Country to understand a comprehensive review of the undertaking conference review of their hiring, their training de escalation. Some have already done it somehow are in the process of doing it. The federal government should give give the cities and states the tools and the resources they need to implement reforms. More police officers meet the higher standards of the procession. Most of them do it all. The more reason why bad cops should be dealt with severely and swiftly. We all need to take a hard look at the culture allows for the senseless tragedies to keep happening. We need to learn from the cities in the precincts that are getting it right. We know though we have in order to have true American justice, we need economic justice as well. Here, too, is there's much to be done. As a media step. Congress should act should act now to rectify racial inequities that allow Cove in 19 recovery funds to be diverted from where they live. I'll be setting forth my Jenna and economic justice and opportunity in the weeks and months ahead. But it begins with health care. Health care should be a right, not a privilege of the quickest route to universal coverage of this country's expand on Obama care. We could do it. We should do it. But this president, even now in the midst of a public health crisis with massive unemployment, well want to destroy it. He doesn't care how many millions Americans will be hurt because he's consumed with his blind. Any go when it comes to Barack Obama. President Obama. The presidency would draw his lawsuit to strike down Obamacare, and the Congress should prepare to pass the act. I proposed to expand Obama care to millions Mawr. So everyone's covered his last words. We've seen America's true heroes health care workers, docks, nurses, delivery truck drivers, grocery store workers. You know, we've come up with new phrase from essential workers. Essential worker way need to do more than praise them. We need to pay them. We need to pay them because we weren't clear before. It's clear now. This country wasn't built by Wall Street bankers and CEOs was built by the great American middle class, which is built by unions and are essential workers. You know, I know there's enormous fear and uncertainty and anger in the country. I understand. I know so many Americans are suffering, suffering, loss of a loved one. So for an economic hardship, wondering, can I feed my family tomorrow? What's gonna have suffering under the weight of a generation after generation after generation, I've heard inflicted on people of color black brown in native communities in particular. Like many of you, I know what it means. Degree. My losses are not the same as loss is felt by so many. But I know what it feels like when you think you can't go on. I know what it means to have that black hole in your chest where your grief is being sucked into it. Just a few days ago, mark the fifth anniversary of my son most passing. There are still moments when the pain is so great it feels no different than the day I sat in that bed as he passed away. But I also knew, but the best way to bear loss and pain to turn it into that anger and anguish in the purpose. And Americans know what our purposes is a nation. It has to be guided. Mr. Guided guided us from the very beginning. No, it's been reported the day that President John F. Kennedy was assassinated. Little Yolanda King came home from school in Atlanta and jumped in her daddy's arms, said, Oh, Daddy, she said, Now we're never going to get our freedom. Daddy was reassuring, Strong, brave. He said, No, don't worry, baby. It's gonna be OK. It's gonna be all right. Amid the violence and fear, Dr King persevered. He was driven by his dream of a nation where justice runs down like water and righteousness like a mighty stream. Then 19 68. Hate cut him down in Memphis two days before Dr Key was murdered. Hey gave a final Sunday sermon to Washington. No, he told us that though the arc of the moral universe is long said, it bends towards justice and we know we can bend it because we have. We have to believe that still, that's our purpose. It's been our purpose in the very beginning, to become a nation where all men and women are not only creating, but they're treated equally, not just credited, would treated equally to become a nation to find, in Dr King's words, not only by the absence of tension before the presence of justice, I'm not just a not attention but justice. Today in America, it's hard to keep faith the justices hated. I know that, you know pain is raw, the pain is really president of states must be part of the solution, not the problem. But this president today is part of the problem and accelerates. When you treated the words when the looting starts, the shooting starts. They weren't the words present. Their words of a racist Miami police chief in the sixties when he tweeted the protesters quote, would have been greeted with the most vicious dogs when people would have been really hurt. End of quote. They weren't the words of a president. They were the kind of words Bull Connor would have used, unleashing his dogs on innocent women and Children. You know, the American story is a story about action and reaction that's actually works. We can't be naive about it. I wish I could say that Hate began with Donald Trump will. And with him it didn't and it won't. American history is in a fairy tale with a guaranteed happy ending. The battle for the soul of this nation has been a constant push and pull for more than 240 years, a tug of war between the American ideal that we're all created equal in the harsh reality that racism has long torn us apart. The honest truth is that both elements are part of the American character, both elements at our best. The American ideal wins out, but it's never around. It's always a fight, and the battle is never fully one. But we can't ignore the truth that we're at our best when we open our hearts rather than clinch our fish. Donald Trump has turned this country in a battlefield driven by old resentments and fresh fears. He thinks division helps him. His narcissism has become more important than the nation's well being that he leads. I ask every American I mean this in the bottom, or ask every American look at where we are now and thinking new. Is this who we are? Is this what we want to be? Is this you want to pass on to our Children and our grandchildren? Fear, anger, finger pointing, rather the pursuit of happiness, incompetence and anxiety, self absorbed selfishness? Or do we want to be the America we know? We can be American. We know in our hearts we could be and should be. Look, I look at the presidency as a very big job and nobody we'll get it right every time. And I won't either. But I promise you this. I won't traffic in fear and division. I won't fan the flames of hate. I'll seek the heal, the racial wounds that have long plagued our country, not used them for political gain. I'll do my job and I will take responsibility. I won't blame others. I'll never forget. I will never forget. I promise you, this job is not about me. It's about you. It's about us work now gone to rebuild the nation, but build it better than it was. We're the only nation of the world that goes through a crisis and comes out better to build a better future That's what America does to build a better future. We build the future. It may in fact, be the most American thing to do. Build the future. We hunger for liberty the way Harriet Tubman and Frederick Douglass did. We thirst for the vote like Susan B. Anthony and Ella Baker and John Lewis. Did we strive to explore the stars, cure disease, make an in perfect union more perfect than has been? We may come up short, but at our best we try. My fellow Americans were facing a formidable enemies. They include not only the Corona virus and the table impact on the lives and livelihoods, but also the selfishness and fear that have loomed over our national life for the last three years. I choose those words advisedly, selfishness and fear. Defeating those enemies requires us to do our duty, and that duty includes remembering who we should be, who we should be. We should be the America of F. D. R. And Eisenhower of Rosa Parks and Martin Luther King Jr. Jonah Salt. Neil Armstrong. We should be the America that cherishes life, liberty and courage, and above all, we should be in America that chairs each other each and every one of us. You know, we're a nation in pain. We must let let our pain destroys. We're nation and raged. We can not our rage consume us. We're a nation. It's exhausted. But we will not allow our exhaustion to fetus as presidents. My commitment to all of you to lead on these issues and to listen because I truly believe in my heart of hearts we can't overcome. We stand together. Finally, is one America. We'll rise stronger than we were before. We'll move that art closer to justice. We'll reach out to one another for speak out for one another. And please, please do what's recently been happening. Take care of one another. This is the United States of America. There's never been anything we've been unable to do when we set our mind to do it. We've done it together together, united. That's we are at our best. God bless you all. May God protect our troops que Mr Mayor. Thanks for hospitality. Teoh. All the elected officials that air here bring ingredients. I can't breathe. I can't breathe. George floors last words, but they didn't die with him. You're still being heard going all across this nation. They speak to a nation where too often, just the color of your skin put your life at risk. They speak to the nation were more than 100,000 people have lost their lives a virus and 40 million have filed for unemployment. With the disproportionate number of those deaths and job losses concentrated black and brown communities, they speak to a nation where every day millions of people and millions not at the moment of losing their life but in the course of living their life are saying to themselves, I can't breathe. It's a wake up call to our nation. In my view, it's for all of us, and I mean all of us. It's not the first time we've heard those words. They're the same words we heard from Eric Garner when his life was taken away six years ago. But it's time to listen to those words, to try to understand, to respond to him respond with action. A country is crying out for leadership leadership that can you. Nine US leadership That brings us together. Leadership that could recognize pain and deep grief of communities that have had a knee on the neck for a long time. There's no place for violence, no place for looting or destroying property or burning churches. There's during businesses. Many have been built by the very people of color who are first time in their lives, are beginning to realize their dreams and bill wealth for their families. Nor is it acceptable for police sworn to protect and serve all people escalate tension, resort to excessive violence, way need to distinguish between legitimate peaceful protests and opportunistic, violent destruction. We have to be vigilant about the violence that's being done by this incumbent president, to our economy and to the pursuit of justice. Would peaceful protesters dispersed in order for a president, a president from the doorstep of the People's House, the White House, using tear gas and flash grenades in order to stage a photo op? A photo of one of the most historic churches in the country, or at least in Washington, D. C. We can be forgiven for believing the president's more interesting in power, then in principle were just serving the passions of his based on the needs of the people in his care, for that's what the presidency is, the duty to care, to care for all of us, not just those who vote for us, but all of us, not just our donors, but all of us. The president held up the Bible at ST John's Church. I just wish he opened it once in a while, said a brandishing. If he opened it, he could have learned something. They're all called love one another as we love ourselves. It's really hard work, but it's the work of America. Donald Trump is interested in doing that work. Instead, he's preening and sweeping away all the guard rails. Lo have protected our democracy guard rails. I helped make possible this nation's path to a more perfect union, a union that constantly requires reform and rededication. And, yes, the protest from voices that are mistreated, ignored, left out or left behind. But it is a union you worth fighting for. That's why I'm running for pressure. In addition of the Bible, the president might also want open the U. S. Constitution. If he did, he'd find a thing called the First Amendment What it says, Beginning says the right of the people peaceably to assemble and to petition their government for redress of grievances. That's kind of an essential motion building into this country, Mr President. That's America. That's America. No horses rising up on their hind legs to push back peaceful protests, not using the American military to move against the American people. This is a nation of values. Our freedom to speak is a cherished knowledge that lives inside every American. Almost from the time your kids we're gonna allow any president to quiet our voice. We won't let those who see this is an opportunity to sow chaos. Throw up a smokescreen to distract us and very really religion legitimate grievances. At the heart of these protests, we can We can't leave this moment. I can't leave this moment thinking that we can once again turn away and do nothing. Can't do that this time. We just can't. The moment has come for our nation to deal with systemic graces to deal with the growing economic inequity that exists in our nation to deal with the denial of the promise of this nation made to so many. No, I've said from the outset of this election that were in the battle for the soul of this nation. We are in the battle for the soul of a nation. What we believe, maybe most importantly, who we want to be. It's all steak that's sure today than it's ever been leased in my lifetime. And it's this urgent. It's in the services we can find a path forward. Now the history of this nation teaches us that is some of our darkest moments of despair. We've made some of our greatest progress somewhere. Darkest moment. 13 14 15th Amendments follow the Civil War The greatest economic growth in world history grew out of the Great Depression. Civil Rights Act of 1964 and 65. Voting Rights Act of 65 came in the tracks of Bull Connor's vicious dogs. Prior phrase Reverend Barber. It's the morning we find hope. It's in the morning. We find hope when we more it's gonna take more than talk. Had talked before, read protest before we've got a now vowed to make this at least in their of action and reverse the systemic racism with a long overdue concrete changes. The action will not be completed in the 1st 100 days of my presidency. If I'm fortunate to be elected or even in my entire term, it's gonna take the work of a generation. But if this agenda will take time to complete, it should not wait for the 1st 100 days of my presidency to get started. A down payment, What is long overdue should come now should come immediately. I call in the Congress to act this month on measures that would be the first step in this direction, starting with real police reform. Congressman Jeffries has a bill to outlaw. Joe calls. Congress should put it on the president's desk in the next few days. The other measures to stop transferring weapons of war to police forces improve oversight and accountability to create a model use of force standard that also should be made long this month. No more excuses, no delays. If Mitch McConnell can bring in the United States Senate to confirm Trump's on qualified judicial nominees who will run roughshod over our constitution now it's time to pass legislation will give true meaning to our constitutional promise of equal protection under the law. Looking ahead, in the 1st 100 days of my presidency, I've committed to creating a national police oversight Commission. I've long believed we need riel community policing. We need each and every police Department of Country to understand a comprehensive review of the undertaking conference review of their hiring, their training de escalation. Some have already done it somehow are in the process of doing it. The federal government should give give the cities and states the tools and the resources they need to implement reforms. More police officers meet the higher standards of the procession. Most of them do it all. The more reason why bad cops should be dealt with severely and swiftly. We all need to take a hard look at the culture allows for the senseless tragedies to keep happening. We need to learn from the cities in the precincts that are getting it right. We know though we have in order to have true American justice, we need economic justice as well. Here, too, is there's much to be done. As a media step. Congress should act should act now to rectify racial inequities that allow Cove in 19 recovery funds to be diverted from where they live. I'll be setting forth my Jenna and economic justice and opportunity in the weeks and months ahead. But it begins with health care. Health care should be a right, not a privilege of the quickest route to universal coverage of this country's expand on Obama care. We could do it. We should do it. But this president, even now in the midst of a public health crisis with massive unemployment, well want to destroy it. He doesn't care how many millions Americans will be hurt because he's consumed with his blind. Any go when it comes to Barack Obama. President Obama. The presidency would draw his lawsuit to strike down Obamacare, and the Congress should prepare to pass the act. I proposed to expand Obama care to millions Mawr. So everyone's covered his last words. We've seen America's true heroes health care workers, docks, nurses, delivery truck drivers, grocery store workers. You know, we've come up with new phrase from essential workers. Essential worker way need to do more than praise them. We need to pay them. We need to pay them because we weren't clear before. It's clear now. This country wasn't built by Wall Street bankers and CEOs was built by the great American middle class, which is built by unions and are essential workers. You know, I know there's enormous fear and uncertainty and anger in the country. I understand. I know so many Americans are suffering, suffering, loss of a loved one.

The bishop who oversees St. John's is among the critics. ""He used violent means to ask to be escorted across the park into the courtyard of the church,"" Bishop Mariann Edgar Budde of the Episcopal Diocese of Washington tells NPR's Morning Edition. ""He held up his Bible after speaking [an] inflammatory militarized approach to the wounds of our nation."" ""He did not pray,"" the bishop continued. ""He did not offer a word of balm or condolence to those who are grieving. He did not seek to unify the country, but rather he used our symbols and our sacred space as a way to reinforce a message that is antithetical to everything that the person of Jesus, whom we follow, and the gospel texts that we strive to emulate ... represent."" Every president since James Madison has visited St. John's Church, which opened in 1816 and sits across the park from the White House. Despite that longstanding relationship, Budde says her diocese had no warning of Monday's visit. ""There was no reaching out, no sense that it would require some sort of authorization before using the church as a backdrop in that way,"" Budde told NPR's Tom Gjelten hours after the incident. The president had used the Bible, and her church, as a prop, she said. ""I was outraged that he felt that he had the license to do that, and that he would abuse our sacred symbols and our sacred space in that way,"" the bishop told Gjelten. Within hours, the White House had assembled footage of the brief outing into a triumphant video that shows the president pumping his fist as he strides past a row of riot police, culminating in him standing in front of the church. Set to swelling orchestral music, the video shows nearly no sign of the destruction and debris that days of intense protests have wrought near the White House. The president, accompanied by his daughter Ivanka, several Cabinet members and Secret Service agents, walked to St. John's a few minutes after Washington's just-installed 7 p.m. curfew began. The federal force used against the demonstrators nearly 30 minutes before the curfew began incensed Mayor Muriel Bowser. ""Shameful!"" Bowser said via Twitter, saying that after ""federal police used munitions on peaceful protestors in front of the White House,"" the city's police force's job of keeping the peace would be made more difficult. I imposed a curfew at 7pm. A full 25 minutes before the curfew & w/o provocation, federal police used munitions on peaceful protestors in front of the White House, an act that will make the job of @DCPoliceDept officers more difficult. Shameful!  DC residents — Go home. Be safe — Muriel Bowser #StayHomeDC at 11 pm (@MurielBowser) June 2, 2020 When the federal force rushed at protesters outside the White House, journalists were also pushed out. Officers attacked Australian reporter Amelia Brace and also hit cameraman Tim Myers, prompting Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison to call for an investigation. The scene played out on live TV, during Australia's breakfast-time Sunrise show. ""While live on air, Myers was struck in the chest by a riot shield and Brace was clubbed with a police baton,"" Australia's 7NEWS reports. ""Our Ambassador should be certainly making representations on behalf of these Australians who effectively been assaulted...for doing their job"" - Leader of the @AustralianLabor Party @AlboMP speaking after @Channel7 journalist & cameraman were hit. https://t.co/rCG56KbYRw #7NEWS pic.twitter.com/CUslYLfYes — 7NEWS Sydney (@7NewsSydney) June 2, 2020 Brace tells Australia's ABC that she repeatedly identified herself as a journalist as officers quickly closed in on them during the rush to clear a path for Trump. ""Despite that as I ran away, clearly stating that we were media, with my cameraman with a camera on his shoulders, I was hit across the back with the baton,"" she says. ""We were then fired upon by the National Guard with those rubber bullets, who are the exact people I had shown my media pass to ... and then we ended up getting tear-gassed."" The situation, she said, was ""absolutely terrifying."" ""I also managed to get a rubber bullet to the backside, and Tim got one in the back of the neck, so we'll have a few bruises tomorrow — but we're feeling perfectly safe,"" Brace says. Shock and anger over the incident led U.S. Ambassador to Australia Arthur B. Culvahouse Jr. to issue a statement saying, ""Freedom of the press is a right Australians and Americans hold dear. We take mistreatment of journalists seriously, as do all who take democracy seriously."" Trump's use of force to allow him to walk across the park has also prompted Arlington County, Va., to pull its police officers out of the nation's capital. The county had sent a police contingent to help keep peace in Washington. But it says the officers were put in a dangerous position that exposed them and others to risk ""for a purpose not worthy of our mutual aid obligations."" ""All ACPD officers left the District of Columbia at 8:30 p.m. Monday,"" Arlington County says. The church has suffered damage during the unrest in Washington against police violence, including a fire that was lit in its basement. While Budde is thankful to first responders who put out that fire, she says she wants the focus remain on the death of George Floyd and others who have died at the hands of police. ""I want to acknowledge the loss of property, but in no way equate it with the loss of life,"" she said. ""I want to be a church that stands in solidarity with those who are making peaceful protest."" : 6/02/20 An earlier version of this Web story mistakenly said that President Trump walked to St. John's Church nearly 30 minutes before Washington's 7 p.m. curfew began.

DENVER — A Denver police officer was fired Tuesday for posting a photo this weekend of himself and two other officers in tactical gear with the caption “Let’s start a riot” in the middle of demonstrations over the killing of George Floyd. Officer Thomas McClay was terminated just a day after an internal affairs investigation was launched for violating the department’s social media policy which bars officers from making posts that could impair the department’s “working relationships” or the performance of their duties. McClay, who joined the department in October after graduating from the department’s academy, could not be immediately reached for comment. He did not have a listed telephone number and the Instagram account he posted on appeared to be deleted. The move came as hundreds of people gathered for another round of protests near the state Capitol and the call for police reform shifted in part to proposed changes in the law. Flanked by families of African American men who died in police custody or shootings in Colorado, State Rep. Leslie Herod and Senate Majority Leroy Garcia announced they were introducing a bill to remove police officers’ immunity from prosecution. Meanwhile, the County Sheriffs of Colorado, the Colorado Fraternal Order of Police and the Colorado Association of Chiefs of Police asked state lawmakers to make it a crime when officers fail to intervene in cases of excessive force. They said that is already an expectation for most law enforcement agencies in the state but putting it into law would allow officers who fail to step in to face criminal prosecution. Buses and trains began running again in downtown Denver on Tuesday for the first time since the protests began on Thursday because there were fewer protests being held. Most days have seen several waves of protests throughout the day, with largely peaceful demonstrations during the day and more unruly protests at night.",0.0

James Manni said. “These were not protesters.

THERE’S NOTHING Advertisement Death toll grows in national protests Share Shares Copy Link Copy Amid protests seeking justice for a black man killed after a white police officer pressed his knee into his neck, several people have lost their lives. They include a well-known and popular owner of a barbecue spot in Louisville, Kentucky and a federal officer working security at a courthouse in Oakland. Many of these deaths have gone unnoticed, overshadowed by the turmoil roiling American cities.One man was the beloved owner of a Louisville barbecue restaurant who made sure to provide free meals to officers. Another was a man known as ""Mr. Indianapolis,"" a former star football player. Yet another was a federal officer working security during a protest.They are among the people who have been killed as protests roiled American cities in the week since 46-year-old George Floyd died when a white officer jammed his knee into the back of the black man's neck. The deaths have at times been overshadowed by the shocking images of chaos engulfing cities across America, from heavy-handed riot police tactics to violence, vandalism and arson. Tens of thousands have marched peacefully in demonstrations against police brutality and racism.Many of the people killed were African Americans, compounding the tragedy for black families to lose more members of their community amid the unrest.Dozens more have been hurt in various altercations — vehicles plowing into crowds, police officers suffering head injuries and broken bones and protesters ending up in emergency rooms with a variety of injuries from the melees.The death toll and circumstances surrounding the killings are still being sorted out in many cities, but here is what we know about the cases so far:LOUISVILLEAs local police and the National Guard sought to disperse a crowd early Monday, they heard gunshots and returned fire, killing the owner of a barbecue restaurant, David McAtee. The mayor has since terminated the city's police chief after finding out that officers on the scene did not activate their body cameras. The state police and the U.S. attorney also are investigating.The 53-year-old McAtee was an African American man known for offering free meals to officers who stopped by.""We lost a wonderful citizen named David McAtee,"" Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer said. ""David was a friend to many, a well-known Barbecue man.""The protests in Louisville have centered not just on Floyd's killing but also the death of Breonna Taylor, a black woman killed in her home in Louisville in March. The 26-year-old EMT was shot eight times by narcotics detectives who knocked down her front door as they attempted to enforce a search warrant. No drugs were found in the home.___OAKLANDA federal law enforcement officer was providing security at the federal courthouse in Oakland during a protest when someone fired shots from a vehicle.Dave Patrick Underwood, 53, died and another officer was critically injured in the shooting. It was not immediately clear if the drive-by shooting was related to the protests, though the federal building's glass doors were smashed and the front entrance was sprayed with anti-police graffiti.Underwood, who was black, and the other officer were contracted security officers and employed by the Department of Homeland Security's Federal Protective Service; they were monitoring a nearby protest. No one has been arrested and a motive for the shooting has not yet been determined. Underwood was the brother of Angela Underwood Jacobs, recently a Republican candidate to fill a vacant U.S. congressional district north of Los Angeles. ___INDIANAPOLISTwo people were killed over the weekend amid unrest in Indianapolis, including 38-year-old Chris Beaty, a former offensive lineman for Indiana University.Beaty was known as ""Mr. Indianapolis"" and remained involved with the Hoosiers long after his graduation. He also was a prominent businessman in the city and ran multiple nightclubs.""I am at a loss for words. The news of the passing of Chris Beaty is just devastating,"" coach Tom Allen said in a statement. ""Since I returned home to coach at Indiana, Chris embraced me, encouraged me and supported me! His passion for life and Indiana Football energized me every time we were together.""The circumstances of his shooting weren't immediately clear but some media reports said it happened near an apartment where he lived. It also occurred the same night that an 18-year-old man also was fatally shot as protests broke out in the city.___MINNEAPOLISIn what is believed to be the first killing since the protests broke out, a 43-year-old black man was fatally shot outside a pawn shop as rioting broke out last week in Minneapolis and then spread nationally.The owner of the pawn shop, who is white, was arrested in the death of Calvin L. Horton Jr. Police say they are investigating the circumstances surrounding the killing, including whether it was related to protests in the neighborhood.The shop was described as having been significantly damaged during unrest. ___OMAHA, NEBRASKAA 22-year-old black man was killed after authorities said he tussled with the owner of two bars in downtown Omaha. Surveillance video of the strip of bars shows a group of people, including James Scurlock, approach bar owner Jake Gardner.Two people are seen on the video tackling Gardner, who ended up on his back and fired shots in the air. Seconds later, Scurlock is seen tackling Gardner, who then fires the gun over his shoulder, striking Scurlock.Authorities have declined to press charges, calling the shooting self-defense.___DETROITA 21-year-old man was killed in downtown Detroit after someone fired shots into a vehicle during a protest. According to a police report, the man was sitting in the driver's seat of a car in a parking lot with two others when someone fired shots into the vehicle and then fled on foot.___CHICAGO SUBURBTwo people were killed during unrest Monday in the Chicago suburb of Cicero, according to a town official.

You say you're against police brutality; will you do something humble and kneel with us?' and I said, 'Absolutely,' and I did and several of my officers joined me,"" Isaac said.Isaac spoke during a briefing Monday on the protests over the weekend, saying he and none of his staff believe what took place in Minneapolis was right and know law enforcement is more professional than that.""We have to move past this and those that have not made those necessary changes, they need to do that as well.

I understand that people are angry if we're not going to talk what's going to happen then, is this going to go on indefinitely.

The protesters had gathered in the park on a sunny evening Monday following the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis a week earlier. The police fired tear gas and rubber bullets and deployed flash bangs. As police directly confronted the protesters, many held up their hands, saying, “Don’t shoot.” In his speech, Trump declared himself “the president of law and order,” and he threatened to deploy the U.S. military unless states halt violent protests. As an additional show of force, he announced he was deploying even more of the military to Washington, giving it the feel of an armed, locked-down city after days of unrest. Afterward, Trump strolled out of the White House gates — something he had never done before — and walked across the cleared Lafayette Park to make a surprise visit to St. John’s Church.

LAS CRUCES - About 300 people gathered Monday night at the lawn in front of Branigan Memorial Library, for a vigil to honor Minnesota man George Floyd, who was killed by police last week. Protesters carried signs that read, ""Police are the Real Virus,"" ""Enough is Enough,"" and ""Black Lives Matter,"" chanted, ""no justice, no peace,"" and the name ""George Floyd,"" and raised fists in the air. Cheers erupted through the crowd as vehicles and even a semi-truck passed by blaring their horns, seemingly in support of the movement. Stay informed. Sign up for a subscription to the Sun-News. On May 25, Floyd became the latest unarmed black person to die at the hands of a law enforcement officer when former police officer Derek Chauvin knelt on his neck for almost nine minutes despite Floyd's plea that he couldn't breathe. The vigil took place around the statue of Albert Johnson, who became the first black mayor of Las Cruces in 1976. A sign that read, ""Rest in Power George Floyd,"" was taped to the base of the statue. As night fell, vigil attendees lit candles.

All who spoke at the Monday vigil implored attendees to keep it peaceful. In contrast to many cities in the US, the protests in southern New Mexico's largest city have been relatively quiet. There have been no marches, clashes with police or violent civil unrest. In a statement to the Sun-News, Dan Trujillo, spokesperson for the Las Cruces Police Department, said Las Cruces protesters shouldn't feel frightened or threatened. ""We, as a police department, have the responsibility to protect everyone's right to peacefully assemble and exercise their First Amendment rights. That said, we also ask for the public's help in identifying suspicious individuals or groups that wish to cause harm on our community,"" Trujillo said.

Michelle Lujan Grisham on Monday issued the following statement: “I want to wholeheartedly commend the thousands of New Mexicans who peacefully protested in Albuquerque last night. Freedom of speech is an undeniable right of every American and every New Mexican, and in moments of crisis, in expressing anger at long-standing injustice and racism, that right is all the more important. These protesters were part of an exemplary demonstration. “Later in the night, a small group took a wrong turn, and this is greatly concerning. We have received reports of shots fired at or in the direction of public safety officers – and this is flatly unacceptable. That sort of behavior is an attempt to distort the important work of the peaceful protesters – who have every right to demonstrate in peace – and puts both the protesters and public safety officers at risk. Those individuals, I have complete confidence, will be held accountable. There is no place in this moment for hijacking the protesters’ message of justice and non-violence. “The president’s comments this morning were a dangerous step in this wrong direction. His effort to militarize the response to these protests will only serve to inflame the feelings of anger and injustice – and will give rise to additional opportunity for violence and chaos. I unequivocally reject his notion that physical or military force is the only worthwhile or effective response to these protests. “The state of New Mexico will stand ready to assist local governments in facilitating peaceful protests. These protesters are giving voice to powerful and deep feelings about the unacceptable inequity and injustice woven into this country; their stand against racism is a worthy one; and I encourage them to continue demonstrating in a peaceful and safe fashion, remembering the urgent health risks of this moment. Lastly it is essential that I underscore the importance of not allowing that message to be distorted by the harmful actions of a few bad actors.”",0.0

(KRQE) – Black Lives Matter protestors took to the Albuquerque streets again Monday night to protest the killing of Minneapolis man George Floyd. The rain did not stop protestors Monday night and parts of Central near Nob Hill were blocked off so they could march in the streets. Hundreds of people showed up around the University of New Mexico area, protesting police brutality against African Americans after a Minneapolis man George Floyd died one week ago in police custody. “I think it’s always important to support what needs to be supported you know, it’s been too long that this is just continuously happening and people are tired of it. And I think that this is just another way to show support, this is another way to get out here as a community and just to be together and know that we don’t stand for this, like this is not okay, this was not going to be okay. It never was okay. and we got to make a stand and we got to stop it now,” said one protester. Protestors Monday night demanded change within law enforcement, especially in confrontations with people of color. One protestor KRQE News 13 talked to says its important for people of all races to come together at this time and show support. “I think especially as white activists we all need to stand up for our black brothers and sisters. I think that you know they have stood up for us for so many things and this is the only way we can repay it is to be out here showing your faces, like having signs showing support. You know everyone here is trying to stay as peaceful as we can and supportive and I don’t know, it’s just the right thing to do,” said a protestor. Despite near-constant rain, the group marched from Nob Hill to the University of New Mexico and continued marching around the campus. It was mostly a peaceful night and protesters say they want these demonstrations to remain peaceful so their message can get across. Related Coverage:",0.0

Las Cruces Sun-News LAS CRUCES - On Sunday a group of about 30 people gathered on the lawn of the Branigan Memorial Library in Las Cruces to mourn the death of Minneapolis man George Floyd and to raise awareness about racism in the United States. The vigil was organized by Kimberly York, second vice president of the Doña Ana County NAACP, who is also on the executive committee of Michelle Lujan Grisham's Office of African American Affairs, and Patrick Turner, a researcher at New Mexico State University. They'll be hosting a second vigil beginning at 7 p.m. Tuesday on the downtown plaza. Stay informed. Sign up for a subscription to the Sun-News. There was also a vigil planned to begin at 5 p.m. Monday in front of the library. During the day Monday, dozens of protesters in front of the library held signs and spoke out to passersby, attempting to raise awareness about police brutality and racism. Floyd, who is black, was killed in Minneapolis on May 25 when white police officer Derek Chauvin knelt on his neck for close to nine minutes, while Floyd repeatedly told him that he couldn't breathe. On Friday, Chauvin was charged with one count of third-degree murder, and one count of manslaughter and is facing up to 35 years in prison if convicted of both crimes, and a $20,000 fine if convicted of the manslaughter charge. Since his homicide, protests and riots have occurred in cities across the nation. Clashes between protesters and police happened in El Paso and Albuquerque on Sunday night. In contrast, Las Cruces protests have been calm and mostly concentrated in front of the library, at the corner of Main Street and Picacho Ave. Getting out to vote Though demonstrating can accomplish much, York said the other part of the NAACP strategy to enact change is to encourage voting. She said there'd be a chance for attendees of Tuesday's vigil to register to vote. It'll be too late to vote in New Mexico primary election, which is Tuesday, but residents can register to vote in the general election on Nov. 3. ""Our lives depend on it,"" she said. ""We have to do our civic duty and we have to make sure that we are not only staying involved at this level but when there are opportunities to speak out that we feel empowered to be able to do so."" A clinical therapist, York said between the COVID-19 emergency and Floyd's death, she has seen a 75 percent increase in her practices in both Las Cruces and Cleveland, Ohio. Attendees at Sunday's vigil and Monday's protest had much to say about the current state of race affairs and police actions in America. Here's some of what they told the Sun-News. For their children On Sunday, Christopher Brooks, president of the New Mexico State University Black Student Association, said he attended in part because of his children. ""Just really step up to show America, to show our neighborhoods, to show our communities what America is all about. This, what we're seeing right now, is not the America I want my sons and daughters to grow up in. This isn't what I want them to see. We're so much better than that,"" he said. Buy Photo Diamond Williams holds a candle as her mother Jasmine Williams lights it at a vigil to remember George Floyd, during a vigil Sunday, May 31, 2020, at Branigan Memorial Library. (Photo: Bethany Freudenthal/Sun-News) A mother of two, Jasmine Williams said she's had a difficult time explaining to her children that Floyd's race likely played a part in why he was killed. She has two daughters, who are black, and she wants to teach them that they are beautiful. ""I need them to understand that they need to fight and understand and feel beautiful for who they are and not based off of what somebody tells them to be beautiful, and what somebody tells them they need to look like or how they need to behave,"" she said Sunday during the vigil. Williams said she experiences racism every day of her life. Speak up Ignacio Alvarado, who is dark-skinned, said he was 12 years old and on a road trip with his family when he was called the ""N"" word. He's now 19 and was attending Monday's protest to highlight racial injustices happening in the United States ""Society has basically brainwashed people into thinking that African Americans and people of color are dangerous by nature and they don't take the time to realize we're people ourselves. We're not a threat to anyone. We're trying to go about our lives, our own responsibilities and our own worries,"" he said. When Alvarado saw the video of Floyd's death, he said it was tragic. ""But personally I'm used to seeing African American males pinned down in the street, murdered,"" he said. More: Doña Ana County NAACP president: I can't breathe either Karra Trout, 17, said it enrages her when she sees black men and women victimized by law enforcement. ""Police are killing black people based on the color of their skin. It happens all over the country and nobody is doing anything about it,"" she said. Trout said racism isn't a big issue in Las Cruces. But protests. like the one Monday, are important to inform the community of what's happening nationwide, she said. Arizona State University journalism student Erin Galindo, who grew up in Las Cruces said she felt it was important to attend the protest as a person of color. ""Standing with a community of people who are being murdered because of the color of their skin, that shouldn't be objective. That's just wrong to stay silent at a time like this,"" she said. A cycle that has to end Brother Caleb Oeming, a friar at the Franciscan Community of Mercy at Holy American National Catholic Church, said he felt it was his duty to attend the protest Monday. ""If I'm going to say that I support and that I follow Jesus Christ who fought for justice and stood up for justice, and I turn a blind eye because I'm comfortable and look like the in-group, I'm a hypocrite,"" he said. More: Oeming said police brutality against black people is a cycle that has to end. ""What happened most recently in Minneapolis, this is horrific and this is ongoing, over and over again. I feel like people aren't seeing the disparity that's happening. We teach love and forgiveness and at the same turn around and allow this to happen,"" he said.

Teoh. All the elected officials that air here bring ingredients. I can't breathe. I can't breathe. George floors last words, but they didn't die with him. You're still being heard going all across this nation. They speak to a nation where too often, just the color of your skin put your life at risk. They speak to the nation were more than 100,000 people have lost their lives a virus and 40 million have filed for unemployment. With the disproportionate number of those deaths and job losses concentrated black and brown communities, they speak to a nation where every day millions of people and millions not at the moment of losing their life but in the course of living their life are saying to themselves, I can't breathe. It's a wake up call to our nation. In my view, it's for all of us, and I mean all of us. It's not the first time we've heard those words. They're the same words we heard from Eric Garner when his life was taken away six years ago. But it's time to listen to those words, to try to understand, to respond to him respond with action. A country is crying out for leadership leadership that can you. Nine US leadership That brings us together. Leadership that could recognize pain and deep grief of communities that have had a knee on the neck for a long time. There's no place for violence, no place for looting or destroying property or burning churches. There's during businesses. Many have been built by the very people of color who are first time in their lives, are beginning to realize their dreams and bill wealth for their families. Nor is it acceptable for police sworn to protect and serve all people escalate tension, resort to excessive violence, way need to distinguish between legitimate peaceful protests and opportunistic, violent destruction. We have to be vigilant about the violence that's being done by this incumbent president, to our economy and to the pursuit of justice. Would peaceful protesters dispersed in order for a president, a president from the doorstep of the People's House, the White House, using tear gas and flash grenades in order to stage a photo op? A photo of one of the most historic churches in the country, or at least in Washington, D. C. We can be forgiven for believing the president's more interesting in power, then in principle were just serving the passions of his based on the needs of the people in his care, for that's what the presidency is, the duty to care, to care for all of us, not just those who vote for us, but all of us, not just our donors, but all of us. The president held up the Bible at ST John's Church. I just wish he opened it once in a while, said a brandishing. If he opened it, he could have learned something. They're all called love one another as we love ourselves. It's really hard work, but it's the work of America. Donald Trump is interested in doing that work. Instead, he's preening and sweeping away all the guard rails. Lo have protected our democracy guard rails. I helped make possible this nation's path to a more perfect union, a union that constantly requires reform and rededication. And, yes, the protest from voices that are mistreated, ignored, left out or left behind. But it is a union you worth fighting for. That's why I'm running for pressure. In addition of the Bible, the president might also want open the U. S. Constitution. If he did, he'd find a thing called the First Amendment What it says, Beginning says the right of the people peaceably to assemble and to petition their government for redress of grievances. That's kind of an essential motion building into this country, Mr President. That's America. That's America. No horses rising up on their hind legs to push back peaceful protests, not using the American military to move against the American people. This is a nation of values. Our freedom to speak is a cherished knowledge that lives inside every American. Almost from the time your kids we're gonna allow any president to quiet our voice. We won't let those who see this is an opportunity to sow chaos. Throw up a smokescreen to distract us and very really religion legitimate grievances. At the heart of these protests, we can We can't leave this moment. I can't leave this moment thinking that we can once again turn away and do nothing. Can't do that this time. We just can't. The moment has come for our nation to deal with systemic graces to deal with the growing economic inequity that exists in our nation to deal with the denial of the promise of this nation made to so many. No, I've said from the outset of this election that were in the battle for the soul of this nation. We are in the battle for the soul of a nation. What we believe, maybe most importantly, who we want to be. It's all steak that's sure today than it's ever been leased in my lifetime. And it's this urgent. It's in the services we can find a path forward. Now the history of this nation teaches us that is some of our darkest moments of despair. We've made some of our greatest progress somewhere. Darkest moment. 13 14 15th Amendments follow the Civil War The greatest economic growth in world history grew out of the Great Depression. Civil Rights Act of 1964 and 65. Voting Rights Act of 65 came in the tracks of Bull Connor's vicious dogs. Prior phrase Reverend Barber. It's the morning we find hope. It's in the morning. We find hope when we more it's gonna take more than talk. Had talked before, read protest before we've got a now vowed to make this at least in their of action and reverse the systemic racism with a long overdue concrete changes. The action will not be completed in the 1st 100 days of my presidency. If I'm fortunate to be elected or even in my entire term, it's gonna take the work of a generation. But if this agenda will take time to complete, it should not wait for the 1st 100 days of my presidency to get started. A down payment, What is long overdue should come now should come immediately. I call in the Congress to act this month on measures that would be the first step in this direction, starting with real police reform. Congressman Jeffries has a bill to outlaw. Joe calls. Congress should put it on the president's desk in the next few days. The other measures to stop transferring weapons of war to police forces improve oversight and accountability to create a model use of force standard that also should be made long this month. No more excuses, no delays. If Mitch McConnell can bring in the United States Senate to confirm Trump's on qualified judicial nominees who will run roughshod over our constitution now it's time to pass legislation will give true meaning to our constitutional promise of equal protection under the law. Looking ahead, in the 1st 100 days of my presidency, I've committed to creating a national police oversight Commission. I've long believed we need riel community policing. We need each and every police Department of Country to understand a comprehensive review of the undertaking conference review of their hiring, their training de escalation. Some have already done it somehow are in the process of doing it. The federal government should give give the cities and states the tools and the resources they need to implement reforms. More police officers meet the higher standards of the procession. Most of them do it all. The more reason why bad cops should be dealt with severely and swiftly. We all need to take a hard look at the culture allows for the senseless tragedies to keep happening. We need to learn from the cities in the precincts that are getting it right. We know though we have in order to have true American justice, we need economic justice as well. Here, too, is there's much to be done. As a media step. Congress should act should act now to rectify racial inequities that allow Cove in 19 recovery funds to be diverted from where they live. I'll be setting forth my Jenna and economic justice and opportunity in the weeks and months ahead. But it begins with health care. Health care should be a right, not a privilege of the quickest route to universal coverage of this country's expand on Obama care. We could do it. We should do it. But this president, even now in the midst of a public health crisis with massive unemployment, well want to destroy it. He doesn't care how many millions Americans will be hurt because he's consumed with his blind. Any go when it comes to Barack Obama. President Obama. The presidency would draw his lawsuit to strike down Obamacare, and the Congress should prepare to pass the act. I proposed to expand Obama care to millions Mawr. So everyone's covered his last words. We've seen America's true heroes health care workers, docks, nurses, delivery truck drivers, grocery store workers. You know, we've come up with new phrase from essential workers. Essential worker way need to do more than praise them. We need to pay them. We need to pay them because we weren't clear before. It's clear now. This country wasn't built by Wall Street bankers and CEOs was built by the great American middle class, which is built by unions and are essential workers. You know, I know there's enormous fear and uncertainty and anger in the country. I understand. I know so many Americans are suffering, suffering, loss of a loved one. So for an economic hardship, wondering, can I feed my family tomorrow? What's gonna have suffering under the weight of a generation after generation after generation, I've heard inflicted on people of color black brown in native communities in particular. Like many of you, I know what it means. Degree. My losses are not the same as loss is felt by so many. But I know what it feels like when you think you can't go on. I know what it means to have that black hole in your chest where your grief is being sucked into it. Just a few days ago, mark the fifth anniversary of my son most passing. There are still moments when the pain is so great it feels no different than the day I sat in that bed as he passed away. But I also knew, but the best way to bear loss and pain to turn it into that anger and anguish in the purpose. And Americans know what our purposes is a nation. It has to be guided. Mr. Guided guided us from the very beginning. No, it's been reported the day that President John F. Kennedy was assassinated. Little Yolanda King came home from school in Atlanta and jumped in her daddy's arms, said, Oh, Daddy, she said, Now we're never going to get our freedom. Daddy was reassuring, Strong, brave. He said, No, don't worry, baby. It's gonna be OK. It's gonna be all right. Amid the violence and fear, Dr King persevered. He was driven by his dream of a nation where justice runs down like water and righteousness like a mighty stream. Then 19 68. Hate cut him down in Memphis two days before Dr Key was murdered. Hey gave a final Sunday sermon to Washington. No, he told us that though the arc of the moral universe is long said, it bends towards justice and we know we can bend it because we have. We have to believe that still, that's our purpose. It's been our purpose in the very beginning, to become a nation where all men and women are not only creating, but they're treated equally, not just credited, would treated equally to become a nation to find, in Dr King's words, not only by the absence of tension before the presence of justice, I'm not just a not attention but justice. Today in America, it's hard to keep faith the justices hated. I know that, you know pain is raw, the pain is really president of states must be part of the solution, not the problem. But this president today is part of the problem and accelerates. When you treated the words when the looting starts, the shooting starts. They weren't the words present. Their words of a racist Miami police chief in the sixties when he tweeted the protesters quote, would have been greeted with the most vicious dogs when people would have been really hurt. End of quote. They weren't the words of a president. They were the kind of words Bull Connor would have used, unleashing his dogs on innocent women and Children. You know, the American story is a story about action and reaction that's actually works. We can't be naive about it. I wish I could say that Hate began with Donald Trump will. And with him it didn't and it won't. American history is in a fairy tale with a guaranteed happy ending. The battle for the soul of this nation has been a constant push and pull for more than 240 years, a tug of war between the American ideal that we're all created equal in the harsh reality that racism has long torn us apart. The honest truth is that both elements are part of the American character, both elements at our best. The American ideal wins out, but it's never around. It's always a fight, and the battle is never fully one. But we can't ignore the truth that we're at our best when we open our hearts rather than clinch our fish. Donald Trump has turned this country in a battlefield driven by old resentments and fresh fears. He thinks division helps him. His narcissism has become more important than the nation's well being that he leads. I ask every American I mean this in the bottom, or ask every American look at where we are now and thinking new. Is this who we are? Is this what we want to be? Is this you want to pass on to our Children and our grandchildren? Fear, anger, finger pointing, rather the pursuit of happiness, incompetence and anxiety, self absorbed selfishness? Or do we want to be the America we know? We can be American. We know in our hearts we could be and should be. Look, I look at the presidency as a very big job and nobody we'll get it right every time. And I won't either. But I promise you this. I won't traffic in fear and division. I won't fan the flames of hate. I'll seek the heal, the racial wounds that have long plagued our country, not used them for political gain. I'll do my job and I will take responsibility. I won't blame others. I'll never forget. I will never forget. I promise you, this job is not about me. It's about you. It's about us work now gone to rebuild the nation, but build it better than it was. We're the only nation of the world that goes through a crisis and comes out better to build a better future That's what America does to build a better future. We build the future. It may in fact, be the most American thing to do. Build the future. We hunger for liberty the way Harriet Tubman and Frederick Douglass did. We thirst for the vote like Susan B. Anthony and Ella Baker and John Lewis. Did we strive to explore the stars, cure disease, make an in perfect union more perfect than has been? We may come up short, but at our best we try. My fellow Americans were facing a formidable enemies. They include not only the Corona virus and the table impact on the lives and livelihoods, but also the selfishness and fear that have loomed over our national life for the last three years. I choose those words advisedly, selfishness and fear. Defeating those enemies requires us to do our duty, and that duty includes remembering who we should be, who we should be. We should be the America of F. D. R. And Eisenhower of Rosa Parks and Martin Luther King Jr. Jonah Salt. Neil Armstrong. We should be the America that cherishes life, liberty and courage, and above all, we should be in America that chairs each other each and every one of us. You know, we're a nation in pain. We must let let our pain destroys. We're nation and raged. We can not our rage consume us. We're a nation. It's exhausted. But we will not allow our exhaustion to fetus as presidents. My commitment to all of you to lead on these issues and to listen because I truly believe in my heart of hearts we can't overcome. We stand together. Finally, is one America. We'll rise stronger than we were before. We'll move that art closer to justice. We'll reach out to one another for speak out for one another. And please, please do what's recently been happening. Take care of one another. This is the United States of America. There's never been anything we've been unable to do when we set our mind to do it. We've done it together together, united. That's we are at our best. God bless you all. May God protect our troops que Mr Mayor. Thanks for hospitality. Teoh. All the elected officials that air here bring ingredients. I can't breathe.

It's in the services we can find a path forward. Now the history of this nation teaches us that is some of our darkest moments of despair. We've made some of our greatest progress somewhere. Darkest moment. 13 14 15th Amendments follow the Civil War The greatest economic growth in world history grew out of the Great Depression. Civil Rights Act of 1964 and 65. Voting Rights Act of 65 came in the tracks of Bull Connor's vicious dogs. Prior phrase Reverend Barber. It's the morning we find hope. It's in the morning. We find hope when we more it's gonna take more than talk. Had talked before, read protest before we've got a now vowed to make this at least in their of action and reverse the systemic racism with a long overdue concrete changes. The action will not be completed in the 1st 100 days of my presidency. If I'm fortunate to be elected or even in my entire term, it's gonna take the work of a generation. But if this agenda will take time to complete, it should not wait for the 1st 100 days of my presidency to get started. A down payment, What is long overdue should come now should come immediately. I call in the Congress to act this month on measures that would be the first step in this direction, starting with real police reform. Congressman Jeffries has a bill to outlaw. Joe calls. Congress should put it on the president's desk in the next few days. The other measures to stop transferring weapons of war to police forces improve oversight and accountability to create a model use of force standard that also should be made long this month. No more excuses, no delays. If Mitch McConnell can bring in the United States Senate to confirm Trump's on qualified judicial nominees who will run roughshod over our constitution now it's time to pass legislation will give true meaning to our constitutional promise of equal protection under the law. Looking ahead, in the 1st 100 days of my presidency, I've committed to creating a national police oversight Commission. I've long believed we need riel community policing. We need each and every police Department of Country to understand a comprehensive review of the undertaking conference review of their hiring, their training de escalation. Some have already done it somehow are in the process of doing it. The federal government should give give the cities and states the tools and the resources they need to implement reforms. More police officers meet the higher standards of the procession. Most of them do it all. The more reason why bad cops should be dealt with severely and swiftly. We all need to take a hard look at the culture allows for the senseless tragedies to keep happening. We need to learn from the cities in the precincts that are getting it right. We know though we have in order to have true American justice, we need economic justice as well. Here, too, is there's much to be done. As a media step. Congress should act should act now to rectify racial inequities that allow Cove in 19 recovery funds to be diverted from where they live. I'll be setting forth my Jenna and economic justice and opportunity in the weeks and months ahead. But it begins with health care. Health care should be a right, not a privilege of the quickest route to universal coverage of this country's expand on Obama care. We could do it. We should do it. But this president, even now in the midst of a public health crisis with massive unemployment, well want to destroy it. He doesn't care how many millions Americans will be hurt because he's consumed with his blind. Any go when it comes to Barack Obama. President Obama. The presidency would draw his lawsuit to strike down Obamacare, and the Congress should prepare to pass the act. I proposed to expand Obama care to millions Mawr. So everyone's covered his last words. We've seen America's true heroes health care workers, docks, nurses, delivery truck drivers, grocery store workers. You know, we've come up with new phrase from essential workers. Essential worker way need to do more than praise them. We need to pay them. We need to pay them because we weren't clear before. It's clear now. This country wasn't built by Wall Street bankers and CEOs was built by the great American middle class, which is built by unions and are essential workers. You know, I know there's enormous fear and uncertainty and anger in the country. I understand. I know so many Americans are suffering, suffering, loss of a loved one. So for an economic hardship, wondering, can I feed my family tomorrow? What's gonna have suffering under the weight of a generation after generation after generation, I've heard inflicted on people of color black brown in native communities in particular. Like many of you, I know what it means. Degree. My losses are not the same as loss is felt by so many. But I know what it feels like when you think you can't go on. I know what it means to have that black hole in your chest where your grief is being sucked into it. Just a few days ago, mark the fifth anniversary of my son most passing. There are still moments when the pain is so great it feels no different than the day I sat in that bed as he passed away. But I also knew, but the best way to bear loss and pain to turn it into that anger and anguish in the purpose. And Americans know what our purposes is a nation. It has to be guided. Mr. Guided guided us from the very beginning. No, it's been reported the day that President John F. Kennedy was assassinated. Little Yolanda King came home from school in Atlanta and jumped in her daddy's arms, said, Oh, Daddy, she said, Now we're never going to get our freedom. Daddy was reassuring, Strong, brave. He said, No, don't worry, baby. It's gonna be OK. It's gonna be all right. Amid the violence and fear, Dr King persevered. He was driven by his dream of a nation where justice runs down like water and righteousness like a mighty stream. Then 19 68. Hate cut him down in Memphis two days before Dr Key was murdered. Hey gave a final Sunday sermon to Washington. No, he told us that though the arc of the moral universe is long said, it bends towards justice and we know we can bend it because we have. We have to believe that still, that's our purpose. It's been our purpose in the very beginning, to become a nation where all men and women are not only creating, but they're treated equally, not just credited, would treated equally to become a nation to find, in Dr King's words, not only by the absence of tension before the presence of justice, I'm not just a not attention but justice. Today in America, it's hard to keep faith the justices hated. I know that, you know pain is raw, the pain is really president of states must be part of the solution, not the problem. But this president today is part of the problem and accelerates. When you treated the words when the looting starts, the shooting starts. They weren't the words present. Their words of a racist Miami police chief in the sixties when he tweeted the protesters quote, would have been greeted with the most vicious dogs when people would have been really hurt. End of quote. They weren't the words of a president. They were the kind of words Bull Connor would have used, unleashing his dogs on innocent women and Children. You know, the American story is a story about action and reaction that's actually works. We can't be naive about it. I wish I could say that Hate began with Donald Trump will. And with him it didn't and it won't. American history is in a fairy tale with a guaranteed happy ending. The battle for the soul of this nation has been a constant push and pull for more than 240 years, a tug of war between the American ideal that we're all created equal in the harsh reality that racism has long torn us apart. The honest truth is that both elements are part of the American character, both elements at our best. The American ideal wins out, but it's never around. It's always a fight, and the battle is never fully one. But we can't ignore the truth that we're at our best when we open our hearts rather than clinch our fish. Donald Trump has turned this country in a battlefield driven by old resentments and fresh fears. He thinks division helps him. His narcissism has become more important than the nation's well being that he leads. I ask every American I mean this in the bottom, or ask every American look at where we are now and thinking new. Is this who we are? Is this what we want to be? Is this you want to pass on to our Children and our grandchildren? Fear, anger, finger pointing, rather the pursuit of happiness, incompetence and anxiety, self absorbed selfishness? Or do we want to be the America we know? We can be American. We know in our hearts we could be and should be. Look, I look at the presidency as a very big job and nobody we'll get it right every time. And I won't either. But I promise you this. I won't traffic in fear and division. I won't fan the flames of hate. I'll seek the heal, the racial wounds that have long plagued our country, not used them for political gain. I'll do my job and I will take responsibility. I won't blame others. I'll never forget. I will never forget. I promise you, this job is not about me. It's about you. It's about us work now gone to rebuild the nation, but build it better than it was. We're the only nation of the world that goes through a crisis and comes out better to build a better future That's what America does to build a better future. We build the future. It may in fact, be the most American thing to do. Build the future. We hunger for liberty the way Harriet Tubman and Frederick Douglass did. We thirst for the vote like Susan B. Anthony and Ella Baker and John Lewis. Did we strive to explore the stars, cure disease, make an in perfect union more perfect than has been? We may come up short, but at our best we try. My fellow Americans were facing a formidable enemies. They include not only the Corona virus and the table impact on the lives and livelihoods, but also the selfishness and fear that have loomed over our national life for the last three years. I choose those words advisedly, selfishness and fear. Defeating those enemies requires us to do our duty, and that duty includes remembering who we should be, who we should be. We should be the America of F. D. R. And Eisenhower of Rosa Parks and Martin Luther King Jr. Jonah Salt. Neil Armstrong. We should be the America that cherishes life, liberty and courage, and above all, we should be in America that chairs each other each and every one of us. You know, we're a nation in pain. We must let let our pain destroys. We're nation and raged. We can not our rage consume us. We're a nation. It's exhausted. But we will not allow our exhaustion to fetus as presidents. My commitment to all of you to lead on these issues and to listen because I truly believe in my heart of hearts we can't overcome. We stand together. Finally, is one America. We'll rise stronger than we were before. We'll move that art closer to justice. We'll reach out to one another for speak out for one another. And please, please do what's recently been happening. Take care of one another. This is the United States of America. There's never been anything we've been unable to do when we set our mind to do it. We've done it together together, united. That's we are at our best. God bless you all. May God protect our troops que",0.0

David McAtee was shot and killed by law enforcement as they broke up a crowd early Monday morning in Louisville, officials said.Steve Conrad, who was Louisville Metro Police Department's chief at the time, went to the scene shortly after it happened to give details. He said the incident happened around 12:15 a.m. in the parking lot of Dino's Food Mart, located at 26th and Broadway.McAtee owned a restaurant nearby called Yaya's BBQ.Mayor Greg Fischer called McAtee a wonderful citizen, and said many knew him as ""the BBQ man.""Conrad said LMPD and the National Guard were breaking up a large group at that location when someone fired at them. Law enforcement then returned fire, police said. Police said they have several persons of interest being interviewed and it is still unclear who fired the first shot and who struck McAtee.“It’s very clear that many people do not trust the police. That is an issue we’re going to work on and work through,"" Conrad said during an early morning news conference.Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear held a news conference around noon saying to his understanding, there was significant footage of what happened, including from body cameras. He called on all of it to be released quickly.“I’m not asking people to trust our account (of what happened). I want to see the video for ourselves,” Beshear said.It was later learned that none of the LMPD officers present had their cameras activated. Two LMPD officers on the scene who police confirm were involved, Kate Crews and Allen Austin, have been put on administrative leave.The governor said he has heard the crowd at that food mart was not demonstrating at the time, but police responded because they were violating curfew.A curfew went into effect Sunday night at 9 p.m. for the whole city. That curfew has since been extended through June 8.It was an attempt by the mayor to settle unrest that has gone on for several days in the city over the Breonna Taylor case and other cases causing protests and riots across the country.Beshear also had Taylor's mother speak Monday, during which she said, ""We can't get justice with violence.""Seven people were shot the first day of protests in Louisville.

The bishop who oversees St. John's is among the critics. ""He used violent means to ask to be escorted across the park into the courtyard of the church,"" Bishop Mariann Edgar Budde of the Episcopal Diocese of Washington tells NPR's Morning Edition. ""He held up his Bible after speaking [an] inflammatory militarized approach to the wounds of our nation."" ""He did not pray,"" the bishop continued. ""He did not offer a word of balm or condolence to those who are grieving. He did not seek to unify the country, but rather he used our symbols and our sacred space as a way to reinforce a message that is antithetical to everything that the person of Jesus, whom we follow, and the gospel texts that we strive to emulate ... represent."" Every president since James Madison has visited St. John's Church, which opened in 1816 and sits across the park from the White House. Despite that longstanding relationship, Budde says her diocese had no warning of Monday's visit. ""There was no reaching out, no sense that it would require some sort of authorization before using the church as a backdrop in that way,"" Budde told NPR's Tom Gjelten hours after the incident. The president had used the Bible, and her church, as a prop, she said. ""I was outraged that he felt that he had the license to do that, and that he would abuse our sacred symbols and our sacred space in that way,"" the bishop told Gjelten. Within hours, the White House had assembled footage of the brief outing into a triumphant video that shows the president pumping his fist as he strides past a row of riot police, culminating in him standing in front of the church. Set to swelling orchestral music, the video shows nearly no sign of the destruction and debris that days of intense protests have wrought near the White House. The president, accompanied by his daughter Ivanka, several Cabinet members and Secret Service agents, walked to St. John's a few minutes after Washington's just-installed 7 p.m. curfew began. The federal force used against the demonstrators nearly 30 minutes before the curfew began incensed Mayor Muriel Bowser. ""Shameful!"" Bowser said via Twitter, saying that after ""federal police used munitions on peaceful protestors in front of the White House,"" the city's police force's job of keeping the peace would be made more difficult. I imposed a curfew at 7pm. A full 25 minutes before the curfew & w/o provocation, federal police used munitions on peaceful protestors in front of the White House, an act that will make the job of @DCPoliceDept officers more difficult. Shameful!  DC residents — Go home. Be safe — Muriel Bowser (@MurielBowser) June 2, 2020 When the federal force rushed at protesters outside the White House, journalists were also pushed out. Officers attacked Australian reporter Amelia Brace and also hit cameraman Tim Myers, prompting Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison to call for an investigation. The scene played out on live TV, during Australia's breakfast-time Sunrise show. ""While live on air, Myers was struck in the chest by a riot shield and Brace was clubbed with a police baton,"" Australia's 7NEWS reports. ""Our Ambassador should be certainly making representations on behalf of these Australians who effectively been assaulted...for doing their job"" - Leader of the @AustralianLabor Party @AlboMP speaking after @Channel7 journalist & cameraman were hit. https://t.co/rCG56KbYRw #7NEWS pic.twitter.com/CUslYLfYes — 7NEWS Sydney (@7NewsSydney) June 2, 2020 Brace tells Australia's ABC that she repeatedly identified herself as a journalist as officers quickly closed in on them during the rush to clear a path for Trump. ""Despite that as I ran away, clearly stating that we were media, with my cameraman with a camera on his shoulders, I was hit across the back with the baton,"" she says. ""We were then fired upon by the National Guard with those rubber bullets, who are the exact people I had shown my media pass to ... and then we ended up getting tear-gassed."" The situation, she said, was ""absolutely terrifying."" ""I also managed to get a rubber bullet to the backside, and Tim got one in the back of the neck, so we'll have a few bruises tomorrow — but we're feeling perfectly safe,"" Brace says. Shock and anger over the incident led U.S. Ambassador to Australia Arthur B. Culvahouse Jr. to issue a statement saying, ""Freedom of the press is a right Australians and Americans hold dear. We take mistreatment of journalists seriously, as do all who take democracy seriously."" Trump's use of force to allow him to walk across the park has also prompted Arlington County, Va., to pull its police officers out of the nation's capital. The county had sent a police contingent to help keep peace in Washington. But it says the officers were put in a dangerous position that exposed them and others to risk ""for a purpose not worthy of our mutual aid obligations."" ""All ACPD officers left the District of Columbia at 8:30 p.m. Monday,"" Arlington County says. The church has suffered damage during the unrest in Washington against police violence, including a fire that was lit in its basement.

PHOENIX — Gov. Doug Ducey has urged several Arizona mayors to aggressively confront any rioting in their communities and singled out Scottsdale as an example of how not to approach the problem due to the city’s response over the weekend to looting at an upscale mall. The governor told the mayors in a conference call on Sunday that their expectations “should be that these riots are coming to your town,” according to an audio recording of the call obtained by 12 News (KPNX-TV). Businesses in Scottsdale suffered millions of dollars in damages from thefts and extensive vandalism carried out by hundreds of people who gathered Saturday night outside Scottsdale Fashion Square. Some were carrying guns and threw rocks at officers. A dozen people were arrested. ADVERTISEMENTSkip ................................................................ Ducey, who ordered a curfew across Arizona the day after the mall was looted, contrasted the approaches of Scottsdale and Phoenix, where demonstrators have been protesting police brutality for the last five nights. Two hundred people were arrested Sunday after clashes in downtown Phoenix between police and civilians. Eighteen buildings were damaged, too. But no arrests were made in Monday’s protest, which ended peacefully shortly the 8 p.m. curfew took effect. The governor said in the call to mayors that Scottsdale officials claimed they had the situation under control. “The takeaway here is please be like Phoenix, not Scottsdale,” Ducey said. “It’s disappointing to me,” Scottsdale Mayor Jim Lane said of the governor’s criticism. “I thought it was a little less than supportive.” Lane, who like Ducey is a Republican, said his city’s police department was unfairly criticized for not having officers on the scene, when there were in fact dozens of Scottsdale officers at the mall shortly after people started to gather there. The Scottsdale Police Department declined a request Tuesday from The Associated Press to comment on Ducey’s criticism. Previously, Scottsdale police said they had 83 officers at the mall when dozens of people gathered there but were quickly overwhelmed as the crowd size grew to 500. They said other police departments were unable to quickly send officers to help out in Scottsdale, though 160 officers from other agencies eventually provided assistance at the scene. At a news conference on Sunday, Scottsdale officials said business people have good reason to be disappointed over the thefts and property damage, but said police were able to contain the rioters on or near the mall site and keep them out of neighborhoods. “I know we failed some people last night,” Scottsdale Police Chief Alan Rodbell said on Sunday. “But I once again want to reinforce that no one — no one — got hurt last night.” Protests have erupted in U.S. cities and Europe in the days after the death of George Floyd, a black man who died last week after the officer pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes even after he stopped moving and pleading for air. Phoenix’s first protest unfolded after a Thursday vigil for Dion Johnson, a 28-year-old black man who was fatally shot during an encounter with a state trooper along a city freeway.",0.0

PHOENIX — An Arizona judge has rejected a plea deal for a man who used a homemade armored vehicle to block a highway bridge near the Hoover Dam in 2018. Mohave County Judge Billy Sipe called the deal that would have given Matthew Wright less than 10 years in prison too lenient. Wright, 32, of Henderson, Nevada, pleaded guilty to making a terrorist threat and two other felony crimes as part of a deal in February. Wright had faced a potential life sentence and Sipe rejected the deal Monday at his sentencing hearing, The Arizona Republic reported. ADVERTISEMENTSkip ................................................................ Wright was arrested in June 2018 and faced multiple charges after blocking traffic by parking his vehicle across lanes on the Mike O’Callaghan-Pat Tillman Bridge above the Colorado River, prosecutors said. He surrendered to authorities on the Arizona side of the bridge after a 90-minute barricade situation that halted traffic on the main highway between Las Vegas and Phoenix. Police discovered two assault-style rifles, two handguns and 900 rounds of ammunition in Wright’s vehicle, authorities have said. Wright in a letter from jail said he was motivated by patriotism, using the phrase “for where we go one, we go all,” at the end of the letter. The phrase is used on message boards in the QAnon community, authorities said. QAnon conspiracy theories center around a supposed government insider who adherents believe is spooning out vital revelations using cryptic language and signs. Wright’s attorney Michael Denea said his client did not plan to use the weapons in his vehicle, adding that Wright carried out a misguided act of protest and just wanted to distribute literature. “He at no time intended on engaging law enforcement or anyone else in any act of violence using the weapons in his vehicle,” Denea said. Deputy county attorney Robert Moon said it was unclear what Wright intended but there was the potential for “great violence.” Wright declined to make a statement during the hearing, referring to a statement he had filed, which was not immediately available, the Arizona Republic reported.",0.0

Rudolph, whose sister Addie Mae Collins died in the bombing of 16th Street Baptist Church, had to see the sight for herself. She lowered a protective face mask to take in the absence of an edifice she long considered a symbol of oppression. “I’m glad it’s been removed because it has been so long, and we know that it’s a hate monument,” said Rudolph, 69. “It didn’t represent the blacks. It just represented the hard times back there a long time ago.” Confederate symbols across the South have been targeted for vandalism during demonstrations sparked by Floyd’s death in police custody in Minneapolis. Now, even some of their longtime defenders have decided to remove them. In Alexandria, Virginia, it was the United Daughters of the Confederacy that took action early Tuesday, removing the statue of a soldier gazing south from Old Town since 1889. And outside Tampa, Florida, a Sons of Confederate Veterans chapter lowered a huge Confederate battle flag that has long been flown in view of two interstate highways. Birmingham took down the obelisk a day after protesters tried to remove the monument themselves, during one of the many nationwide protests. Crews were preparing to finish the job by pulling up the base. The monument had been the subject of a protracted court battle between the city and state, which passed a law to protect Confederate icons after rebel monuments were challenged and removed following the killings at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina. Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall filed a lawsuit on Tuesday against the city of Birmingham, seeking to fine the city $25,000 for violating the state law. Mayor Randall Woodfin said earlier this week that the fine was more affordable than the cost of continued unrest in the city. Online fundraising drives have raised more than enough money to pay the fine. The state lawsuit does not specifically ask Birmingham to restore the monument. ADVERTISEMENTSkip ................................................................ Work to remove the monument began Monday, which was Alabama’s holiday honoring Confederate President Jefferson Davis, who was sworn in Montgomery. There, on the same day, someone knocked over a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee outside a mostly black high school named for him. Four people were arrested on criminal mischief charges, and the toppled statue was removed. In Alexandria, a city spokesman said the United Daughters of the Confederacy informed the city on Monday that it would remove the statue, and the city’s only role was to provide traffic support. By morning, the pedestal was all that was left. City officials were not told where the statue was taken. Titled “Appomattox,” it depicts a solitary Confederate soldier, his head bowed slightly. In 1890, a state law was passed barring local officials from ever removing it. That law was repealed earlier this year. Alexandria Mayor Justin Wilson tweeted photos of the removal on Tuesday, saying “Alexandria, like all great cities, is constantly changing and evolving.” In Birmingham, Rudolph saw the removal of the monument as unfinished business from decades ago. The more than 50-foot-tall (15-meter-tall) memorial to Confederate soldiers and sailors was located just blocks from the church where Rudolph was badly injured and her sister died when a bomb went off on a Sunday morning decades ago. “The things that we were fighting for in the ’60s aren’t solved yet,” said Rudolph, who testified against Ku Klux Klansmen convicted in the bombing. “We shouldn’t be treated the way they treat us.” ___ Associated Press writers Kim Chandler in Montgomery, Alabama; and Matthew Barakat in Falls Church, Virginia; contributed to this report.",0.0

It's president. Trump spoke in the Rose Garden. What happened in the city last night was a total disgrace. The president urging states to dominate the situation, calling the nation's Governors Week in a Monday conference call and going a step further during his prepared remarks. If a city or state refuses to take the actions that are necessary to defend the life and property of their residents, then I will deploy the United States military and quickly solve the problem for them. That message received immediate pushback. I say Thank you, but no, thank you. I care more about them. Then some of the noise I heard on a morning focal. Meanwhile, after protesters were cleared, the president walking across the street to ST John's Episcopal Church, which was damaged in a fire Sunday, stopping to hold up a Bible, a move condemned by church officials. I just can't believe what my eyes see tonight, Advertisement What you need to know about your rights if you're planning to take part in protests Share Shares Copy Link Copy Every American has the right to demonstrate peacefully. It's right there in the First Amendment. But it's not as simple as showing up with a sign.There are some measures officials can use to limit protests, and it's easy to accidentally tiptoe into legally murky territory if you don't know the specifics.So before you go, read up.Timothy Zick is a professor of government and citizenship at the College of William & Mary Law School. He specializes in constitutional law and the First Amendment, and he's written several books about both, including 2009's ""Speech Out of Doors: Preserving First Amendment Liberties in Public Spaces.""Emerson Sykes is a staff attorney with the ACLU's Speech, Technology and Privacy Project, who studies free speech protections under the First Amendment. Previously, he worked for Africa at the International Center for Not-for-Profit Law to protect free speech.1. What are my rights as a protester?The First Amendment gives Americans the right to assemble peacefully and air our grievances. Historically, we've relied on protests to hold power to account — think the March on Washington in 1963 for civil rights or the March for Our Lives demonstration in 2018 for gun control.The government can't stop you from peacefully protesting, but they can impose some restrictions on the time, place and manner of the protest — for example, barring protesters from walking onto a public highway or instituting a curfew that affects when protests end, Sykes said.They can't block a protest simply because of its content, though.If protests are planned in advance, organizers may obtain a permit so law enforcement can block off public spaces for them to demonstrate, Sykes said.There are protections, though, for ""spontaneous protests"" that spawn in response to current events, like the protests that spawned after George Floyd's death, he said.The First Amendment does not continue to protect protests that escalate to violence or the destruction of private or public property, he said.That's when law enforcement has the right to end them and deescalate threats of violence, he said.2. Where can and can't I protest?A slew of public spaces are OK for protests — sidewalks, city parks, streets and other public forums are usually lawful, Sykes said.Some states require you file a permit to block off streets, and the right to assembly doesn't give you the automatic right to march on a public highway, Zick said.People can be arrested or cited for blocking passage, he said.On private property, you don't have the right to assemble.Zick called it the ""no man's land"" in terms of the First Amendment, and police can move you off the property and keep you from demonstrating there.They may even have that right to move you even if you're on public property. Special rules apply to government buildings because protests may disrupt business going on inside, Sykes said.If the protest was permitted, you should be allowed to stay where you are — but leaving the permitted protest site may unintentionally lead you into prohibited places, he said.3. Can police or local leaders tell us to disperse?It depends, Sykes said: If a mayor pleads with people to go home, you have no legal obligation to comply.But police and local government can order you to leave, say, if they've imposed a curfew, as long as they give you ample notice to leave safely, Sykes said.If you stay on the street past a curfew — or if you protest on private property — you may be cited or arrested.4. What can I record?You have the right to take photos and videos of what's happening at a protest in a public place, and you can record police, too.Different states have different rules about audio recording and sharing that without the consent of the people whose voices you recorded, but the visual portion of videos and photos are always protected by the First Amendment, Sykes said.If you're interfering with legitimate police operations, they can ask you to move. It's best to videotape them from a safe distance.Police can't ask you to give them your phone or forcibly confiscate it without a search warrant, which they would've needed to obtain from a judge, he said.If they demand your phone, though, comply to avoid escalating the confrontation. Afterward, you can file a police misconduct complaint or contact the ACLU, he said.5. Someone took a picture of my face at a public protest. Is that allowed?At a public protest in the United States, you consent to a photo just by being there. Anyone who photographs you protesting in a public place may have a right to use your image, and you may see images of yourself in the media or online, Zick said.6. What should I pack to stay safe at a protest?Pack light, Sykes said. He suggests you bring water and a snack at minimum. If you bring a bag, prepare for it to be searched.In a pandemic, wearing a mask can keep you from breathing in droplets containing coronavirus. Coming within close contact of other protesters could expose you to their spit or sneezes, which may carry the coronavirus.Of course, keep an ID on your person, too.And if you fear you'll be arrested and will need legal help, memorize the number to a local or national law organization that could assist you in getting out of jail and handling your case afterward, Sykes said.7. What can — and can't — police do during a protest?It's the responsibility of police to protect your right to peaceful assembly.They're also empowered to uphold law and order, which gives them broad authority to deescalate threats of violence how they see fit.How they deescalate that violence depends on local laws and the circumstances under which they use them, which can be difficult to prove in court if you believe they used force unlawfully, Zick said.Like Sykes said, police do not have the right to search your phone or personal devices without a warrant, which only a judge can grant them.They also don't have permission to delete content from your phone, so if they tell you to delete a video you took or delete it themselves, they're in the wrong, he said.8. What can I do if a police officer stops me?Be polite. Don't resist.Ask them if you're free to go after speaking with them, Sykes said.If they say yes, calmly walk away and rejoin the protest if it's safe to.If they say no, and they detain you, don't resist and keep calm, Sykes said. Ask them what crime you're suspected of committing.9. What can I do if I get arrested?Some people get arrested intentionally as a form of civil disobedience. But whether or not you planned to get handcuffed, you shouldn't resist arrest, Sykes said.It's the best chance you have to stay safe.During your arrest, you can remain silent, as is your right, Sykes said.In some states, police are permitted to know your name if they ask, but they don't have the right to know where you're from or your citizenship status, he said.You can also ask for a lawyer — remember that number you held onto for legal support.If you're booked into jail, call a lawyer immediately, Sykes said.Police can't listen in on your call if you're phoning a lawyer, but they can listen in if you're calling a friend or family member, so be aware, he said.10. What can I do if I feel law enforcement or other officials violated my rights?You can sue for civil rights violations.You're allowed to do that under Section 1983 of federal law, which covers violations by state actors and police who violate First Amendment rights to assemble, speak and petition.Some protesters file large class-action suits that are occasionally successful, and sometimes authorities can pay damages when they decide litigation isn't worth it, Zick said.But qualified immunity can shield officers from civil liability if they didn't violate a clearly established law, he said.Qualified immunity is a legal doctrine that protects police officers accused of interfering with constitutional rights from being liable unless they violated a clearly established and defined law.The lines are blurred at protests of what police are allowed to do and what constitutes overreaching, so ""clearly established"" constitutional rights are difficult to determine, Zick said.In this way, many police officers are protected by qualified immunity, Sykes said.""Those cases are difficult to win and expensive in terms of personal time and resources,"" Zick said. ""Naturally, I think a lot of the protesters whose rights may well have been violated may not pursue cases.""11. Can my workplace fire me if they find out I attended a protest?That depends on the contract you made with your employer when you were hired, but yes, it's possible, Sykes said.You have stronger constitutional protections for what you do outside of work, but depending on what you agreed on when you were hired, a company may be able to terminate your employment, he said.",0.0

""When peaceful protesters are dispersed by the order of the president from the doorstep of the people's house, the White House — using tear gas and flash grenades — in order to stage a photo op at a noble church, we can be forgiven for believing that the president is more interested in power than in principle,"" Biden said. ""More interested in serving the passions of his base than the needs of the people in his care. For that's what the presidency is: the duty to care — to care for all of us."" On Monday evening, Trump walked from the White House across Lafayette Square to hold a Bible in front of St. John's Church, after peaceful protesters were forcibly cleared from the park. (The U.S. Park Police say they used smoke canisters, not tear gas, though it's not clear if another law enforcement agency engaged there used other munitions.) The forceful dispersal began before the Washington, D.C., curfew had begun, and the bishop overseeing the church has harshly criticized Trump for appearing for photos without praying or addressing the racial issues at the heart of nationwide protests. Trump made the trip after making a speech in which he threatened to deploy the military to states and cities that do not quell violence. ""The president held up the Bible at St. John's Church yesterday. I just wish he opened it once in a while instead of brandishing it,"" Biden said. ""If he opened it, he could have learned something: that we are all called to love one another as we love ourselves. It's really hard work, but it's the work of America. Donald Trump isn't interested in doing that work."" Biden echoed the words spoken by George Floyd, the black man whose death while in custody of Minneapolis police has led to the widespread unrest. The words ""I can't breathe,"" Biden said, ""are a wake-up call for our nation."" Biden addressed police abuses and economic disparities that affect what he called ""communities that have had a knee on their neck for a long time"" — alluding to the since-charged police officer who had his knee on Floyd's neck before he died. ""The moment has come for our nation to deal with systemic racism,"" Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, said. He asked Congress to take up measures he called ""a down payment on what is long overdue,"" including police reform bills outlawing chokeholds, banning the transfer of military weapons to police forces and establishing a uniform use of force standard. He said he would create a police oversight commission in his first 100 days as president. Biden also called for expanding the Affordable Care Act to millions more Americans, saying that Trump, who has long opposed the law, is ""consumed with his blinding ego when it comes to [former President] Barack Obama."" Obama's former vice president reiterated what he has long said on the 2020 campaign trail, that there is a ""battle for the soul of America."" ""Donald Trump has turned this country into a battlefield driven by old resentments and fresh fears,"" Biden said. ""He thinks division helps him. His narcissism has become more important than the nation's well-being that he leads. ""The presidency is a big job. Nobody will get everything right. And I won't either,"" Biden said. ""But I promise you this. I won't traffic in fear and division. I won't fan the flames of hate."" In a statement following his remarks, Katrina Pierson, a Trump campaign adviser, said Biden has ""obviously made the crass political calculation that unrest in America is a benefit to his candidacy."" She added: ""Over the course of his public life, Joe Biden has used the politics of racial division when they suited his needs and he is doing it again."" On Monday, Biden held his first in-person campaign event since the coronavirus took hold in the United States in mid-March. He met with African American faith leaders in Wilmington, Del., listening to at-times critical feedback from the group. Many of the invited guests chided Biden for a political system that has delivered ""hopelessness"" to young African Americans. They told him the Obama administration had not done enough to economically lift black Americans, something Biden then promised would be a centerpiece of any recovery plan from the administration.

But when a black police officer responding to the crowds kneeled to show support and other officers joined, a crowd erupted into praise, prompting protesters to shake the hands of police and hug them. Protesters in Fort Worth have been noting deaths such as George Floyd, who died on Memorial Day in Minneapolis after an officer pressed his knee on his neck for more than eight minutes. The officer, who was since fired, now faces third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter charges.Crowds there also have called attention to Atatiana Jefferson, whose family said she was playing video games with her nephew when a Fort Worth officer shot her in her home in October.

BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) — Sarah Collins Rudolph thought she’d never see what happened in her hometown: Prompted by protests, the city removed a 115-year-old Confederate monument near where her sister and three other black girls died in a racist church bombing in 1963. A wave of Confederate memorial removals that began after a white supremacist killed nine black people at a Bible study in a church in South Carolina in 2015 is again rolling, with more relics of the Old South being removed from public view after the killing of George Floyd by police in Minnesota. In Birmingham, where Rudolph lives, the graffiti-covered, pocked base of a massive Confederate monument was all that remained Tuesday after crews dismantled the towering obelisk and trucked it away in pieces overnight. Other symbols came down elsewhere, leaving an empty pedestal in Virginia and a bare flagpole in Florida. Rudolph, whose sister Addie Mae Collins died in the bombing of 16th Street Baptist Church, had to see the sight for herself. She lowered a protective face mask to take in the absence of an edifice she long considered a symbol of oppression. “I’m glad it’s been removed because it has been so long, and we know that it’s a hate monument,” said Rudolph, 69. “It didn’t represent the blacks. It just represented the hard times back there a long time ago.” Confederate symbols across the South have been targeted for vandalism during demonstrations sparked by Floyd’s death in police custody in Minneapolis.

Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall filed a lawsuit on Tuesday against the city of Birmingham, seeking to fine the city $25,000 for violating the state law. Mayor Randall Woodfin said earlier this week that the fine was more affordable than the cost of continued unrest in the city. Online fundraising drives have raised more than enough money to pay the fine. The state lawsuit does not specifically ask Birmingham to restore the monument. Work to remove the monument began Monday, which was Alabama’s holiday honoring Confederate President Jefferson Davis, who was sworn in Montgomery. There, on the same day, someone knocked over a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee outside a mostly black high school named for him. Four people were arrested on criminal mischief charges, and the toppled statue was removed. In Alexandria, a city spokesman said the United Daughters of the Confederacy informed the city on Monday that it would remove the statue, and the city’s only role was to provide traffic support. By morning, the pedestal was all that was left. City officials were not told where the statue was taken. Titled “Appomattox,” it depicts a solitary Confederate soldier, his head bowed slightly. In 1890, a state law was passed barring local officials from ever removing it. That law was repealed earlier this year. Alexandria Mayor Justin Wilson tweeted photos of the removal on Tuesday, saying “Alexandria, like all great cities, is constantly changing and evolving.” In Birmingham, Rudolph saw the removal of the monument as unfinished business from decades ago. The more than 50-foot-tall (15-meter-tall) memorial to Confederate soldiers and sailors was located just blocks from the church where Rudolph was badly injured and her sister died when a bomb went off on a Sunday morning decades ago. “The things that we were fighting for in the ‘60s aren’t solved yet,” said Rudolph, who testified against Ku Klux Klansmen convicted in the bombing. “We shouldn’t be treated the way they treat us.” ___ Associated Press writers Kim Chandler in Montgomery, Alabama; and Matthew Barakat in Falls Church, Virginia; contributed to this report.",0.0

ATLANTA (AP) — Six Atlanta police officers were charged Tuesday after dramatic video showed authorities pulling two young people from a car and shooting them with stun guns while they were stuck in traffic caused by protests over George Floyd’s death. Fulton County District Attorney Paul Howard announced the charges during a news conference. “I feel a little safer now that these monsters are off of the street and no longer able to terrorize anyone else,” said 22-year-old Messiah Young, who was dragged from the vehicle along with his girlfriend, 20-year-old Taniyah Pilgrim. The Saturday night incident first gained attention from video online and on local news. Throughout, the couple can be heard screaming and asking officers what is happening. Two of the officers were fired Sunday after Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms and police Chief Erika Shields determined they had used excessive force. The other four have been placed on administrative leave, police spokesman Sgt. John Chafee said in an email Tuesday. Pilgrim was released without charges. Howard said Young was charged with attempting to elude the officers, and the mayor has said she’s ordering his charges dropped. Body camera video from seven officers shows police taking another young man into custody in a downtown street. The man, whom Howard identified as Chancellor Meyers, tells officers he didn’t do anything. Sitting in the driver’s seat of a car stopped in the street, Young holds up his phone, shooting video as an officer approaches and pulls the driver’s door open. Young pulls the door shut and says repeatedly, “I’m not dying today.” He urges the officers to release Meyers and let him get in the car as the dark sedan advances a bit. The car gets stuck in traffic and officers run up to both sides of it, shouting orders. An officer uses a Taser on Pilgrim as she’s trying to get out of the car and then officers pull her out. Another officer yells at Young to open the window. An officer repeatedly hits the driver’s side window with a baton, and another officer finally manages to break it. As the glass shatters, an officer uses a Taser on Young and officers pull him from the car as officers shout, “Get your hand out of your pockets,” and, “He got a gun. He got a gun. He got a gun.” Once he’s out of the car and on the ground, officers zip tie Young’s hands behind his back and lead him away. Howard said no gun was found. Young suffered a fractured arm and a gash requiring 24 stitches as he was pulled from the car, Howard said. Young told Howard’s investigators that an officer who escorted him away after his arrest punched him in the back more than 10 times as they walked. “I’m so happy that they’re being held accountable for their actions,” Pilgrim said at the news conference. Young and Pilgrim are rising seniors at historically black colleges near downtown Atlanta. Young, from Chicago, is studying business management at Morehouse College. Pilgrim, from San Antonio, Texas, is studying psychology at Spelman College. The two officers who were fired Sunday — Investigator Ivory Streeter and Investigator Mark Gardner — were charged with four others. Streeter is charged with aggravated assault for using a Taser against Young and is also charged with pointing a gun at him, arrest warrants say. Gardner is charged with aggravated assault for using a Taser against Pilgrim, a warrant says Lonnie Hood is charged with aggravated assault against both Young and Pilgrim for using a Taser against both of them, an arrest warrant says. He is also charged with simple battery for violently pulling Pilgrim from the car and throwing her down on to the street, a warrant says. Willie Sauls is charged with aggravated assault for pointing a Taser at Pilgrim, a warrant says. He’s also charged with criminal damage for repeatedly hitting and damaging the driver’s side window of the car, a warrant says. Armon Jones is charged with aggravated battery for hurting Young’s left arm when he dragged him from the car and slammed him onto the street, a warrant says. He’s also charged with pointing a gun at Young. Roland Claud is charged with criminal damage for breaking the car’s windows, a warrant says. All of the charged officers are black except for Claud, who’s white. Atlanta Police Department sworn personnel is about 61% black, according to 2019 numbers provided by the department. Howard says he has asked a judge to set a signature bond of $10,000, which means they wouldn’t have to pay anything unless they fail to show up for court dates. The main reasons for that are to limit the number of people in the Fulton County jail during the coronavirus pandemic and because they are police officers, Howard said. The officers have been asked to turn themselves in by Friday, he said.",0.0
1623497734,2020-06-02 13:46:19,Biden blasts Trump’s ‘narcissism’ in new phase of campaign,https://www.abqjournal.com/1462133/biden-blasts-trumps-narcissism-in-new-phase-of-campaign.html,en,False,,99,Albuquerque Journal ,http://www.abqjournal.com/,"ADVERTISEMENTSkip ................................................................ “If he opened it instead of brandishing it, he could have learned something,” Biden said as he chided authorities for using “tear gas and flash grenades in order to stage a photo op.” Biden said Trump “might also want to open the U.S. Constitution. If he did, he’d find the First Amendment. It protects the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.” Trump senior advisor Kellyanne Conway denied that the president directed authorities’ actions to move back the protesters and bristled at suggestions the church visit was merely a photo op. She countered that Biden and other critics had no basis to second-guess what was in the president’s heart and his intentions. Still, Biden’s address marked a new phase of a presidential campaign that had been effectively frozen for more than two months by the spread of the coronavirus. The former vice president is now emerging from his Delaware home to confront Trump and using in-person appearances to offer direct competition with the president, rather than relying on virtual events that often failed to garner a lot of attention. It was the third consecutive day that Biden made a public appearance and the first time he’s been out of the state since March. His remarks were carried live on the three major cable news networks. Biden spoke as upheaval in the wake of George Floyd’s death has spread around the country. While Biden spoke, the National Guard maintained a visible presence to defend public buildings as Philadelphia continues to face sustained violent protests. Several buildings adjacent to City Hall, including banks, convenience stores and hotels, were boarded up. He spoke of the “tug of war between the American ideal that we are all created equal and the harsh reality that racism has long torn us apart.” “The honest truth is both elements are part of the American character,” he said. ADVERTISEMENTSkip ................................................................ Since the early days of his candidacy, Biden has framed the election as a “battle for the soul of the nation.” He went into greater detail on Tuesday about what that meant and the questions voters should ask themselves. “I ask every American to look at where we are now and think anew: Is this who we are?” he said. “Is this who we want to be? Is this what we pass on to our kids’ and grandkids’ lives? Fear and finger-pointing rather than hope and the pursuit of happiness? Incompetence and anxiety? Self-absorption and selfishness?” The tone was part of Biden’s effort to cast himself as a “consoler in chief” in stark contrast to Trump’s blunt, confrontational style. While he noted that his anguish over the death of his son Beau five years ago from cancer isn’t the same as the sadness felt by those protesting police brutality, he said he understood the hopelessness that can come with grief. “Like many of you, I know what it’s like to grieve,” Biden said. “I know what it feels like when you’re thinking you can’t go on.” He said “bad cops should be dealt with severely and swiftly” and offered examples of how he might ease racial tensions and govern. The former vice president called on Congress to act now on legislation that would place a federal ban on police using chokeholds. Biden also promised that, if elected, he would increase access to health care and improve the pay of first-responders and other workers who have stayed on jobs deemed essential during the pandemic. But Biden’s speech was perhaps most notable for its ferocity, even though his criticism of Trump is common. He accused the president of being more worried about himself than the nation at a time when it “is crying out for leadership.” “This president today is part of the problem and accelerates it,” Biden said, adding that Trump is “consumed with his blinding ego.” ADVERTISEMENTSkip ................................................................ Biden offered a stark departure from Trump, who tweeted Tuesday that Washington “had no problems last night” and cited “many arrests,” as well as “overwhelming force” and “Domination,” for which he thanked himself. Trump has embraced the language of confrontation and war, seeking to be a “president of law and order,” and betting that voters will want a more forceful approach at a time of national tumult and racial unrest. Katrina Pierson, a senior adviser to the president’s reelection campaign, said Biden’s speech “obviously made the crass political calculation that unrest in America is a benefit to his candidacy.” “President Trump is restoring the nation to order and is clearly the leader we need to return the country to peace and prosperity,” Pierson said in a statement. Despite his more confrontational approach, Biden was direct about the limits of his ability to singularly reconcile the nation’s differences. He was careful to note that his administration won’t be able to fix everything, especially not all at once. “I know that the presidency, that’s a very big job,” he said. “Nobody will get it right every time, and I won’t either.” But he vowed not to “traffic in fear and division.” “I won’t fan the flames of hate,” Biden said. “I’ll seek to heal the racial wounds that have long plagued our country, not use them for political gain.” ___ Weissert reported from Washington. ___ Catch up on the 2020 election campaign with AP experts on our weekly politics podcast, “Ground Game.”",0.0

""When peaceful protesters are dispersed by the order of the president from the doorstep of the people's house, the White House — using tear gas and flash grenades — in order to stage a photo op at a noble church, we can be forgiven for believing that the president is more interested in power than in principle,"" Biden said. ""More interested in serving the passions of his base than the needs of the people in his care. For that's what the presidency is: the duty to care — to care for all of us."" On Monday evening, Trump walked from the White House across Lafayette Square to hold a Bible in front of St. John's Church, after peaceful protesters were forcibly cleared from the park. (The U.S. Park Police say they used smoke canisters, not tear gas, though it's not clear if another law enforcement agency engaged there used other munitions.) The forceful dispersal began before the Washington, D.C., curfew had begun, and the bishop overseeing the church has harshly criticized Trump for appearing for photos without praying or addressing the racial issues at the heart of nationwide protests. Trump made the trip after making a speech in which he threatened to deploy the military to states and cities that do not quell violence. ""The president held up the Bible at St. John's Church yesterday. I just wish he opened it once in a while instead of brandishing it,"" Biden said. ""If he opened it, he could have learned something: that we are all called to love one another as we love ourselves. It's really hard work, but it's the work of America. Donald Trump isn't interested in doing that work."" Biden echoed the words spoken by George Floyd, the black man whose death while in custody of Minneapolis police has led to the widespread unrest. The words ""I can't breathe,"" Biden said, ""are a wake-up call for our nation."" Biden addressed police abuses and economic disparities that affect what he called ""communities that have had a knee on their neck for a long time"" — alluding to the since-charged police officer who had his knee on Floyd's neck before he died. ""The moment has come for our nation to deal with systemic racism,"" Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, said. He asked Congress to take up measures he called ""a down payment on what is long overdue,"" including police reform bills outlawing chokeholds, banning the transfer of military weapons to police forces and establishing a uniform use of force standard. He said he would create a police oversight commission in his first 100 days as president. Biden also called for expanding the Affordable Care Act to millions more Americans, saying that Trump, who has long opposed the law, is ""consumed with his blinding ego when it comes to [former President] Barack Obama."" Obama's former vice president reiterated what he has long said on the 2020 campaign trail, that there is a ""battle for the soul of America."" ""Donald Trump has turned this country into a battlefield driven by old resentments and fresh fears,"" Biden said. ""He thinks division helps him. His narcissism has become more important than the nation's well-being that he leads. ""The presidency is a big job. Nobody will get everything right. And I won't either,"" Biden said. ""But I promise you this. I won't traffic in fear and division. I won't fan the flames of hate."" In a statement following his remarks, Katrina Pierson, a Trump campaign adviser, said Biden has ""obviously made the crass political calculation that unrest in America is a benefit to his candidacy."" She added: ""Over the course of his public life, Joe Biden has used the politics of racial division when they suited his needs and he is doing it again."" On Monday, Biden held his first in-person campaign event since the coronavirus took hold in the United States in mid-March. He met with African American faith leaders in Wilmington, Del., listening to at-times critical feedback from the group. Many of the invited guests chided Biden for a political system that has delivered ""hopelessness"" to young African Americans. They told him the Obama administration had not done enough to economically lift black Americans, something Biden then promised would be a centerpiece of any recovery plan from the administration.

By the time the workers paused Tuesday morning, little was left of a spire that had become a lightning rod for controversy in recent years and a focal point for local protesters outraged by George Floyd's death last week in Minneapolis. On Sunday, the obelisk — known formally as the Confederate Sailors and Soldiers Monument — was the site of a speech from Birmingham Mayor Randall Woodfin, who pleaded with the crowd. Some protesters had already vandalized the monument and toppled another statue in the park, that one of former Confederate officer Charles Linn. Woodfin asked that demonstrators refrain from trying to tear down the much larger monument — so that his government could do it instead. ""Allow me to finish the job for you,"" the mayor told a crowd behind his mask and a megaphone. And he persuaded them to give him until midday Tuesday to pull the monument down. ""I wanted you to hear it directly from me. But I need you to stand down."" On Monday, Woodfin declared a state of emergency and implemented a curfew for the city, citing the previous night's protests during which police arrested at least two dozen people. Birmingham isn't the only city reckoning with its Confederate past in the aftermath of Floyd's death. Since the release of a video showing the black man's arrest in Minneapolis, during which a white officer plants a knee on Floyd's neck, protesters in several cities and towns below the Mason-Dixon Line have directed their frustration — and sometimes vandalism — toward local Confederate monuments. In Alexandria, Va., a statue commemorating Confederate soldiers came down Tuesday morning. It was removed a month earlier than scheduled by the United Daughters of the Confederacy due to fears of vandalism, according to The Washington Post. Alexandria, like all great cities, is constantly changing and evolving. pic.twitter.com/CZTjlOkpfT — Justin Wilson (@justindotnet) June 2, 2020 This week's move likely isn't the final chapter in the Birmingham monument's story, which was knotty well before the latest spasm of unrest trained attention back on it. Woodfin's predecessor, William Bell, ordered the memorial partly hidden with plywood screens in 2017 following the deadly violence in Charlottesville, Va. But Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall sued the city, citing a violation of a state law, the Alabama Memorial Preservation Act of 2017, which protects against the relocation or alteration of Confederate symbols that have been up for more than four decades. A unanimous state Supreme Court decision last fall sided with the monument's supporters, bringing the plywood down and assessing a fine of $25,000 against the city of Birmingham. Now Marshall has threatened another lawsuit over the city's move. ""Should the City of Birmingham proceed with the removal of the monument in question, based upon multiple conversations I have had today,"" the attorney general said in a statement issued Monday, ""city leaders understand I will perform the duties assigned to me by the [Alabama Memorial Preservation] Act to pursue a new civil complaint against the City.""

Today the Senate Judiciary Committee is beginning hearings on the origins of the FBI's Russia investigation. Republicans are also investigating what they claim is questionable dealings by the Biden family, although there's no evidence to support those CLAIMS.

DAVIS: Florida Senator Rick Scott joined every Republican on the Senate Homeland Security Committee last month to vote for a subpoena of Blue Star Strategies, a consulting firm that worked for Ukrainian energy company Burisma when Biden's son Hunter served on the board. A spokesman for the Biden campaign has accused Republicans of, quote, ""running a political errand"" for the president. This allegation is at the heart of Trump's impeachment.

Around the same time, a shot was heard in the area. No injuries or arrests were reported as of early Tuesday. As the steady evening rain slowed to a sprinkle, protesters called it a night around 10:15 p.m., many walking with drenched clothing and signs back up Central Ave. toward the middle of campus, where the march had begun. Minutes after organizers told protesters to head home, the Albuquerque Police Department radio dispatch indicated officers had seen men with long guns east of UNM. Then, just west of campus, protesters came upon a group of about nine mostly white men on the side of the road, by a white cargo van, with body armor and assault style weapons. Several protesters were upset and verbally confronted them, asking why there were there; others urged their fellow demonstrators to ignore the provocation and keep moving. ""We have a peaceful protest!"" one Black Lives Matter protester cried out repeatedly. ""Go home! Don't ruin it!"" The armed men said they were from the New Mexico Civil Guard and that they were there to protect people. The militia group has been recruiting people throughout New Mexico online since March, and made a showing at an Albuquerque anti-shutdown protest in late April. A post on their Facebook page, which features pro-Trump posts and people posing with yellow ""Don't Tread On Me"" flags, said their members would ""be protecting local businesses every night until Sunday"" this week, amid what they called “violent protests.” In the last week, Albuquerque has seen several peaceful protests calling for justice for George Floyd, who was killed by a Minneapolis police officer, and an end to police killings of black people. Some vandalism and violence did break out late Sunday and into early Monday morning in downtown Albuquerque, but it was well after most protestors had left. After Monday night's demonstration, there were tense interactions between the armed militiamen and unarmed protestors at the intersection of Central Avenue and Ash Street for about fifteen minutes, and then the departing protesters continued on. APD vehicles were stationed just blocks away along the perimeter of the rally route. No officers intervened. Shortly after, what sounded like a gunshot rang out near Central Ave. and Yale Blvd.; it was unclear from where or who. A helicopter circled overhead as dispatchers on the APD radio continued to flag that groups of armed men were potentially in the area, until about 11:30 p.m. By that time, protesters had cleared the streets.",0.0

Reuters reports flared demonstrators vented their anger over the killing of George Floyd by policeman Derek Chauvin. Floyd was an African American man who died in Minneapolis this week after a white police officer knelt on his neck. From Minneapolis to New York City, Atlanta, and Washington, protesters clashed with law enforcement over the treatment of minorities by the police. Prosecutors announced Friday that Chavin had been arrested on third-degree murder and manslaughter charges. Wochit ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. – The mayor of New Mexico’s largest city is blaming small groups of what he called agitators for violence that broke out hours after hundreds of people gathered for a largely peaceful protest in downtown Albuquerque. Dozens of small fires were set, windows were broken and police officers say they were fired upon early Monday in front of the historic Kimo Theater. Police were responding after the building’s windows were broken and some people got on the roof. Police moved in because they were afraid the building would be set on fire. Another group tried later to force a confrontation with police but ended up leaving. The latest: George Floyd vigil planned for Monday by Branigan Library Mayor Tim Keller said there dozens of firearms looted from at least one gun shop and that there was damage to numerous locally-owned coffee shops, breweries and restaurants along the Central Avenue corridor. He said he was grateful no one was seriously injured. While Albuquerque welcomes the right to protest, Keller said gunfire and violence cross the line. “What we saw last night in downtown was not a protest, it was not Albuquerque,” he said. “Protesting is our constitutional right as Americans. We have the strongest voice when we come together and use it as one and express our outrage.” In this May 31, 2020, photo, demonstrators hold a moment of silence at the Civic Plaza in Albuquerque, N.M. after marching along the city's historic Route 66, protesting the death of George Floyd in Minnesota.

(Photo: Russell ContrerasAP) City crews spent the morning boarding up broken windows as other workers picked up debris and cleaned off graffiti. On Sunday evening, several hundred people took part in a march along historic Route 66 in protest of the death of George Floyd, the black man who died after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck even after he stopped moving and pleading for air. The protesters held signs, wore masks and chanted: “Say his name: George Floyd” and “Hands up, don’t shoot.” When the crowd arrived on the western edge of downtown Sunday evening, they stopped, raised their fists into the air and held a moment of silence for Floyd that was followed by cheers. More: George Floyd died from 'asphyxiation from sustained pressure,' family autopsy finds Activist Arthur Bell, 35, later told fellow demonstrators he was “tired of being peaceful.” He said his black skin makes him a target for police and that he is fed up with the situation. Another protest was planned for Monday evening outside police headquarters. Bell said that demonstration would be different. When The Associated Press asked what he meant, Bell said: “A general never gives out his tactics.” While elected leaders in other states have been forced to call out the National Guard, Albuquerque officials said there are no plans to make such a request unless the situation descends into chaos. The mayor said officials will do whatever they can to keep it from getting to that point and he asked for the public’s help. “We can do this without violence on our own city and without more violence on each other,” Keller said. City officials also talked about court-mandated efforts over the past several years to restructure the police department, changes to the way it deals with excessive force and the inclusion of anti-racism and ethics training for police officers and all city employees.

Michelle Lujan Grisham in a statement Monday afternoon condemned the violence in Albuquerque, saying she was concerned that a small group of people “took a wrong turn.” “That sort of behavior is an attempt to distort the important work of the peaceful protesters – who have every right to demonstrate in peace – and puts both the protesters and public safety officers at risk,” she said. “Those individuals, I have complete confidence, will be held accountable. There is no place in this moment for hijacking the protesters’ message of justice and non-violence.” Albuquerque police said two people were arrested overnight on misdemeanor charges.

LAS CRUCES - About 300 people gathered Monday night at the lawn in front of Branigan Memorial Library, for a vigil to honor Minnesota man George Floyd, who was killed by police last week. Protesters carried signs that read, ""Police are the Real Virus,"" ""Enough is Enough,"" and ""Black Lives Matter,"" chanted, ""no justice, no peace,"" and the name ""George Floyd,"" and raised fists in the air. Cheers erupted through the crowd as vehicles and even a semi-truck passed by blaring their horns, seemingly in support of the movement. Stay informed. Sign up for a subscription to the Sun-News. On May 25, Floyd became the latest unarmed black person to die at the hands of a law enforcement officer when former police officer Derek Chauvin knelt on his neck for almost nine minutes despite Floyd's plea that he couldn't breathe. The vigil took place around the statue of Albert Johnson, who became the first black mayor of Las Cruces in 1976. A sign that read, ""Rest in Power George Floyd,"" was taped to the base of the statue. As night fell, vigil attendees lit candles.

Other symbols came down elsewhere, leaving an empty pedestal and a bare flagpole. Workers hired by the city of Birmingham began removing the top portion of the 115-year-old monument from Linn Park late Monday.

She was seriously injured in the blast at 16th Street Baptist Church, and testified against Ku Klux Klansmen who were convicted in the killings.

Crews were expected to return later Tuesday to finish the job, a city official said. The monument had been the subject of a protracted court battle between the city and state. Alabama authorities said Birmingham would face a $25,000 assessment for violating a state law that bans the removal of such monuments. Mayor Randall Woodfin said the fine would be much more affordable than the cost of continued unrest in the city. Work to remove the monument began on Monday, which happened to be Alabama’s holiday honoring Confederate President Jefferson Davis, who was sworn in on the steps of the state Capitol in Montgomery. There, on the same day, someone knocked over a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee outside a mostly black high school named for him, news outlets reported. In Alexandria, a city spokesman said the United Daughters of the Confederacy informed the city on Monday that it would remove the statue, and the city’s only role was to provide traffic support. By morning, the pedestal was all that was left. City officials were not told where the statue was taken. Titled “Appomattox,” it depicts a solitary Confederate soldier, his head bowed slightly. In 1890, a state law was passed barring local officials from ever removing it. That law was repealed earlier this year.

His tactics were decried Tuesday by some fellow Republicans as well as his presumptive Democratic opponent. The violent dispersal of peaceful protests near the White House the night before was a potent symbol of Trump’s policing tactics and a physical manifestation of the rhetorical culture war he has stoked since before he was elected. Moments after historic Lafayette Park was cleared, Trump walked across to pose with a Bible in front of a church damaged by fire during protests the previous evening. “D.C. had no problems last night. Many arrests. Great job done by all. Overwhelming force. Domination,” Trump tweeted Tuesday, after a night in which heavily armed military forces and federal officers swarmed the city. Trump added: “(thank you President Trump!).” The president wanted to make the aggressive action in the nation’s capital — where he wields disproportionate powers — an example for the rest of the country, a senior White House official said Tuesday, speaking on condition of anonymity because the official was not authorized to discuss internal thinking. Trump hoped his personal walk to the church, after federal officials dispersed protesters, would send a message about how dominant force could restore law and order. The president has threatened that if states do not take tough enough action,he will deploy active duty military across the country to quell unrest in the wake of the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. “SILENT MAJORITY!” Trump tweeted Tuesday, embracing a phrase popularized by President Richard Nixon decades ago, in claiming broad support for his actions. Trump also emphasized the political importance of the moment to his supporters on Twitter and declared that “My Admin has done more for the Black Community than any President since Abraham Lincoln.” The District of Columbia’s federal status gives the president outsized authority to act, allowing him to direct the deployment of the National Guard. He authorized Attorney General William Barr to oversee a surge in the deployment of federal law enforcement officers, including the FBI’s Hostage Rescue Team and agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration. Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Gen. Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, sought to distance themselves from Monday night’s events after former military officials criticized their appearance with the president. Senior defense officials told reporters the two were not aware that the Park Police and law enforcement had made a decision to clear the square or that Trump intended to visit the church. They had been in Washington to coordinate with federal law enforcement officials but were diverted to the White House to brief Trump on military preparations, the officials said. Former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, said of Trump posing for photos holding up a Bible: “I just wish he opened it once in a while.” And D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser said of the routing of the protesters, “At no time do we think it was appropriate that people who had not violated the curfew or anything else received that treatment.” Democrats weren’t the only ones saying Trump had gone too far. “There is no right to riot, no right to destroy others’ property, and no right to throw rocks at police,” said Nebraska Republican Sen. Ben Sasse. “But there is a fundamental — a constitutional — right to protest, and I’m against clearing out a peaceful protest for a photo op that treats the Word of God as a political prop.” It was Barr who gave the order Monday afternoon for law enforcement to clear out the protest before Trump’s walk to the church and ahead of Washington’s 7 p.m. curfew. Officials said the decision to clear the park was made earlier in the day in response to violence the night before. Trump also ordered military aircraft to fly above Washington on Monday night as a “show of force,” according to two Defense Department officials. They said the U.S. military and National Guard were operating under the mission name “Operation Themis.” In Greek mythology, Themis is a titaness of divine law and order, whose symbols are the scales of justice. Execution of the order to clear the park created striking split-screen images as officers deployed pepper spray, flash bangs and mounted units to break up the peaceful protest even as Trump was in the Rose Garden saying he supported the rights of peaceful protesters. Chemical remnants still hung in the air as he walked to the church. Trump reacted to the clearing of the protesters with enthusiasm, pumping his fist at officers in the park. He’d been furious about weekend images juxtaposing the fires in the area with the darkened White House in the background, according to current and former campaign and administration officials not authorized to speak publicly about private conversations.

1623602219,2020-06-02 16:01:41,"Embracing religious themes, Trump visits John Paul II shrine",https://www.krqe.com/news/politics/embracing-religious-themes-trump-visits-john-paul-ii-shrine/,en,True,,662160,KRQE,https://www.krqe.com/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Claiming he is backed by a “silent majority,” President Donald Trump turned the nation’s capital into a model for the overwhelming force he believes critical to stop sometimes-violent protests that have spread across the country in a time of racial unrest. His tactics were decried Tuesday by some fellow Republicans as well as his presumptive Democratic opponent. The violent dispersal of peaceful protests near the White House the night before was a potent symbol of Trump’s policing tactics and a physical manifestation of the rhetorical culture war he has stoked since before he was elected. Moments after historic Lafayette Park was cleared, Trump walked across to pose with a Bible in front of a church damaged by fire during protests the previous evening. “D.C. had no problems last night. Many arrests. Great job done by all. Overwhelming force. Domination,” Trump tweeted Tuesday, after a night in which heavily armed military forces and federal officers swarmed the city. Trump added: “(thank you President Trump!).” The president wanted to make the aggressive action in the nation’s capital — where he wields disproportionate powers — an example for the rest of the country, a senior White House official said Tuesday, speaking on condition of anonymity because the official was not authorized to discuss internal thinking. Trump hoped his personal walk to the church, after federal officials dispersed protesters, would send a message about how dominant force could restore law and order. The president has threatened that if states do not take tough enough action,he will deploy active duty military across the country to quell unrest in the wake of the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. “SILENT MAJORITY!” Trump tweeted Tuesday, embracing a phrase popularized by President Richard Nixon decades ago, in claiming broad support for his actions. Trump also emphasized the political importance of the moment to his supporters on Twitter and declared that “My Admin has done more for the Black Community than any President since Abraham Lincoln.” The District of Columbia’s federal status gives the president outsized authority to act, allowing him to direct the deployment of the National Guard. He authorized Attorney General William Barr to oversee a surge in the deployment of federal law enforcement officers, including the FBI’s Hostage Rescue Team and agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration. Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Gen. Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, sought to distance themselves from Monday night’s events after former military officials criticized their appearance with the president. Senior defense officials told reporters the two were not aware that the Park Police and law enforcement had made a decision to clear the square or that Trump intended to visit the church. They had been in Washington to coordinate with federal law enforcement officials but were diverted to the White House to brief Trump on military preparations, the officials said. Former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, said of Trump posing for photos holding up a Bible: “I just wish he opened it once in a while.” And D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser said of the routing of the protesters, “At no time do we think it was appropriate that people who had not violated the curfew or anything else received that treatment.” Democrats weren’t the only ones saying Trump had gone too far. “There is no right to riot, no right to destroy others’ property, and no right to throw rocks at police,” said Nebraska Republican Sen. Ben Sasse. “But there is a fundamental — a constitutional — right to protest, and I’m against clearing out a peaceful protest for a photo op that treats the Word of God as a political prop.” It was Barr who gave the order Monday afternoon for law enforcement to clear out the protest before Trump’s walk to the church and ahead of Washington’s 7 p.m. curfew. Officials said the decision to clear the park was made earlier in the day in response to violence the night before. Trump also ordered military aircraft to fly above Washington on Monday night as a “show of force,” according to two Defense Department officials. They said the U.S. military and National Guard were operating under the mission name “Operation Themis.” In Greek mythology, Themis is a titaness of divine law and order, whose symbols are the scales of justice. Execution of the order to clear the park created striking split-screen images as officers deployed pepper spray, flash bangs and mounted units to break up the peaceful protest even as Trump was in the Rose Garden saying he supported the rights of peaceful protesters. Chemical remnants still hung in the air as he walked to the church. Trump reacted to the clearing of the protesters with enthusiasm, pumping his fist at officers in the park. He’d been furious about weekend images juxtaposing the fires in the area with the darkened White House in the background, according to current and former campaign and administration officials not authorized to speak publicly about private conversations. Trump was also angry about the news coverage revealing that he had been rushed to the White House bunker during weekend protests, believing the park fires in what amounts to his extended front yard made him appear weak. But some White House and Justice Department officials privately acknowledged that Monday’s events didn’t serve the administration well.

Reuters reports flared demonstrators vented their anger over the killing of George Floyd by policeman Derek Chauvin. Floyd was an African American man who died in Minneapolis this week after a white police officer knelt on his neck. From Minneapolis to New York City, Atlanta, and Washington, protesters clashed with law enforcement over the treatment of minorities by the police. Prosecutors announced Friday that Chavin had been arrested on third-degree murder and manslaughter charges. Wochit ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. – The mayor of New Mexico’s largest city is blaming small groups of what he called agitators for violence that broke out hours after hundreds of people gathered for a largely peaceful protest in downtown Albuquerque. Dozens of small fires were set, windows were broken and police officers say they were fired upon early Monday in front of the historic Kimo Theater. Police were responding after the building’s windows were broken and some people got on the roof. Police moved in because they were afraid the building would be set on fire. Another group tried later to force a confrontation with police but ended up leaving. The latest: George Floyd vigil planned for Monday by Branigan Library Mayor Tim Keller said there dozens of firearms looted from at least one gun shop and that there was damage to numerous locally-owned coffee shops, breweries and restaurants along the Central Avenue corridor. He said he was grateful no one was seriously injured. While Albuquerque welcomes the right to protest, Keller said gunfire and violence cross the line. “What we saw last night in downtown was not a protest, it was not Albuquerque,” he said. “Protesting is our constitutional right as Americans. We have the strongest voice when we come together and use it as one and express our outrage.” In this May 31, 2020, photo, demonstrators hold a moment of silence at the Civic Plaza in Albuquerque, N.M. after marching along the city's historic Route 66, protesting the death of George Floyd in Minnesota.

(Photo: Russell ContrerasAP) City crews spent the morning boarding up broken windows as other workers picked up debris and cleaned off graffiti. On Sunday evening, several hundred people took part in a march along historic Route 66 in protest of the death of George Floyd, the black man who died after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck even after he stopped moving and pleading for air. The protesters held signs, wore masks and chanted: “Say his name: George Floyd” and “Hands up, don’t shoot.” When the crowd arrived on the western edge of downtown Sunday evening, they stopped, raised their fists into the air and held a moment of silence for Floyd that was followed by cheers. More: George Floyd died from 'asphyxiation from sustained pressure,' family autopsy finds Activist Arthur Bell, 35, later told fellow demonstrators he was “tired of being peaceful.” He said his black skin makes him a target for police and that he is fed up with the situation. Another protest was planned for Monday evening outside police headquarters. Bell said that demonstration would be different. When The Associated Press asked what he meant, Bell said: “A general never gives out his tactics.” While elected leaders in other states have been forced to call out the National Guard, Albuquerque officials said there are no plans to make such a request unless the situation descends into chaos. The mayor said officials will do whatever they can to keep it from getting to that point and he asked for the public’s help. “We can do this without violence on our own city and without more violence on each other,” Keller said. City officials also talked about court-mandated efforts over the past several years to restructure the police department, changes to the way it deals with excessive force and the inclusion of anti-racism and ethics training for police officers and all city employees. Others are reading: Hundreds of mourners pay tribute to George Floyd in Minneapolis Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham in a statement Monday afternoon condemned the violence in Albuquerque, saying she was concerned that a small group of people “took a wrong turn.” “That sort of behavior is an attempt to distort the important work of the peaceful protesters – who have every right to demonstrate in peace – and puts both the protesters and public safety officers at risk,” she said. “Those individuals, I have complete confidence, will be held accountable. There is no place in this moment for hijacking the protesters’ message of justice and non-violence.” Albuquerque police said two people were arrested overnight on misdemeanor charges.

COLUMBIA, S.C. — Hundreds of cities have imposed curfews to keep the peace during a week of violent unrest across the U.S., employing a tactic that gives law enforcement sweeping arrest powers but is frequently flouted and criticized as being unconstitutional. From New York City to Fargo, North Dakota, cities large and small have put curfews in place — in some cases for the first time in decades — sending out emergency notices on phones and highway signs urging people to stay off the streets. But the deadlines aren’t hard and fast — many of them have exceptions for people heading to and from work, reporters, public transportation and even people buying groceries. Many protesters and citizens have routinely disregarded the restrictions, and police have allowed peaceful demonstrations to continue after curfew while focusing their attention on violent unrest. ADVERTISEMENTSkip ................................................................ In New York City, an 11 p.m. curfew was originally put in place this week for what appeared to be the first time in nearly 80 years. Mayor Bill de Blasio rolled it back to 8 p.m., but thousands of people defied the curfew Tuesday night, continuing to march in parts of Brooklyn and Manhattan. After initially standing by and letting protesters continue, officers began ordering people to leave and some people were taken into custody. On an overall calmer night in New York City, de Blasio said the relative quiet was due partly to the curfew. ” So far, the curfew is certainly helping, based on everything I’ve seen in Brooklyn and Manhattan over the last three hours,” de Blasio tweeted. A curfew allows police the ability without any other reason to threaten to arrest or detain crowds of protesters that linger or groups that appear to be a danger to order. And curfews can be a deterrent to get law-abiding citizens off the street and allow police to focus their efforts on the unrest and not get bogged down in run-of-the-mill violations. They have been installed in Los Angeles, Atlanta, Detroit, Denver, Philadelphia and hundreds of other cities and communities across the country. Curfews aren’t unusual in the United States but are typically used in natural disasters like hurricanes, floods and tornadoes to allow law enforcement to stop anyone on the streets and prevent stealing when many homes and empty or damaged. New York City has used curfews in specific locations like parks — sometimes with controversial results. The 1988 Tompkins Square Park riot in Manhattan had to do in part with a then-newly imposed 1 a.m. parks department curfew in a bid to rid the park of drugs and crime. In enforcing the curfew, police flooded the park with officers and were accused of rampant abuses. Former Mayor Rudy Giuliani ramped up enforcement of Central Park’s nightly closure after a string of robberies in the late 1990s. Giuliani was so strict about the curfew, he wouldn’t grant an exception for a late-night vigil to John Lennon, despite intercession from the lord mayor of Liverpool on behalf of aggrieved Beatles fans. During the unrest of the past week, police also want bystanders off the street during unrest — and the curfew solves that. ADVERTISEMENTSkip ................................................................ “The curfew really is to keep people from coming sort of to gawk at what’s going on and keep the looky-loos away,” said Sacramento City Councilman Steve Hansen, whose city’s 8 p.m. Monday curfew appeared to help prevent the destructive demonstrations from the night before. The curfews also come on the heels of lockdowns and stay-at-home orders imposed during the coronavirus pandemic, making for an unprecedented stretch in cities like New York. In Columbia, South Carolina, officials lifted a weekend curfew and the mayor joined an afternoon protest at the state capitol calling for police reform. But several dozen people stayed for hours after the protest ended as tensions with police grew as shadows got longer. Just before 7:30 p.m. Monday, Columbia, South Carolina , Mayor Steve Benjamin set a curfew for 7:45 p.m. for a small area of downtown and an areas of restaurants and shops. The city sent an emergency notice and protesters looked at their screens as their phones started to buzz and the curfew set in. The protesters immediately started to walk away. But some civil rights organizations think hastily issued curfews are unfair and against the First Amendment of the Constitution. “By making presence on public streets anywhere in these cities unlawful, these measures give police too much discretion over whom to arrest,” said the American Civil Liberties Union of Northern California after a number of cities issued curfews. New York City on Monday found out an unintended consequence of a curfew is keeping away law-abiding protesters. The night before, they banded together to stop vandalism and help police find lawbreakers. It also sends a subtle message, said New York City Council member Ydanis Rodriguez. ADVERTISEMENTSkip ................................................................ “Implementing a curfew and increasing the number of police officers patrolling the streets is a tactic to effectively silence the voices raised in protest against the abuse of power and looting of black and colored bodies by members of the police,” Rodriguez said. Curfews can cause other problems too. Charleston, South Carolina, had a curfew for three days after late night Saturday protests led to shattered windows for restaurants and businesses and stolen merchandise downtown. Monday night was quiet. And Charleston Mayor John Tecklenburg said he immediately heard from a certain group of people. “We want to give our businesses a chance to get back into business,” Tecklenburg told his City Council at a Tuesday meeting lifting the curfew. A curfew also allows police to separate people who want to protest while following the law from people who want to cause harm, said Tamara Herold, an assistant professor in the Criminal Justice Department at the University of Nevada-Las Vegas. That makes it easier for law enforcement to decide how to use force to break up unrest. “One of the things police always want to avoid is using indiscriminate force against a large crowd,” Herold said. ___ Associated Press Writers Claudia Lauer and Adam Beam contributed to this report.",0.0

By the time the workers paused Tuesday morning, little was left of a spire that had become a lightning rod for controversy in recent years and a focal point for local protesters outraged by George Floyd's death last week in Minneapolis. On Sunday, the obelisk — known formally as the Confederate Sailors and Soldiers Monument — was the site of a speech from Birmingham Mayor Randall Woodfin, who pleaded with the crowd. Some protesters had already vandalized the monument and toppled another statue in the park, that one of former Confederate officer Charles Linn. Woodfin asked that demonstrators refrain from trying to tear down the much larger monument — so that his government could do it instead. ""Allow me to finish the job for you,"" the mayor told a crowd behind his mask and a megaphone. And he persuaded them to give him until midday Tuesday to pull the monument down. ""I wanted you to hear it directly from me. But I need you to stand down."" On Monday, Woodfin declared a state of emergency and implemented a curfew for the city, citing the previous night's protests during which police arrested at least two dozen people. Birmingham isn't the only city reckoning with its Confederate past in the aftermath of Floyd's death. Since the release of a video showing the black man's arrest in Minneapolis, during which a white officer plants a knee on Floyd's neck, protesters in several cities and towns below the Mason-Dixon Line have directed their frustration — and sometimes vandalism — toward local Confederate monuments. In Alexandria, Va., a statue commemorating Confederate soldiers came down Tuesday morning. It was removed a month earlier than scheduled by the United Daughters of the Confederacy due to fears of vandalism, according to The Washington Post. Alexandria, like all great cities, is constantly changing and evolving. pic.twitter.com/CZTjlOkpfT — Justin Wilson (@justindotnet) June 2, 2020 This week's move likely isn't the final chapter in the Birmingham monument's story, which was knotty well before the latest spasm of unrest trained attention back on it. Woodfin's predecessor, William Bell, ordered the memorial partly hidden with plywood screens in 2017 following the deadly violence in Charlottesville, Va. But Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall sued the city, citing a violation of a state law, the Alabama Memorial Preservation Act of 2017, which protects against the relocation or alteration of Confederate symbols that have been up for more than four decades. A unanimous state Supreme Court decision last fall sided with the monument's supporters, bringing the plywood down and assessing a fine of $25,000 against the city of Birmingham. Now Marshall has threatened another lawsuit over the city's move. ""Should the City of Birmingham proceed with the removal of the monument in question, based upon multiple conversations I have had today,"" the attorney general said in a statement issued Monday, ""city leaders understand I will perform the duties assigned to me by the [Alabama Memorial Preservation] Act to pursue a new civil complaint against the City.""

On Wednesday, the Senate Judiciary Committee begins the first of a planned series of hearings on the origins of the FBI's 2016 Russia investigation into possible ties with the Trump campaign. Republicans are particularly interested in the decision-making inside the Obama-Biden administration.

Running a political errand for Donald Trump by wasting Homeland Security Committee time and resources attempting to resurrect a craven, previously-debunked smear against Vice President Biden.""

Today the Senate Judiciary Committee is beginning hearings on the origins of the FBI's Russia investigation. Republicans are also investigating what they claim is questionable dealings by the Biden family, although there's no evidence to support those CLAIMS.

DAVIS: Florida Senator Rick Scott joined every Republican on the Senate Homeland Security Committee last month to vote for a subpoena of Blue Star Strategies, a consulting firm that worked for Ukrainian energy company Burisma when Biden's son Hunter served on the board. A spokesman for the Biden campaign has accused Republicans of, quote, ""running a political errand"" for the president. This allegation is at the heart of Trump's impeachment.

1623652216,2020-06-02 16:05:43,Armed Militia Group Alarms BLM Protesters Late Monday After Peaceful Rally,https://www.krwg.org/post/armed-militia-group-alarms-blm-protesters-late-monday-after-peaceful-rally,en,False,,214420,krwg.org,http://krwg.org/,"After hundreds of people demonstrated peacefully on and around the University of New Mexico campus Monday night, armed militia men showed up along Albuquerque’s Central Ave., causing fear and confusion among Black Lives Matter protesters heading home. Around the same time, a shot was heard in the area. No injuries or arrests were reported as of early Tuesday.  As the steady evening rain slowed to a sprinkle, protesters called it a night around 10:15 p.m., many walking with drenched clothing and signs back up Central Ave. toward the middle of campus, where the march had begun.    Minutes after organizers told protesters to head home, the Albuquerque Police Department radio dispatch indicated officers had seen men with long guns east of UNM.    Then, just west of campus, protesters came upon a group of about nine mostly white men on the side of the road, by a white cargo van, with body armor and assault style weapons. Several protesters were upset and verbally confronted them, asking why there were there; others urged their fellow demonstrators to ignore the provocation and keep moving.    ""We have a peaceful protest!"" one Black Lives Matter protester cried out repeatedly. ""Go home! Don't ruin it!""    The armed men said they were from the New Mexico Civil Guard and that they were there to protect people. The militia group has been recruiting people throughout New Mexico online since March, and made a showing at an Albuquerque anti-shutdown protest in late April. A post on their Facebook page, which features pro-Trump posts and people posing with yellow ""Don't Tread On Me"" flags, said their members would ""be protecting local businesses every night until Sunday"" this week, amid what they called “violent protests.”    In the last week, Albuquerque has seen several peaceful protests calling for justice for George Floyd, who was killed by a Minneapolis police officer, and an end to police killings of black people. Some vandalism and violence did break out late Sunday and into early Monday morning in downtown Albuquerque, but it was well after most protestors had left.  After Monday night's demonstration, there were tense interactions between the armed militiamen and unarmed protestors at the intersection of Central Avenue and Ash Street for about fifteen minutes, and then the departing protesters continued on. APD vehicles were stationed just blocks away along the perimeter of the rally route. No officers intervened.    Shortly after, what sounded like a gunshot rang out near Central Ave. and Yale Blvd.; it was unclear from where or who.  A helicopter circled overhead as dispatchers on the APD radio continued to flag that groups of armed men were potentially in the area, until about 11:30 p.m. By that time, protesters had cleared the streets.",0.0

(Photo: Bill Armendariz - Headlight Photo) DEMING – The developing news on the death of George Floyd while handcuffed and detained by Minneapolis police has reached the ears and eyes of concerned citizens in Deming, NM. Nine such citizens met at Luna County Courthouse Park on Monday to draw attention to their protest built around the ""Black Lives Matter"" rallying cry. Floyd, a security guard at a Minneapolis restaurant/bar, was handcuffed with hands behind his back as a suspect in the passing of a counterfeit bill. While Floyd resisted, he was put on his stomach and restrained by a Minneapolis police officer with a knee to the back of the head and neck area. Floyd repeatedly complained about not being able to breath while being restrained and later died. MPD officer Derek Chauvin has been arrested and charged with a third-degree murder of Floyd. Deming homemaker and student, Kathrine Price, and her sister began researching the death of Floyd and were moved by the incident and the following repercussions that included peaceful demonstrations followed by violence, rioting and looting perpetrated by angry mobs across the nation. ""Our message is peace and love for people of all races,"" Price said. ""We posted something on the Deming Revamped page on Facebook to let people know we would be at the park. It was just my sister and my son but it quickly grew. Based on that, we decided to come out and raise awareness in hopes of delivering our peaceful message."" Buy Photo A group of nine concerned citizens demonstrated on Monday at Luna County Courthouse Park in response to the death of George Floyd while being detained by Minneapolis police as a suspect in a counterfeit bill passing. (Photo: Bill Armendariz - Headlight Photo) Price moved to Deming a year ago from Tucson, AZ. The two sisters, along with Price's son, made a couple of signs and stood in protest on Sunday at the park. ""More people took notice and came out to share peace and love today,"" Price said. The signs had a clear message that dealt with race relations, civil rights and the injustice minorities have faced in the past. Albuquerque became a hot spot over the weekend as peaceful protests were followed by violent outbursts, resulting in criminal damage to downtown businesses and even shots being fired when a mob formed after the peaceful demonstration had concluded. President Donald Trump spoke about the civil unrest across the nation from the White House Rose Garden on Monday. He instructed governors of major cities to bring in the National Guard to ""dominate"" those instigating the rioting, looting and vandalism. Trump said if governors did not bring in the Guard, he would order a military presence in its place. Price noted the local rally response by passersby has been mixed. ""We get more love than hate,"" she said. ""Sure, we get people cussing and flipping us off, but our message is to get people thinking and to not be afraid to speak up and be heard."" Izabella Collings stood with her sign in protest on Monday after seeing and reading about the group on Facebook. Collings is of African-American descent and said she began a ""Black Lives Matter"" page on social media once she saw the Price page on Facebook. ""It quickly grew to 72 friends,"" Collings said. ""I shouldn't be afraid for my life that I may be stopped in my vehicle by the police,"" she said. The nine protesters practiced social distancing and also wore face masks during their time at the park. ""There is power in numbers, and the more people to stand up for justice through peaceful demonstration, the more change will come,"" Price said.

PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) — As demonstrators flooded streets across America to decry the killing of George Floyd, public health experts watched in alarm — the close proximity of protesters and their failures in many cases to wear masks, along with the police using tear gas, could fuel new transmissions of the coronavirus. Many of the protests broke out in places where the virus is still circulating widely in the population. In fact, an Associated Press review found that demonstrations have taken place in every one of the 25 U.S. communities with the highest concentrations of new cases. Some have seen major protests over multiple days, including Minneapolis-St. Paul, Chicago, Washington, D.C., and Los Angeles. The protests have come just as communities across the nation loosen restrictions on businesses and public life that have helped slow the spread of the virus, deepening concern that the two factors taken together could create a national resurgence in cases. “As a nation, we have to be concerned about a rebound,” Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser warned Sunday after days of protests rocked the nation’s capital. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo bemoaned the crowds, saying that hundreds could potentially have been infected, undoing months of social distancing. A fresh outbreak in the places where protesters gathered could lead to reinstituting shutdowns. The AP’s review focused on large metro counties — the central counties within metro areas with more than 1 million people — that showed the highest rates of new cases per capita over the past 14 days. While case numbers and deaths have been trending down in several of the cities where the largest protests have occurred, the number of people in those places infected with the virus — and with the ability to spread it — remains high. And in some of the communities, such as Minneapolis, the number of people hospitalized with COVID-19 has been rising. Floyd died May 25 after a Minneapolis police officer pressed a knee into his neck for several minutes, even as he pleaded that he couldn’t breathe. Minneapolis has been ground zero for the sprawling protests, which have crossed the Mississippi River into neighboring St. Paul. The unrest has coincided with “the very worst days of the pandemic so far” in the Twin Cities metropolitan area, said Michael T. Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota. “Our ICU bed care is at its all-time high and is really on the edge,” he said. Ramsey and Hennepin counties, home to the Twin Cities, ranked seventh and eighth for the highest per capita new cases in the AP analysis. Each has seen more than 250 cases per 100,000 population in the past two weeks, together reporting nearly 2,000 new cases in the last week alone. Experts point out that other factors associated with protests could accelerate the spread of the virus. For instance, tear gas can cause people to cough and sneeze, as can the smoke from fires set by people bent on destruction. And both also prompt protesters to remove their masks. Crowding protesters who have been arrested into jail cells can also increase the risk of contagion. An AP tally found that, thus far, more than 5,600 people have been taken into custody. Protesters and police shouting at one another nose-to-nose also is raising alarms. Osterholm and other public health experts note, however, that the protests aren’t necessarily as alarming as other events that could fuel new cases because they take place outside and many people are wearing masks. In some cases, hand sanitizer also is being informally distributed. And Dr. David Eisenman, director of the Center for Public Health and Disasters at the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health, said he feared partisan forces might accuse cities of bringing fresh cases on themselves. “I’m actually more worried about how, if those spikes occur, how that information will be weaponized against the notion of protests,” he said. Eisenman called protesting an “essential activity,” possible to practice with reduced risk. He said his grown children protested in Los Angeles and are taking safety precautions now, including isolating themselves at home. They plan to get tested for COVID-19 in about a week. Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician and public health professor at George Washington University, said the hospitalizations for coronavirus in the Washington metro area have been on the decline but that she knows that could change. “There are a lot of unknowns about what happens next,” she said. Wen was the health commissioner for the city of Baltimore during the 2015 uprising after the death of Freddie Gray in police custody and said many health clinics were closed and pharmacies burned down, making it difficult for members of disadvantaged communities to access health care. It’s a concern for her now, too. “You will have compounded health issues that go beyond COVID-19,” she said. Public health experts said it will take two to three weeks to know whether the protests cause a surge in coronavirus cases. And even then, they can’t definitively tie it to the demonstrations. The unrest is happening in tandem with the reopening of gyms, hair salons, restaurants, parks and beaches. It also comes on the heels of the Memorial Day weekend, when many people attended large gatherings, so experts already were bracing for a case increase, said Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins University. In Los Angeles, barbershops and in-person dining were allowed to resume last weekend, just as protests descended into destruction and more than 1,000 people were arrested. Nearly 10,000 new cases have been reported in Los Angeles County in the past week. Hundreds of people also were arrested in Chicago, where Cook County has had among the highest per capita rates of new cases of any large county in the nation, with 283 new cases per 100,000 population in the past two weeks. “The absolute number of cases is still high. We feel good about the fact that we’ve established a decreasing incidence, but we have a ways to go,” said Dr. Ronald Hershow the director of the Division of Epidemiology and Biostatistics at the University of Illinois-Chicago. Hershow and others noted that the racial disparities laid bare by coronavirus — with communities of color bearing a disproportionate burden of infections and deaths — overlap with the issues being protested on streets across America and around the globe. “Racism kills,” Hershow said. “Sometimes that’s direct, as in the case of George Floyd. And sometimes it’s through a virus like COVID-19.” ___ Forster reported from Berkley, Massachusetts.",0.0

MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — The state of Minnesota on Tuesday launched a civil rights investigation of the Minneapolis Police Department in hopes of forcing widespread changes following the death of George Floyd, a black man who died after a white officer pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck for minutes, even after he stopped moving. Gov. Tim Walz and the Minnesota Department of Human Rights announced the filing of the formal complaint at a news conference Tuesday afternoon. The governor and Human Rights Commissioner Rebecca Lucero said they hope to reach agreement with the city to identify short-term ways to address the police department’s history of racial discrimination, and use the investigation to find long-term solutions for systemic change. Lucero said their goal is to negotiate a consent decree with the city that courts could enforce with injunctions and financial penalties. There are precedents, she said, including a consent decree approved in Chicago last year after the U.S. Justice Department found a long history of racial bias and excessive use of force by police. Widely seen bystander video showing Floyd’s death has sparked sometimes violent protests around the world. The officer, Derek Chauvin, has been fired and charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Three other officers involved were fired but have not been charged. “We know that deeply seated issues exist,” the governor said. “And the reason I know it is we saw the casual nature of the erasing of George Floyd’s life and humanity. We also know by the reaction of the community. They expected nothing to happen, and the reason is because nothing did happen for so many times.” Walz said the investigation into the police department’s policies, procedures and practices over the past 10 years will determine if the force has engaged in systemic discrimination toward people of color, and root it out. Lucero will lead the investigation. All 12 members of the Minneapolis City Council endorsed a statement read by Council President Lisa Bender at a news conference later Tuesday in support of the investigation. “We urge the state to use its full weight to hold the Minneapolis Police Department accountable for any and all abuses of power and harms to our community and stand ready to aid in this process as full partners,” the council said. Mayor Jacob Frey said the state’s intervention will help break what he called a stalemate on reform. “For years in Minneapolis, police chiefs and elected officials committed to change have been thwarted by police union protections and laws that severely limit accountability among police departments,” Frey said in a statement. “I welcome today’s announcement because breaking through those persistent barriers, shifting the culture of policing, and addressing systemic racism will require all of us working hand in hand.” A police department spokesman and the president of the officers’ union didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. The FBI is also investigating whether police willfully deprived Floyd of his civil rights. The Minnesota Department of Human Rights enforces the state’s human rights act, particularly as it applies to discrimination in employment, housing, education, public accommodations and public services. Mediation is one of its first-choice tools, but the cases it files can lead to fuller investigations and sometimes end up in litigation. The Minneapolis Police Department has faced decades of allegations of brutality and other discrimination against African Americans and other minorities, even within the department itself. Critics say its culture resists change, despite the elevation of Medaria Arradondo as its first black police chief in 2017. Arradondo himself was among five black officers who sued the police department in 2007 over alleged discrimination in promotions, pay, and discipline. They said in their lawsuit that the department had a history of tolerating racism and discrimination. The city settled the lawsuit for $740,000. State Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington, who was neighboring St. Paul’s second black police chief, said good officers should welcome the investigation. He co-chaired a working group with Attorney General Keith Ellison that reported back in February on ways to reduce police-involved deadly force encounters. “I’ve been a cop for 40 years. I have lived in this system that they’re talking about reforming. … The cops I talk to, the cops I’ve worked with since 1977 to date will tell you, they want change,” Harrington said. “They don’t want to work in a flawed system. They don’t want to have to be wearing gas masks. They don’t want to have to be on riot control duty.” Earlier Tuesday, an attorney for Floyd’s family again decried the official autopsy that found his death was caused by cardiac arrest as police restrained him and compressed his neck. The medical examiner also listed fentanyl intoxication and recent methamphetamine use, but not as the cause of death. A separate autopsy commissioned for Floyd’s family concluded that that he died of asphyxiation due to neck and back compression. “The cause of death was that he was starving for air. It was lack of oxygen. And so everything else is a red herring to try to throw us off,” family attorney Ben Crump said. He said the Hennepin County medical examiner went to great lengths to try to convince the public that what was shown on bystander video didn’t cause Floyd to die. Ellison told ABC’s “Good Morning America” that prosecutors are working as fast as they can to determine whether more charges will be filed.",0.0

The Latest on the May 25 death in Minneapolis of George Floyd, a handcuffed black man who pleaded for air as a white police officer pressed a knee on his neck: TOP OF THE HOUR: — Thousands of protesters on New York City streets after curfew. — Protest in Washington on Tuesday lacking tension of previous night’s demonstrations. — Thousands march in protest in Los Angeles and other California cities. — The Minneapolis school board votes to end its contract with the Minneapolis Police Department. ___ NEW YORK — Thousands of demonstrators protesting the death of George Floyd remained on New York City streets on Tuesday after an 8 p.m. curfew put in place by officials struggling to stanch destruction and growing complaints that the nation’s biggest city was reeling out of control night after night. Mayor Bill de Blasio had doubled down on a citywide curfew, moving it up from 11 p.m. a night earlier, but rejected urging from President Donald Trump and an offer from Gov. Andrew Cuomo to bring in the National Guard. Protests had resumed Tuesday during the day over the death of Floyd, a black man who died on May 25 after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed a knee on his neck even after he stopped moving and pleading for air. People marched in groups of thousands in parts of Manhattan and Brooklyn, as merchants boarded up their businesses. As the the curfew time arrived, many were still in the streets and continued marching, with officers initially standing by and allowing them. But officers started ordering people to move along, and began taking people into custody. Demonstrators who had been on the West Side Highway in lower Manhattan were herded off, with parts of the roadway blocked off behind them. “Something has to break, and it’s not going to be us,” said Evan Kutcher, one of hundreds of demonstrators who stood outside the Barclays Center chanting Floyd’s name Tuesday evening. “We’re here because something needs to change. ___ WASHINGTON — The protest in the nation’s capital on Tuesday night lacked the tension of the previous nights’ demonstrations. The crowd outside Lafayette Park near the White House was peaceful, polite even, as they protested the death of George Floyd while in police custody in Minnesota. Instead of the spray-painted tags, the protesters Tuesday favored colorful children’s street chalk, writing Black Lives Matter slogans on the asphalt in front of St. John’s Church. Protesters chanted and talked among themselves, most wearing masks, but not social distancing in the age of COVID-19. One protester, Mati Yiheyis, a 21-year-old college student at the University of Virginia, speculated that fears of coronavirus kept many older people away. When one protester climbed a lamp post and removed a street sign he was roundly booed by others. “It’s not what we’re about,” said protester George “T.J.” Pierce of Washington. The crowd started thinning out on its own after 8 p.m., an hour after a curfew went into place, although a core group of several hundred remained at the fence, chanting at the line of police and soldiers in riot gear on the other side. On Monday, law enforcement officers on foot and horseback aggressively drove protesters away from Lafayette Park, clearing the way for President Donald Trump to do a photo op at St. John’s Church, known as the church of presidents. On Tuesday, pastors at the church prayed with demonstrators and handed out water bottles. ___ LOS ANGELES — Thousands have taken to the streets of Los Angeles in peaceful protests Tuesday, and smaller demonstrations dotted other California cities while authorities renewed overnight curfews in LA and other areas that have seen clashes with police and groups of thieves wreck hundreds of businesses. There were several sizable demonstrations in Los Angeles and Mayor Eric Garcetti took a knee at one while in a crowd outside police headquarters. However, later in the day, hundreds gathered outside the mayor’s house and protested. Elsewhere in the city, police cordons backed by National Guard troops kept a tight watch on marchers in Hollywood, where hundreds were arrested a day earlier, and at a crowd of thousands at City Hall. In San Francisco, a mass of people marched up the Great Highway along San Francisco’s Ocean Beach. At San Jose’s City Hall, several hundred people showed up for a demonstration and speeches organized by the local branch of the NAACP. San Francisco Police Chief William Scott asked supervisors Tuesday to keep an overnight curfew order for at least the “next few days” to get ahead of people bent on using peaceful protests to pilfer stores and commit violence. Mayor London Breed ordered the 8 p.m. curfew Sunday following a night of thefts downtown, including at a major shopping mall where several fires were set. ___ MELBOURNE, Australia — Police are urging thousands of demonstrators planning to attend a protest rally in Australia’s second-largest city over George Floyd’s death to reconsider due to social distancing rules. Victoria Police Assistant Commissioner Luke Cornelius on Wednesday described the rally planned for Saturday as the largest mass gathering in Melbourne since pandemic restrictions were introduced in March. Public gatherings are limited to 20 people in Victoria state, and people must keep 1.5 meters (5 feet) apart. Australia has recorded 7,221 coronavirus cases with 26 in hospitals on Wednesday. There have been 102 deaths. Cornelius did not say whether police plan to fine protesters, but told reporters that “police would prefer people obey the law.” Police have not enforced social distancing regulations when thousands gathered peacefully in Sydney and Perth in solidarity with U.S. demonstrators and to protest against the over-representation of indigenous Australians in prisons. Protesters attempted to get around social distancing rules by demonstrating over an unrelated issue in their cars in Melbourne in April. But police fined 26 of them 1,652 Australian dollars ($1,145) each and arrested their organizer for breaching a ban on non-essential travel. That ban has since been lifted. ___ MINNEAPOLIS — The Minneapolis school board has voted to end its contract with the Minneapolis Police Department following the death last week of George Floyd. The Star Tribune reports the vote was unanimous Tuesday. Minneapolis Public Schools will stop further negotiations with the Police Department. Schools Superintendent Ed Graff must come up with a new plan for school safety by the board’s Aug. 18 meeting. School board chairwoman Kim Ellison said in an interview that she values “people and education and life.” Ellison said she’s now convinced, “based on the actions of the Minneapolis Police Department, that we don’t have the same values.” The Minneapolis and St. Paul school districts have faced criticism over the use of school resource officers. Both districts have sought to transform the role to be more of a mentor than an enforcer. ___ BEIJING — An official Chinese Communist Party newspaper is hammering President Donald Trump’s call to send in troops to put down protests and rioting with an editorial published Wednesday entitled “Quelling Protests With Troops Self-Contradictory For US.” The paper, known as strongly nationalist and for its anti-American views, wrote: “This could be argued as the most extreme response to disorder among governments across the world.” “Then why did Washington arrogantly and unreasonably accuse other countries of quelling riots? Why did politicians in Washington overbearingly portray the U.S. as the beacon of democracy and human rights? Have they really not anticipated that the U.S. could one day confront the situation as it does today and that their previous big talk could become a slap on their face?” The editorial attacked the U.S. for continuing to criticize Hong Kong’s heavy-handed approach to sometimes violent anti-government protests, and for Beijing’s move to enact national security legislation for the territory, while the U.S. failed to respond earlier to the coronavirus pandemic and police now battle protesters on American city streets. “The hooligan nature of Washington makes it a complete nuisance,” the paper said. ___ WASHINGTON — The U.S. Park Police denied using tear gas to disperse a crowd of protesters outside the White House on Monday night, saying officers instead used smoke canisters and pepper balls to aggressively push back the demonstrators. Protesters scrambled as smoke filled the streets and AP journalists witnessed people reacting to their eyes and throats becoming irritated. Journalists covering the protest reported the crowd was largely peaceful at the time; the Park Police said they were responding to protesters throwing items, including bricks and frozen water bottles at law enforcement. Justice Department officials offered a different explanation, saying officers were carrying out Attorney General William Barr’s order to expand the security perimeter outside the White House. Officers repelled the crowd nearly 30 minutes ahead of a 7 p.m. curfew in Washington. Shortly after the crowd was pushed back, President Donald Trump walked through the park where they had gathered for a photo opportunity at a nearby church. ___ DALLAS — Former President George W. Bush criticized any effort to squelch protests of George Floyd’s death while in Minneapolis police custody. In a statement issued Tuesday by his office in Dallas, the former Republican president said he and wife Laura Bush “are anguished by the brutal suffocation of George Floyd and disturbed by the injustice and fear that suffocate our country.” Bush did not refer specifically toward President Donald Trump, but he called the harassment and threats toward African American protesters “a shocking failure.” “It is a strength when protesters, protected by responsible law enforcement, march for a better future. … Those who set out to silence those voices do not understand the meaning of America — or how it becomes a better place,” he said. ___ MINNEAPOLIS — The mother of George Floyd’s 6-year-old daughter, Gianna, said Tuesday that she wanted the world to know that her little girl lost a good father who would never get to see his daughter grow up. “I want everybody to know that this is what those officers took. At the end of the day, they get to go home and be with their families,” Roxie Washington said during a Minneapolis news conference with her young daughter at her side. “I’m here for my baby and I’m here for George because I want justice for him. I want justice for him because he was good. No matter what anybody thinks, he was good.” Floyd died on Memorial Day after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee into the black man’s neck for several minutes even after he stopped moving and pleading for air. ___ LITTLE ROCK, Ark. — Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson declared a state of emergency Tuesday in response to continued demonstrations to protest the death of George Floyd in the custody of Minneapolis police. A statement from the governor’s spokeswoman said the action will unify command of local and state police, the Arkansas National Guard and the state Department of Emergency Management. The spokeswoman minimized the significance of the move, however. “This is a normal executive order issued when the National Guard is activated under state control in regard to civil disturbance. Under this executive order, sheriff offices and police departments maintain command and operational control of their respective jurisdictions,” Katie Beck said in her statement. Also Tuesday, Little Rock Mayor Frank Scott expanded the city’s curfew a day after Arkansas authorities again used tear gas to break up protests outside the state Capitol. Scott said the city’s nighttime curfew will begin 8 p.m. ___ ATLANTA — Hundreds of protesters lingered on the streets of downtown Atlanta on Tuesday night ahead of another 9 p.m. curfew imposed by Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms. Authorities used armored vehicles to form a cordon at the state Capitol nearby. Bottoms has implemented the curfew every night, starting Saturday. As the curfew took effect, police and National Guard troops moved in, firing tear gas. The crowd quickly dispersed, and television footage showed police leading some people away in zip ties. ___ SEATTLE — Mayor Jenny Durkan addressed a large crowd protesting George Floyd’s death in Minneapolis, telling them their “voices holding me accountable are important.” Tuesday was the fifth day of protests in the Northwest’s largest city over the death of Floyd in police custody. Monday’s protests were largely peaceful but turned chaotic as officers dispersed the crowd at night using tear gas and flash-bang devices. Authorities said demonstrators threw fireworks and tried to storm a barricade, but citizen video showed the chaos began when an officer grabbed a pink umbrella that a demonstrator was holding just across a barricade. Standing next to the city’s police chief at the downtown Emergency Operations Center, Durkan said she supported the crowd’s right to rally against injustice. “We want you to march, we want you to raise your voices, we want you to continue on your path of justice,” Durkan said over a microphone as the crowd listened, mostly in silence. “But we need you, please, to do it peacefully.” The mayor, a former U.S. attorney, then took questions from some in the crowd. ___ ST. PAUL, MINN. — Thousands of protesters gathered on the front lawn of the Minnesota Capitol as part of a youth protest for George Floyd on Tuesday afternoon. The crowd listened to speakers and periodically chanted slogans like, “Say his name: George Floyd.” William Ray, 22, said his protest was about more than just George Floyd’s death last week. His grandparents were civil rights activists in the 60s and also members of the Black Panther Party. “I grew up with an understanding of what needs to be done, growing up with them and seeing the change that they brought to the community. … America was built off of slaves — my ancestors. A lot of the systems that were in place then are still here,” he said. Christine Ohenzuwa, 19, of Blaine, Minnesota, said she’s felt disheartened by the “endless cascade of hashtags of black people dying.” Of the unrest that has gripped cities across the nation, she said, “there’s always going to be a breaking point.” “It’s really painful to see what’s going on, but it’s also really important to understand that it’s connected to a system of racial violence,” she said. ___ WASHINGTON — A former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff says he was “sickened” to see National Guard troops and other security personnel forcibly clear protesters from a square near the White House to facilitate President Donald Trump’s walk to a nearby church to pose for photographers. Calling the visit Monday a “stunt,” Mike Mullen, a retired Navy admiral who headed the military from 2007 to 2011, wrote in The Atlantic on Tuesday it laid bare what he called Trump’s “disdain” for the rights of peaceful protesters. He said it also risked further politicizing the military. Mullen cautioned against an overly aggressive use of the military to restrain the sometimes-violent protests around the country. He said he has confidence in the professionalism of the troops but worries about the soundness of the orders they would be given by Trump. ___ MIAMI — A demonstration in Miami grew to about 400 people as protesters marched from a courthouse to a historically black neighborhood north of downtown. Demonstrators sat on one knee during several stops to listen to organizers shouting instructions that they were to remain peaceful and hydrated in the 80-degree weather. They shouted “No justice, no peace, no racist police” as more than 30 officers followed the group a few blocks behind wearing body armor. Twenty-two-year-old Trinity Auberry arrived at the demonstration with four other friends. It was the first time protesting for the young black model who said the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis is not isolated and cases of “police brutality” are also common in Florida. ___ CHARLESTON, W.Va. — The West Virginia National Guard is pursuing disciplinary action against a guardsman who posted on social media that he would shoot at people protesting the death of George Floyd, officials said Tuesday. The guardsman, Noah Garcelon, has already resigned his position as an officer with the Winfield Police Department after making the comments. In a series of now-deleted posts, Garcelon wrote that he would “start firing live rounds” at protesters and “see how many I can run over before my car breaks down.” Maj. Gen. James Hoyer, who leads the state’s National Guard, said officials will be taking the appropriate disciplinary action related to Garcelon and any others “who make inflammatory comments related to protests going on across the nation.” Winfield Police Department Chief Ron Arthur said Garcelon acknowledged that he made the comments and stressed that he wasn’t a racist before resigning. West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice, a Republican, has urged people to remain peaceful but said he would not hesitate to call in the National Guard if demonstrations in the state became violent. ___ COLUMBIA, S.C. — About 100 people gathered in front of the state capitol building in downtown Columbia, South Carolina, on Tuesday afternoon as medics passed out water bottles and snacks and volunteers passed out voter registration forms. Participants raised their fists in unison as passing commuters showed their solidarity with honks and waves. An outreach minister emphasized the need to sustain demonstrations past the initial events over the weekend and also urged a peaceful nature in the afternoon’s demonstrations. Minister Danielle Ford told the crowd, “they’re waiting on us to give up, they’re waiting on us to get tired, they’re waiting on us to give in. We need you out here.” A 21-year-old college student said she was protesting for justice for George Floyd as well as Joshua Ruffin, a 17-year-old shot to death by a Columbia police officer after a foot chase in April. ___ HOUSTON — Houston rappers Bun B and Trae Tha Truth organized a march on Tuesday and told the crowd it would be peaceful. After asking the crowd of several thousand to look for anybody who could cause trouble, Bun B then led them on a chant. He said “What’s his name?” and the crowd replied, “George Floyd.” The crowd later got down on one knee and was silent for 30 seconds. Among those participating was a group of about 60 people on horseback from a riding club in Houston. ___ LOS ANGELES — Los Angeles Police Chief Michel Moore said Tuesday more than 2,700 people have been arrested since protests and violence began in the nation’s second-largest city. The chief told the city Police Commission that about 2,500 of those arrests were for failure to disperse or curfew violations. The remainder were for crimes including burglary, looting, assaults on police officers and other violence. The chief gave the figures during a report to the Police Department’s civilian oversight board. Several new demonstrations in Los Angeles on Tuesday over the death of George Floyd have remained peaceful. ___ PARIS — Riot officers have fired tear gas as scattered protesters threw projectiles and set fires during an unauthorized demonstration against police violence and racial injustice. Several thousand people had previously rallied peacefully for two hours Tuesday around the main Paris courthouse in homage to George Floyd and to Adama Traore, a French black man who died in police custody. Police had banned the protest because of coronavirus restrictions that forbid any gathering of more than 10 people. As the demonstration wound down, police fired tear gas and protesters could be seen throwing projectiles. Two small fires broke out. Tensions also erupted at a related protest Tuesday in the southern city of Marseille. ___ CHICAGO — Authorities in a Chicago suburb where two people were fatally shot in unrest following George Floyd’s death are issuing fresh safety precautions Tuesday. Cicero officials cautioned residents to “stay home and stay off the streets” a day after violence and destruction erupted in the town of about 84,000 west of Chicago. Police say most of Monday’s chaos stemmed from residents trying to defend businesses. Roughly 60 people were arrested, mostly for burglary and weapons violations. Two men in their 20s were fatally shot around 6 p.m. in separate incidents related to the violent clashes. ___ TRENTON, N.J. — Citing George Floyd’s death, New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir Grewal said Tuesday the state will update its guidelines governing the use of force by police for the first time in two decades and will move to require a statewide licensing program for all officers. At least 43 other states require some licensing requirement for officers, Grewal said, adding he wants to bring law enforcement in line with other professions that require licensing. The announcements also include a pilot program in a handful of cities across the state to conduct training programs aimed at promoting safe interactions between police and communities and the implementation of a statewide database to document when police use force, Grewal said. ___ MINNEAPOLIS — The state of Minnesota has filed a civil rights charge against the Minneapolis Police Department in the wake of George Floyd’s death. The state says it will investigate the department’s policies and practices over the last 10 years to determine whether it has engaged in “systemic” discrimination against people of color. The complaint comes from the state Department of Human Rights, which enforces the state’s human rights act. It targets a police department that has faced decades of allegations of brutality and other discrimination against African-Americans and other minorities including within the department itself. Critics say the department has a culture that resists change and the department has come under fresh criticism after Floyd died after a white officer knelt on his neck and ignored his cries of “I can’t breathe” until Floyd eventually stopped moving. ___ WASHINGTON — Attorney General William Barr ordered law enforcement officials to clear Lafayette Park and push back the perimeter around the White House when he arrived there Monday evening, leading to police using tear gas to disperse protesters. A person familiar with the matter tells The Associated Press that Barr expected the perimeter to have been extended much earlier Monday. The person could not discuss the matter publicly and spoke to AP on condition of anonymity. The person said officials had met that morning and decided the perimeter had to be moved by at least one full block after multiple fires were set in the park the night before. They said that was expected to happen by Monday afternoon. The person said Barr was surprised it hadn’t been done when he arrived in the early evening and directed action to be taken. They said he assumed police would use “typical crowd control measures” against protesters who resisted commands to clear the area. ___ MINNEAPOLIS — Prosecutors are delaying the case against a man who drove his semitrailer into a crowd of protesters on a closed Minneapolis freeway. The 35-year-old man drove his tanker truck into the midst of thousands of people who had gathered on Interstate 35W near downtown Minneapolis on Sunday. Authorities said it appeared no one was hurt and the man was arrested. Gov. Tim Walz said the man became confused and somehow got on the freeway before traffic officials closed it. Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman announced Tuesday that the case against the man has been deferred pending further investigation and he’ll be released from jail. Freeman said investigators are working to gather additional information to help in making a charging decision. ___ WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump ordered military aircraft to fly above the nation’s capital Monday night as a “show of force” against demonstrators protesting the death of George Floyd, according to two Department of Defense officials. Show-of-force missions are designed to intimidate and, in combat zones, warn opposing forces of potential military action if provoked. The officials, who insisted on anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss ongoing operations publicly, did not say how many or what type of aircraft had been mobilized. Videos and photographs posted on social media showed helicopters flying low over buildings and hovering just above groups who were on the street despite a district-wide curfew. On Tuesday, roughly 700 members of the Army’s 82nd Airborne Division had arrived at two military bases near Washington. Another 1,400 soldiers are ready to be mobilized within an hour, the two Pentagon officials said. The soldiers are armed and have riot gear as well as bayonets. The officials said the mission has been named “Operation Themis.” In Greek mythology, Themis was a titaness of divine law and order, whose symbols are the scales of justice. — Reporting by James LaPorta",0.0

COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) — Hundreds of cities have imposed curfews to keep the peace during a week of violent unrest across the U.S., employing a tactic that gives law enforcement sweeping arrest powers but is frequently flouted and criticized as being unconstitutional. From New York City to Fargo, North Dakota, cities large and small have put curfews in place — in some cases for the first time in decades — sending out emergency notices on phones and highway signs urging people to stay off the streets. But the deadlines aren’t hard and fast — many of them have exceptions for people heading to and from work, reporters, public transportation and even people buying groceries. Many protesters and citizens have routinely disregarded the restrictions, and police have allowed peaceful demonstrations to continue after curfew while focusing their attention on violent unrest. A curfew allows police the ability without any other reason to threaten to arrest or detain crowds of protesters that linger or groups that appear to be a danger to order. And curfews can be a deterrent to get law-abiding citizens off the street and allow police to focus their efforts on the unrest and not get bogged down in run-of-the-mill violations. New York City put in place a large-scale curfew for what appeared to be the first time in nearly 80 years this week as groups vandalized buildings and stole from stores. The curfew was originally 11 p.m., but Mayor Bill de Blasio rolled it back to 8 p.m., before the sun goes down. “If you choose to protest today, do it in the daytime hours and then please go home because we have work to do to keep a peaceful city,” de Blasio said. Curfews have been installed in Los Angeles, Atlanta, Detroit, Denver. Philadelphia and hundreds of other cities and communities across the country. Curfews aren’t unusual in the United States but are typically used in natural disasters like hurricanes, floods and tornadoes to allow law enforcement to stop anyone on the streets and prevent stealing when many homes and empty or damaged. New York City has used curfews in specific locations like parks — sometimes with controversial results. The 1988 Tompkins Square Park riot in Manhattan had to do in part with a then-newly imposed 1 a.m. parks department curfew in a bid to rid the park of drugs and crime. In enforcing the curfew, police flooded the park with officers and were accused of rampant abuses. Former Mayor Rudy Giuliani ramped up enforcement of Central Park’s nightly closure after a string of robberies in the late 1990s. Giuliani was so strict about the curfew, he wouldn’t grant an exception for a late-night vigil to John Lennon, despite intercession from the lord mayor of Liverpool on behalf of aggrieved Beatles fans. During the unrest of the past week, police also want bystanders off the street during unrest — and the curfew solves that. “The curfew really is to keep people from coming sort of to gawk at what’s going on and keep the looky-loos away,” said Sacramento City Councilman Steve Hansen, whose city’s 8 p.m. Monday curfew appeared to help prevent the destructive demonstrations from the night before. The curfews also come on the heels of lockdowns and stay-at-home orders imposed during the coronavirus pandemic, making for an unprecedented stretch in cities like New York. In Columbia, South Carolina, officials lifted a weekend curfew and the mayor joined an afternoon protest at the state capitol calling for police reform. But several dozen people stayed for hours after the protest ended as tensions with police grew as shadows got longer. Just before 7:30 p.m. Monday, Columbia, South Carolina , Mayor Steve Benjamin set a curfew for 7:45 p.m. for a small area of downtown and an areas of restaurants and shops. The city sent an emergency notice and protesters looked at their screens as their phones started to buzz and the curfew set in. The protesters immediately started to walk away. But some civil rights organizations think hastily issued curfews are unfair and against the First Amendment of the Constitution. “By making presence on public streets anywhere in these cities unlawful, these measures give police too much discretion over whom to arrest,” said the American Civil Liberties Union of Northern California after a number of cities issued curfews. New York City on Monday found out an unintended consequence of a curfew is keeping away law-abiding protesters. The night before, they banded together to stop vandalism and help police find lawbreakers. It also sends a subtle message, said New York City Council member Ydanis Rodriguez. “Implementing a curfew and increasing the number of police officers patrolling the streets is a tactic to effectively silence the voices raised in protest against the abuse of power and looting of black and colored bodies by members of the police,” Rodriguez said. Curfews can cause other problems too. Charleston, South Carolina, had a curfew for three days after late night Saturday protests led to shattered windows for restaurants and businesses and stolen merchandise downtown. Monday night was quiet. And Charleston Mayor John Tecklenburg said he immediately heard from a certain group of people. “We want to give our businesses a chance to get back into business,” Tecklenburg told his City Council at a Tuesday meeting lifting the curfew. A curfew also allows police to separate people who want to protest while following the law from people who want to cause harm, said Tamara Herold, an assistant professor in the Criminal Justice Department at the University of Nevada-Las Vegas. That makes it easier for law enforcement to decide how to use force to break up unrest. “One of the things police always want to avoid is using indiscriminate force against a large crowd,” Herold said. ___ Associated Press Writers Claudia Lauer and Adam Beam contributed to this report.",0.0

The incident, during which officers used stun guns on the pair and pulled them from their vehicle, received national attention after bystanders recorded and posted video to social media. ""I agree with Mayor [Keisha Lance] Bottoms and I agree with our police chief, Erika Shields, when they both have conveyed in so many separate ways that the conduct in this incident — it is not indicative of the way that we treat people in the city of Atlanta,"" Fulton County, Ga., District Attorney Paul Howard told reporters Tuesday. Howard's office has filed charges — mostly assorted aggravated assault and battery counts — against a half-dozen officers involved in the arrest: Lonnie Hood, Willie Sauls, Ivory Streeter, Mark Gardner, Armond Jones and Roland Claud. Streeter and Gardner have been fired from the force since Saturday's confrontation, while three others have been placed on desk duty. Howard said the charges are backed up by extensive interviews with the young couple, Taniyah Pilgrim and Messiah Young, as well as video evidence from bystanders and the officers' body camera footage. The district attorney played one such video from a bodycam. During the video, officers on foot confront Pilgrim and Young, who had been passing them in a car. After the two black occupants appear to drive away briefly from the officers, Pilgrim and Young stop — at which point the officers swarm the vehicle. Stun guns are used on both occupants, who are ripped from the car over Pilgrim's screams to stop. Pilgrim was never charged; Young was charged with attempting to elude officers before the charge was dismissed at the request of the mayor, who apologized. ""We just need to see that all officers are held accountable, and that there really is change moving forward within the culture of policing,"" Young said at a news conference. Atlanta and other cities have seen widespread protests over the past week after another video — that of George Floyd's arrest in Minneapolis — catalyzed outrage over violence in policing. Floyd died after Derek Chauvin — who has since been fired from the Minneapolis police and charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter — dug a knee into Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes. Video of the incident involving Pilgrim and Young caused a stir of its own.

""But we also understand that the use of excessive force is never acceptable.""  Copyright 2020 NPR. To see more, visit https://www.npr.org. LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST: In dozens of cities yesterday, large, mostly peaceful demonstrations devolved into chaos. In Nashville, Miami, Seattle and Salt Lake City, Pittsburgh, Phoenix, New York and, frankly, too many other places to name, protesters expressed their rage at the death of George Floyd, police brutality and racism. There were violent confrontations with police, and police cracked down, also violently. There were also mass arrests and injuries among demonstrators, journalists and police. At least a dozen major cities declared curfews. Others called on the National Guard, which has been historically used in response to major civil unrest. There were scenes of National Guard marching through some residential neighborhoods, ordering people to stay inside. We go now to Los Angeles, where members of the National Guard were also deployed overnight and a curfew was put in place as a state of emergency was declared. NPR's Nathan Rott is in LA, and he joins us now. Nate, walk us through what happened yesterday. NATHAN ROTT, BYLINE: So there was a massive peaceful protest that started around noon yesterday. It was in the Fairfax district in west L.A., which is kind of a trendy neighborhood with high-end retail and a big outdoor mall. And people were protesting against police violence, as they are all over the country. They were memorializing George Floyd, the black man who died after being pinned to the ground by Minneapolis police officers. And, you know, by all accounts, it was peaceful, respectful until a little later in the afternoon, when we started seeing reports of police cars being set on fire and just a total breakdown in the situation. GARCIA-NAVARRO: This often happens at protests, right? When things shift as things go into the night. Do we know what happened? ROTT: Yeah. And that - honestly, that was a little surprising, Lulu. Usually, these, like, shifts do happen at night. And this started in broad daylight in mid-afternoon, which is, I think, very concerning to a lot of the city officials. So, you know, on social media, people were blaming the police for escalating tensions, for responding with tear gas and the sort of militarized riot gear that has become so commonplace around the country. City officials have so far blamed bad eggs in the crowd for setting things off, and that's something we've been hearing in a lot of places - that it's a small group of people who are agitating these situations. Of course, that's now been politicized, even with the U.S. attorney general blaming anarchists and leftists without, you know, providing any proof of that. But it's really hard to say what makes this situations shift. Tensions are obviously very high, so it doesn't take much to spark something. GARCIA-NAVARRO: No, it doesn't. We saw videos of looting and fires in many cities around the country last night. That was also the case in LA, right? ROTT: Yeah. A number of retail stores in that Fairfax area were broken into. Goods were stolen. Some were set on fire. I know firefighters were dealing with those fires throughout the night. That prompted LA's mayor, Eric Garcetti, to announce a citywide curfew, which caught a lot of people off guard because he announced it an hour before it went into effect. But here he is explaining why they did it and alluding to violent protests in 1992 following Rodney King. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ERIC GARCETTI: We've seen this before in Los Angeles. When the violence escalates, no one wins. And so everybody has to be responsible for owning this moment. Whether you wear a badge or whether you hold a sign, I'm asking all of Los Angeles to take a deep breath and to step back for a moment. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Does it seem like the curfew worked briefly? ROTT: Yeah, the crowds started to thin out even before the curfew started. I know in other parts of the state - Sacramento, San Diego - there were large confrontations between crowds and police. I think, you know, it's going to be interesting to see what happens over the next couple of days. GARCIA-NAVARRO: That's NPR's Nate Rott in LA. Thank you so much. ROTT: Yeah. Thank you, Lulu.

LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST: In dozens of cities yesterday, large, mostly peaceful demonstrations devolved into chaos. In Nashville, Miami, Seattle and Salt Lake City, Pittsburgh, Phoenix, New York and, frankly, too many other places to name, protesters expressed their rage at the death of George Floyd, police brutality and racism. There were violent confrontations with police, and police cracked down, also violently. There were also mass arrests and injuries among demonstrators, journalists and police. At least a dozen major cities declared curfews. Others called on the National Guard, which has been historically used in response to major civil unrest. There were scenes of National Guard marching through some residential neighborhoods, ordering people to stay inside. We go now to Los Angeles, where members of the National Guard were also deployed overnight and a curfew was put in place as a state of emergency was declared. NPR's Nathan Rott is in LA, and he joins us now. Nate, walk us through what happened yesterday. NATHAN ROTT, BYLINE: So there was a massive peaceful protest that started around noon yesterday. It was in the Fairfax district in west L.A., which is kind of a trendy neighborhood with high-end retail and a big outdoor mall. And people were protesting against police violence, as they are all over the country. They were memorializing George Floyd, the black man who died after being pinned to the ground by Minneapolis police officers. And, you know, by all accounts, it was peaceful, respectful until a little later in the afternoon, when we started seeing reports of police cars being set on fire and just a total breakdown in the situation. GARCIA-NAVARRO: This often happens at protests, right? When things shift as things go into the night. Do we know what happened? ROTT: Yeah. And that - honestly, that was a little surprising, Lulu. Usually, these, like, shifts do happen at night. And this started in broad daylight in mid-afternoon, which is, I think, very concerning to a lot of the city officials. So, you know, on social media, people were blaming the police for escalating tensions, for responding with tear gas and the sort of militarized riot gear that has become so commonplace around the country. City officials have so far blamed bad eggs in the crowd for setting things off, and that's something we've been hearing in a lot of places - that it's a small group of people who are agitating these situations. Of course, that's now been politicized, even with the U.S. attorney general blaming anarchists and leftists without, you know, providing any proof of that. But it's really hard to say what makes this situations shift. Tensions are obviously very high, so it doesn't take much to spark something. GARCIA-NAVARRO: No, it doesn't. We saw videos of looting and fires in many cities around the country last night. That was also the case in LA, right? ROTT: Yeah. A number of retail stores in that Fairfax area were broken into. Goods were stolen. Some were set on fire. I know firefighters were dealing with those fires throughout the night. That prompted LA's mayor, Eric Garcetti, to announce a citywide curfew, which caught a lot of people off guard because he announced it an hour before it went into effect. But here he is explaining why they did it and alluding to violent protests in 1992 following Rodney King. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ERIC GARCETTI: We've seen this before in Los Angeles. When the violence escalates, no one wins. And so everybody has to be responsible for owning this moment. Whether you wear a badge or whether you hold a sign, I'm asking all of Los Angeles to take a deep breath and to step back for a moment. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Does it seem like the curfew worked briefly? ROTT: Yeah, the crowds started to thin out even before the curfew started. I know in other parts of the state - Sacramento, San Diego - there were large confrontations between crowds and police. I think, you know, it's going to be interesting to see what happens over the next couple of days. GARCIA-NAVARRO: That's NPR's Nate Rott in LA. Thank you so much. ROTT: Yeah. Thank you, Lulu.

Protesters marched from a downtown Houston park to City Hall where, at a rally that lasted a little over an hour, various local and congressional officials, activists and members of Floyd’s family spoke. Mayor Sylvester Turner told the crowd that the rally and march were about “lifting up the family of George Floyd.” “Today we want to love on them. We want them to know that George did not die in vain,” he said. Turner said about 16 members of Floyd’s family participated in the march and rally. Several members of Floyd’s family spoke at the rally, telling protesters of their appreciation for their support and asking them to not be violent in any protests in which they participated. Before the start of the Houston march, Houston rapper Bun B, who organized the event with fellow Houston rapper Trae Tha Truth, told the crowd the march and rally would be peaceful and he asked the crowd to look out for anybody who could cause trouble. Bun B then led the crowd of at least several thousand on a chant as he said “What’s his name?” and the crowd replied, “George Floyd.” “That’s right and don’t you ever forget it,” Bun B said. Police officers lined the route of the march and large city dump trucks blocked some downtown streets. Afterward, Police Chief Art Acevedo told the crowd to not let violence hijack their peaceful protests. ADVERTISEMENTSkip ................................................................ “God as my witness, change is coming,” Acevedo said regarding the impact of Floyd’s death. “And we’re going to do it the right way.” Former President George W. Bush criticized any effort to squelch protests of George Floyd’s death while in Minneapolis police custody. In a statement issued Tuesday by his office in Dallas, the former Republican president said he and wife Laura Bush “are anguished by the brutal suffocation of George Floyd and disturbed by the injustice and fear that suffocate our country.” “It is a strength when protesters, protected by responsible law enforcement, march for a better future. … Those who set out to silence those voices do not understand the meaning of America — or how it becomes a better place,” he said. In Dallas, protesters assembled outside Dallas City Hall as Abbott met inside with local officials. The governor condemned Floyd’s death as a “horrific act of police brutality” and called Texas a leader in criminal justice reform and mentioned the Sandra Bland Act passed in 2017. The law mandates police deescalation training and is named after a black woman who died in a Texas jail following a confrontational traffic stop with a white state trooper. Video of the traffic stop and her death stirred national outrage. Abbott did not suggest any changes to Texas policing or laws in the wake of Floyd’s death, and Democrats criticized his words as insufficient. More than 3,000 state troopers have been assigned across Texas to bolster local law enforcement amid the protests. Since Friday, there have been nearly 880 arrests during protests in Dallas, according to police and the county sheriff’s office. Of those, 674 people were arrested Monday during a largely peaceful protest that police ended after the group marched onto a bridge. The protesters in that mass arrest were charged with obstructing a roadway but released without being sent to jail, police spokeswoman Tamika Dameron said. Dallas officials expanded a 7 p.m.-6 a.m. curfew zone Tuesday to include the bridge where the Monday night mass arrest happened. No expiration date has been set for the curfew, which covers central Dallas and some adjoining neighborhoods. Austin police say a 20-year-old black protester was critically injured after being struck by a beanbag fired by a police officer. Police Chief Brian Manley says the officer had been aiming at another demonstrator but missed. ___ Stengle reported from Dallas. Associated Press writers Paul J. Weber in Austin and Jake Bleiberg in Dallas also contributed to this report.",0.0

We will not support a platform that incites violence, racism and lives hashtag black lives matter. Frank told CNBC the companies were in final negotiations on a six figure content partnership is at his company would have netted hundreds of thousands of dollars in the deal, which would have provided free therapy to some users. But Frank said he'd be willing to reopen discussions if Facebook improved its methods for moderating content. In the wake of the protests surrounding George Floyd's death, Trump shared a post saying. When the looting starts, the shooting starts. Twitter added labels saying it violated Twitter's rules about glorifying violence and move. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg openly disagreed with telling Fox News. I just believe strongly that Facebook shouldn't be the arbitrator of truth of everything that people say online. On Monday, there was a virtual walk out among Facebook employees who felt Trump's post violated their platform standards Advertisement Tensions rise among Facebook staff as Mark Zuckerberg gives explanation for inaction on President Trump posts Share Shares Copy Link Copy Video above: Facebook loses deal over its reaction to trump ‘looting’ post, employees stage virtual walkoutFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg sought Tuesday to ease employee outrage over his inaction on incendiary remarks recently posted by President Donald Trump.During a company-wide town hall, Zuckerberg struggled to explain his decision-making process as many of his employees, using a real-time feedback tool, reminded him of promises to remove content that calls for violence or that could lead to imminent physical harm.""It's crystal clear today that leadership refuses to stand with us,"" Brandon Dail, an engineer at Facebook, tweeted as the town hall was taking place.Facebook spokesman Andy Stone said in a statement to CNN Business that open and honest discussion ""has always been a part of Facebook's culture.""""Mark had an open discussion with employees today, as he has regularly over the years,"" Stone said. ""He's grateful for their feedback.""The meeting has threatened to ratchet up tensions at Facebook, which has been hit with allegations of right-wing bias from conservatives and criticized by others for tacitly condoning the spread of hate and racism.Another Facebook employee told CNN Business they found Zuckerberg's answers to staff questions at the town hall lacking, and said the CEO risked alienating more of his staff rather than addressing their concerns.During the event, Facebook staff shared links to a video of an exchange between Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Zuckerberg last October when he said: ""If anyone, including a politician, is saying things that can cause, that is calling for violence or could risk imminent physical harm ... we will take that content down.""At one point, roughly 22,000 people had tuned into the live video feed, according to another Facebook worker who was watching the stream. The figure reflects nearly half of the company's 48,000 employees.The top question for Zuckerberg, which called for changes to the company's stance on political speech, received more than 5,400 votes from workers, the employee said.Not all employees disagree with Zuckerberg's position, however. One told CNN Business, ""Supporting free speech - especially when you vehemently disagree with what the person is saying - is a hard but important stance needed to make sure everyone can have a voice.""The employee said it is hard to be sure what portion of Facebook's staff supports Zuckerberg's decision. At least a few people with whom they have spoken do support it but are nervous to say so more publicly because they have seen the pushback within the company, the employee said.Tuesday's event follows days of employee activism over Facebook's handling of Trump's content.Some staffers staged a virtual walkout on Monday to protest decisions made by the company's leaders concerning posts by Trump. And at least one worker, software engineer Timothy Aveni, has quit his job, saying it is no longer feasible to ""keep excusing Facebook's behavior.""Facebook's workforce is known for keeping its disputes with executives largely private. But that changed on Friday, when Zuckerberg announced he would not act against content by Trump that Twitter had flagged earlier as having violated its own rules. The decision has prompted widespread criticism within Facebook that has spilled into public, with numerous employees expressing their disagreement on Twitter.One of Trump's posts had claimed, in reference to the demonstrations in Minneapolis, that ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts"" — a phrase with racist origins. Trump later professed not to know the history of the phrase, but he allowed the original remark to stand on Facebook and Twitter.Zuckerberg said the content provoked in him a ""visceral negative reaction."" But he justified his decision not to act against the posts, citing his responsibility as the ""leader of an institution committed to free expression.""In the eyes of his harshest internal critics, Zuckerberg had simply caved on prior principled commitments.""Mark can patch this one section of Facebook's policies, but if he derives his principle from the particular actions he wants to take, instead of taking action based on principle, it'll be fruitless in the long run,"" Aveni said in response to a CNN reporter's question on his post.",0.0

Both Nair and Mayor Tim Keller stressed that they considered every option and consulted with the Police Department and the governor after demonstrators smashed windows, set fires and vandalized businesses Downtown early Monday. No injuries have been reported, and two men were arrested on misdemeanor charges of unlawful assembly. “Obviously, not taking action, we can’t have that, and we will not have that,” Keller said. “But we also don’t want to take too much action or we will end up like a bunch of other cities. … We don’t feel like we need to do a curfew at this time or bring in the National Guard … but, of course, we will if we think we need to.” Police Chief Michael Geier said the Albuquerque Police Department didn’t have a lot of time to prepare before the first protest, on Thursday, but since then they have been making adjustments and talking with the organizers. He said the department has also beefed up its response in partnership with other agencies, including the Bernalillo County Sheriff’s Office and New Mexico State Police. But he said that the chaos that ensued Downtown a couple of hours after a peaceful march concluded Sunday night caught his officers off guard and that some had already gone home. By the time the officers were called back and set up again, a lot of the damage to businesses had already been done, Geier said. “We got caught behind a power curve on that because we weren’t prepared,” he said. “But had that situation been part of a splinter group that broke off during the peaceful one, we would have had more than enough resources to be prepared for that.” He said so far they don’t think a militarized response beyond the line of officers with riot gear, helmets and batons is necessary. The Emergency Response Team descended on the demonstrators Downtown and eventually dispersed them using tear gas. But if the city imposes a curfew, Geier said, it will be nearly impossible to enforce. “If there are 200 people out there, I can guarantee you we won’t arrest 200 people; it’s almost impossible, we could not manage that,” Geier said. “Once they call our bluff, there are more people that are going to come out and challenge us.” Instead, Nair said, officials are monitoring the protests, blocking streets to Downtown and working on de-escalation. Monday night’s protest, in which hundreds of demonstrators took to the streets in the pouring rain to march up and down Central, never made it Downtown because APD had blocked all the entrances. The march was peaceful for its duration. “I watched the cameras all night,” Nair said. “It was empty. The only people trying to navigate those roadblocks were people who were trying to get home. So we essentially did curtail movement and activity around Downtown last night, but also without doing anything as extreme as a curfew, and it worked.”",0.0

Their right to assemble peacefully and mourn the lives lost while seeking changes to a broken system – without fear of retaliation. And without uncalled-for displays of military “dominance.” New Mexicans have, by and large, been exercising their right to protest in a peaceful manner, and we believe our state and local law enforcement officials can and should work with their communities to keep protesters safe while holding any bad actors and outside agitators accountable for unlawful activities. We reject the president’s call for military intervention and instead ask that his attention be focused on healing our nation. Americans are looking to our leaders for real solutions. Solutions that uphold our Constitutional Rights. Solutions that protect both citizens and police while ending violence in our streets. And solutions that begin to restore the broken trust between the brave men and women of law enforcement and the communities they serve. New Mexico can and should lead by example.”",0.0

While the seeds of this suffering were planted hundreds of years ago, it has been heartbreaking to see the impact on those countless individuals whose lives have been irreversibly changed by these events. The rest of us have been relegated to the role of bystander, with a sense of great sadness, frustration, hopelessness and helplessness as we watch parts of our cities come apart. This social unrest comes at a time when our nation was already struggling with the tragedy that COVID-19 has claimed the lives of more than 100,000 of our family members, friends and community members. It is only natural that such trying times would have an impact on our collective psyche. For those more intimately involved, the impact might be quite severe and pervasive. However, even those indirectly following news cycles and social media may be experiencing emotional distress. We have seen this live on TV, as some reporters have broken into tears while struggling to process the events they are covering. Typical reactions to social unrest include anxiety, sadness and despair. Some individuals may worry that the violence will spread to directly their loved ones, while others may have more existential worries about their communities recovering and the future of our world. Many will feel a sense of sadness to the point of bereavement in grieving the loss of the country that they thought they had, or for the families who have lost loved ones. Hopelessness or despair often accompanies intense anxiety and sadness when people feel powerless and a lack of control over their environment. Another typical reaction to social unrest is frustration and irritability, which if left unchecked, can progress to anger, hatred, black-and-white thinking, dehumanization, thoughts of revenge – and ultimately more violence. While it is important to acknowledge these feelings within ourselves, anger and hatred only serve to further divide, worsen existing tensions and ultimately leave everybody involved feeling much worse in the end. The deceptive thing about anger is that it gives people a false sense of control that they do not feel with fear, anxiety, depression, despair and hopelessness. However, this is an illusion, as it is very fleeting and only ends up perpetuating the cycle of pain and suffering. We should resist the impulse to choose sides amid a a media climate that feeds off polarization. We would do well to remember that pain and suffering do not discriminate and affect everyone. What can we do to improve our emotional well-being during such disturbing times? The first and most practical thing is to limit our exposure to traumatic and provocative media content. We might need to follow such coverage to ensure our safety, particularly if we are traveling through areas of social unrest. But in all other circumstances it does little good to view media coverage more than once a day. We should seek neutrally reported news coverage as much as possible to avoid excessive polarization. It is also very important to find physical outlets for our mental and emotional stress. These could include cardiovascular exercise, weight training, cross training or hikes in nature. Some forms of exercise include creative and/or spiritual aspects, such as dance and yoga, and these could have additional benefits beyond physical fitness. Many people will experience insomnia or other sleep-related difficulties during these times. Sleep is a critical aspect of our wellness, as it restores homeostasis and provides us with a critical reprieve from the fight-or-flight cycle of stress hormones during difficult times. You may need to see a medical expert if you are unable to sleep using relaxation techniques, warm showers or drinks, or other natural methods. It is also important to continue taking care of our bodies in terms of nutrition and hydration. Beyond our individual selves, it is also important for us to continue having healthy connections with the world around us. These human interactions are not only important to a healthy and full life, but they also restore our faith in humanity. The greatest antidote to a feeling of powerlessness is advocacy. This may be a great time for us to re-evaluate our lives and ask ourselves if we are doing enough to better our communities. We know that there are people in our community who are suffering. What are we doing to help them? What are we doing to ensure they do not feel left out, unheard, unseen and forgotten? The seeds of this unrest may have been planted centuries ago, yet we can begin planting new seeds of love, resilience, togetherness, healing, wellness, unity and growth. Doing so will have the dual benefit of helping us at an individual level and also benefitting the world around us.",0.0

The Ethical Society of Police, which represents black officers in ST Louis, says Dorn was the type of brother that would have given his life to save them if he had. Too many of us younger officers looked up to him. He retired probably in 2004 so very well, like not very pleasant, and his wife still works here and a very sad time for our agency.

No arrests have been made.The shooting and theft apparently was posted on Facebook Live, but the video has since been taken down. It came on a violent night in St. Louis, where four officers were shot, officers were pelted with rocks and fireworks and 55 businesses were burglarized or damaged, including a convenience store that burned. Police also shot and gravely injured a burglary suspect who they say shot at officers.Cities across the U.S. have seen protests and violence since George Floyd died May 25 after a white Minneapolis officer pressed his knee into Floyd's neck for several minutes even after the handcuffed black man stopped moving and pleaded for air.Dorn, who was black, was a friend of the pawn shop’s owner and frequently checked on the business when alarms went off, his wife, St. Louis police Sgt.

He then became chief of Moline Acres, a small town in St. Louis County.Former St. Louis County police Chief Tim Fitch knew Dorn for 30 years and said they became close friends when Dorn and his wife were leading the St. Louis police department's Explorers program for young people interested in law enforcement careers, while Fitch was leading the county's program.“He was very dedicated to youth, especially disadvantaged youth,"" said Fitch, who led the St. Louis County Police Department from 2009 to 2014. “He wanted to see them succeed. He wanted to be a role model for those young men and women to go into law enforcement.”Dorn' s personality was “bigger than life,” Fitch said. ""He was a fun guy, a happy guy. You never had to wonder what he was thinking when somebody did something incredibly stupid like a crime because he would just say it as he saw it.”When he took over as chief in Moline Acres, Dorn made it clear that his officers would be held to the strictest of standards, Fitch said.“He wanted them to do the right thing all the time,"" Fitch said.The Ethical Society of Police, which represents black officers in St. Louis, said in a news release that Dorn was “the type of brother that would’ve given his life to save them if he had to.”St. Louis police Chief John Hayden called Dorn a ""fine captain.”“Many of us, the other officers, looked up to him,” Hayden said.

CHICAGO (AP) — In the days since President Donald Trump blamed antifa activists for an eruption of violence at protests over police killings of black people, social media has lit up with false rumors that the far-left-leaning group is transporting people to wreak havoc on small cities across America. The speculation was being raised by conservative news outlets and pro-Trump social media accounts, as well as impostor Facebook and Twitter accounts. Twitter and Facebook busted some of the instigators behind the unsubstantiated social media chatter. Twitter determined Monday that a tweet promising antifa would “move into residential areas” and “white” neighborhoods was sent by the white supremacy group Identity Evropa. The tweet was shared hundreds of times and cited in online news articles before Twitter removed it Monday, a company spokesperson said. Yet the tweet continued to circulate Tuesday on Facebook and Instagram. Facebook, using information shared by Twitter, announced Tuesday night it also took down a handful of accounts on its platform that were created by white supremacy groups like Identity Evropa and American Guard, some of them posing as part of the antifa movement. For years, some social media users have tried to delegitimize controversial or political protests with baseless theories that they were organized by wealthy financiers or extremists organizations. Over the weekend, Trump singled out antifa as being responsible for the violent protests triggered by the killing of George Floyd, saying in a tweet: “It’s ANTIFA and the Radical Left.” “Usually you see this when there’s an interest to deflect conversations from protests to just accusing the protests of being violent, organized or having backers that are evil,”said Filippo Menczer, a professor of informatics and computer science at Indiana University. “The president mentioning it, of course, has generated a huge spike.” The theories about antifa — short for “anti-fascists” and an umbrella term for lefitst militant groups that confront or resist neo-Nazis and white supremacists at demonstrations — have trickled through cities across the country in recent days. Police departments say people are phoning in “tips” they see on social media claiming antifa is sending buses or even planes full of antifa activists to their area. In Payette County, Idaho — a rural county of 24,000 — the calls started early Monday morning after one Facebook user said the sheriff had spotted antifa rioters in the area. The calls didn’t taper off until the sheriff’s office debunked the rumor on Facebook. “It’s really a small community, where our citizens know us pretty well,” said Payette County Sheriff Lt. Andy Creech. “When the post got out there, we started getting phone calls directly.” Meanwhile, Facebook users were also warning their friends to stay clear of a shopping center in a New Jersey suburb, saying it would be the center of antifa destruction on Tuesday. But police had “no credible information” that antifa would be present in the area, Toms River Police Department media specialist Jillian Messina said in an email. The police aren’t aware of anyone showing up at all, she added. Identical Facebook and Twitter posts about busloads of antifa protesters also stumped the Sioux Falls Police Department, where officers in the South Dakota city said they didn’t see any unusual bus activity in town. But the claims still spread for days ahead of a planned protest this Saturday, said Sam Clemens, a public information officer for the department. “Everyone heard there were going to be buses of people,” Clemens said. “It was very specific: there were three busloads.” Even the owner of a Michigan limousine business was forced to refute online rumors when two of his buses became the center of a conspiracy theory that liberal financier George Soros was funneling protesters to Milan, Michigan. Social media users widely shared a manipulated photo of his white buses, edited to show the words “Soros Riot Dance squad” emblazoned on the sides. The buses belong to Sean Duval, the owner of local transportation company Golden Limousine International, and don’t have any words printed on them. Said Duval: “It’s frustrating when people from the outside start instigating and try to turn American against American.” ___ Associated Press writers Barbara Ortutay in Oakland, Calif., Beatrice Dupuy in New York and Ali Swenson in Seattle contributed to this report.",0.0

NEW YORK (AP) — An 8 p.m. curfew didn’t stop thousands of defiant demonstrators from marching through the streets of New York City throughout the night Tuesday, though some of the rampant destruction seen over the past few nights was quelled. The citywide curfew, which is in place through Sunday, was instated to prevent the widespread damage and destruction that has filled the city’s streets over the last two nights after largely peaceful dayside protests. Mayor Bill de Blasio doubled down on the citywide curfew, but rejected urging from President Donald Trump and an offer from Gov. Andrew Cuomo to bring in the National Guard. “Everyone, time to go home so we can keep people safe,” he said on WINS-AM radio shortly after the curfew took effect. But demonstrators continued winding through the streets, as part of ongoing nationwide protests following the May 25 death of George Floyd, a black man who died last week after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed a knee on Floyd’s neck even after he stopped moving and pleading for air. “I’m surprised,” said Risha Munoz, on Manhattan’s Upper West Side, where at points they were greeted with cheers and horns by onlookers in building windows. “I didn’t think they were gonna let us go on, but we just kept on moving and we’re not stopping.” “Something has to break, and it’s not going to be us,” said Evan Kutcher, one of hundreds of demonstrators who stood outside the Barclays Center chanting Floyd’s name Tuesday evening. Police began making arrests around 9 p.m. and shut down parts of the West Side Highway in lower Manhattan, blocking it off to huge crowds of protesters. The police department announced it would not allow vehicle traffic south of 96th Street in Manhattan after curfew, though residents, essential workers, buses and truck deliveries were exempt. “We’re going to have a tough few days. We’re going to beat it back,” de Blasio, a Democrat, said. Jane Rossi said she witnessed officers rip a man out of his car and arrest him in Chelsea around 10:45 p.m. The car was behind a group of several hundred protesters that had roamed Manhattan peacefully since leaving Trump Tower at 8 p.m. Tensions had risen moments earlier when some in the group began trying to damage a bike rental station and banged on the windows of a JCPenny’s. The vast majority of the crowd moved to stop the them. Officers surrounded the car and arrested the driver moments later. “They were just driving behind the protesters making sure that we were safe,” Rossi said. “They were part of the protest.” NYPD officers forced two Associated Press journalists to stop covering the protests Tuesday night, surrounding them, shoving them and cursing at them while yelling at them to go home. This, despite an order allowing media to remain on city streets. Portions of the incident were captured on camera by videojournalist Robert Bumsted, who was working with photographer Maye-E Wong to document the protests in Manhattan. The video shows more than a half dozen officers confronting the journalists as they filmed and photographed police ordering protesters to go home shortly after the curfew took effect. Just after midnight Wednesday, most of the city’s streets were cleared aside from police patrolling, especially in hot-spot areas for demonstrations in Brooklyn and Manhattan. There was a heavy police presence in the Brooklyn neighborhood of Crown Heights, where authorities say police fatally shot a man after responding to reports of shots fired. NYPD Chief of Department Terence Monahan said the officer-involved shooting was not connected to the protests. __ Contributing were Associated Press writers Michael R.

NEW YORK (AP) — Six of America’s late-night television comedy hosts — five of them white men — turned serious after the nation’s weekend of unrest following the death of George Floyd to suggest they and others need to do more than talk about racism. It has become a ritual — a somewhat inexplicable one, as TBS’ Conan O’Brien noted — for these comics to come on the air after acts of terrorism, school shootings or other national traumas to try and make sense of them for their audiences. Floyd died May 25 after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee into the handcuffed black man’s neck for several minutes, even after he stopped moving. “Today feels very different,” O’Brien said Monday night. “It doesn’t feel right to talk about my feelings of sadness and anger. That truly feels inadequate and somehow wrong.” Instead, O’Brien said it was important to listen to people who have direct experience with “our national crisis,” the fact that much of the black community in the United States doesn’t feel safe, seen or heard. He brought on CNN’s Van Jones as a guest. That’s one thing O’Brien had in common with Stephen Colbert, Jimmy Fallon, James Corden and Seth Meyers: They all invited black guests or, in Corden’s case, collaborator Reggie Watts, to talk about the issue after saying their piece. Trevor Noah of Comedy Central’s “The Daily Show” brought a different personal experience, having grown up in South Africa with a white father and black mother. He offered a serious, expansive monologue that touched upon the coronavirus’ impact on minorities, the New York woman who recently told police she was being threatened by an African American man in Central Park, and George Floyd. To feel threatened by law enforcement feels to many blacks like they’re being held to a standard that some responsible for enforcing laws don’t adhere to themselves, he said. Noah said he understands the mentality that leads to looting when many whites can’t. “Try to imagine how it feels to be a black person when they watch themselves be looted every day,” Noah said, “because that’s what’s happening in America. Police in America are looting black bodies.” NBC’s Fallon, like all of the hosts speaking from home because of COVID-19 restrictions, noted how the Floyd story coincided with his own personal issues. Fallon recently apologized after stories emerged about how he appeared in blackface to impersonate Chris Rock in a 2000 “Saturday Night Live” skit. He said he was advised to keep quiet when people talked about him online, but he realized he had to talk about it. “What that small gesture did for me was break my own silence,” the “Tonight” show host said. “Staying silent was the biggest crime that people like me can do.” “We need to start saying ‘it not OK,’ more than just one day on Twitter,” said Fallon, who later spoke on the air with NAACP President Derrick Johnson. Unlike the others, Colbert and Meyers mixed jokes into their monologues, but there was no mistaking their messages. Denying human rights and dignity for any people will ultimately destroy society, said Colbert, the late-night ratings leader on CBS’ “Late Show,” “Take it upon yourself to be a leader and set an example of the kind of country you want to live in,” he said. “That might mean going down to a protest or making a donation, or having a tense conversation about race. “You’re not going to get that from the White House,” he said. “So we need to step up and provide it ourselves. Because America is officially BYOP, bring your own president.” Meyers was sickened by the amount of money local communities spend on policing. “We spend more on the system that punishes and devalues black lives than we do on the things that reaffirm and value black lives and allows people to live lives of safety, decency and health,” he said. Corden, from Britain, seemed shaken on his CBS show. “I feel hopeless,” he said. “I don’t have the answers. But I do want to do more. I want to learn more and let that be a start.” ABC’s Jimmy Kimmel aired a rerun Monday.",0.0

The two men are certain to face each other on the presidential ballot in November, yet party rules require them first to accumulate a majority of delegates in the months long state-by-state primary season.Trump secured the Republican presidential nomination in March.Pennsylvania, which offered Tuesday's largest trove of delegates, also represented a significant test case for Republicans and Democrats working to strengthen their operations in a premier general election battleground.Voters were forced to brave long lines in “militarized zones” because officials consolidated the vast majority of polling places in Philadelphia to minimize health risks, according to Erin Kramer, executive director of One Pennsylvania. She noted that some polling places in African American communities are in police stations.“Having to stand in line while police officers are entering and exiting the building on police business is not exactly how people want to spend their election day,” Kramer said.Biden was in Philadelphia earlier Tuesday to deliver remarks about the civil unrest that has erupted across the nation after the police killing of George Floyd. He didn’t talk about the primary, instead focusing his attention on Trump, whom Biden blasted as “more interested in power than in principle.”Related video: Joe Biden addresses civil unrest over police brutality of black men and womenVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is not actively campaigning for the Democratic presidential nomination, having suspended his operation and endorsed Biden, but his name appeared on the ballots. On the eve of Tuesday's primaries, senior adviser Jeff Weaver encouraged progressives to vote for Sanders anyway to help maximize his influence in the direction of the Democratic Party.The comments served as a reminder that Biden may have no legitimate Democratic rivals remaining, but he must still win over skeptical activists from his party’s far-left flank, who worry he’s too close to the political establishment.Party unity was an afterthought this week, however, as more immediate health and safety concerns dominated the national conversation. The coronavirus death toll has surged past 100,000 nationwide, and thousands of new cases are reported each day.At the same time, several major cities, particularly Washington, D.C., and Philadelphia among those voting Tuesday, struggled to contain protests and related looting that led to thousands of arrests.Some voters said Trump’s increasingly tough tone toward protesters inspired them to participate in the democratic process. Nicholas Autiello, who works in finance in Rhode Island, said he was disturbed by police driving back peaceful demonstrators near the White House on Monday.“Last night, we have a president who is acting like a dictator,” Autiello said. “So being able to come out here this morning and fill in a circle next to a name for someone who I know will restore honor and decency to the presidency was so important.”Political groups have had to adjust as some states move to a system that relies largely on voting by mail. They include Montana, where all 56 counties decided to vote entirely by mail, despite Trump's repeated warning against it. Voting rights watchdogs in multiple states on Tuesday expressed concerns about access to mail ballots, confusion about deadlines and a shortage of poll workers that led to long lines.Those voting Tuesday included the District of Columbia, Indiana, Maryland, Montana, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and South Dakota. Two other states holding primary elections on Tuesday, Idaho and Iowa, chose their presidential nominee early in the year.“We are in unique times, and voting is a unique challenge for people,” said Josh Schwerin, chief strategist for the pro-Democrat super PAC Priorities USA. He said that his organization and others would be watching closely on Tuesday “to see how well it works, where issues are and where obstacles have been put in place.”",0.0

Hundreds of people gathered at the University of New Mexico Tuesday evening then made their way downtown to Albuquerque Police Department headquarters. APD reports that two groups of protesters gathered for the peaceful protest. About 150 people gathered at UNM while a separate group gathered in the downtown area. The protest remained peaceful with speakers gathering on the steps of the police department to call for police reform and justice for those killed at the hands of law enforcement. APD states that there were no arrests but there was one report of graffiti at a city building downtown. “Our City came together once again in a peaceful protest,” said Chief Mike Geier in a press release. “We want to make sure that our community is able to peacefully lift their voices to reject violence and that is what we saw last night.” “Actually this night is actually very impressive. I had a different ideology about Albuquerque and how everybody was in a bubble and now that I see people out protesting standing with the fight, it makes me have a different idea,” said protester Jermaine Bell. Police say the group of 200 that marched from downtown up Central to UNM where they gathered until around 10 p.m. On Wednesday, the City of Albuquerque will be holding a special meeting to discuss the protests that have been taking place in the community and across the nation.

Mostly peaceful throughout the day, the demonstrators faced police officers, National Guard troops and other forces. President Trump called New York protesters ""lowlifes and losers,"" in a tweet posted Tuesday. Demonstrators throughout the country showed up, even in smaller towns such as Brattleboro, Vt., and Kingman, Ariz. Here are our updates on what is happening around the country: New York City Protesters gathered at places including the Barclays Center, Times Square and at the NYPD headquarters Tuesday, and daytime demonstrations were relatively peaceful. Tuesday was the first day for the citywide 8 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew, which will stay in effect until at least Sunday, the mayor announced. Trump called on the city to bring in the National Guard in a tweet. New York City put on an 11:00 P.M. CURFEW last night. No wonder they ripped the place apart. Should be 7:00 P.M. CALL UP THE NATIONAL GUARD. #SAVENYC — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 2, 2020 Mayor Bill de Blasio responded, ""Thank God we have not had a loss of life in these last 5 days, but you bring outside armed forces into an equation they are not trained for...that is a dangerous scenario."" Police cars and a helicopter converged on one group of marchers blocking an intersection on the Upper East Side around 9 p.m. Protesters chanted ""peaceful protest"" and held their arms up as officers dispersed the crowd. Marchers told NPR they joined the rally in part because of Floyd's death, but also because they're convinced officers around the country are targeting black men. Many businesses were boarded up to prevent a repeat of Monday night's looting. One business owner who stood outside his shop told NPR he was grateful for the heavy police presence. In Times Square, medical workers, who New York residents have cheered on throughout the coronavirus pandemic, came out to support demonstrations.

Sea of protestors demanding cops take a knee, someone bangs on the police van and everyone jumps.

Crowd chanting”let us through” on Manhattan side of bridge pic.twitter.com/R0ieAttU74 — Amy Julia Harris (@amyjharris) June 3, 2020 Once those demonstrators who crossed the bridge attempted to exit and enter Manhattan, a standoff between hundreds of protesters and throngs of police officers took place. Officers blocked demonstrators from leaving, and protesters chanted ""Let us through!"" Los Angeles Angry residents called for Los Angeles Police Department Chief Michel Moore to resign following days of unrest over Floyd's death and multiple complaints of brutality by law enforcement. About 500 participants called to join a police commission meeting, causing connection delays. But after nearly an hour, with technical issues resolved, hundreds more residents were added. Many expressed outrage with Moore and said the department has met demonstrations with an excessive use of force with rubber bullets, tear gas, flash bangs and batons against peaceful and rioting demonstrators alike. Since Monday, Moore has drawn ire following remarks that protesters are ""capitalizing"" on the latest bouts of chaos, although he apologized on the Tuesday morning call, saying he ""misspoke."" ""We will investigate each complaint, and I promise to hold accountable anyone who violates our policy or commits other misconduct,"" Moore said, according to the LA Times. Moore noted there have been 13 officer-involved shootings since the start of the year. He added that more than 2,700 people have been arrested amid the protests — most for ""failure to disperse"" for curfew. Additionally, he said 27 LAPD personnel have been injured, including one hospitalized for a fractured skull and another for a broken knee. It is unclear how many protesters have been injured. Later in the day, more protesters gathered across the sprawling city, including in Hollywood, where armed National Guard members were stationed. About an hour before the countywide curfew went into effect, a massive column of demonstrators marched to Mayor Eric Garcetti's home in Hancock Park, a wealthy neighborhood lined with palm trees and mansions. ""I hear you that this isn't just about the criminal justice system. This is also about society and where we put our resources,"" Garcetti said in a news conference. ""I choose to listen and move forward, and bring this city together to build peace on our streets and in our neighborhoods,"" Garcetti said. ""George Floyd died in our America so that we may make sense of our future to make sure that we never see that again."" Hours past the curfew, demonstrators continued to flout orders to evacuate the streets. Washington, D.C. Large crowds showed up again a day after federal forces used tear gas and rubber bullets on peaceful demonstrators at Lafayette Square, across from the White House. Protesters on Tuesday in Washington, where there was also a primary election, were peaceful. The Washington Post and DCist reported that thousands demonstrated, surpassing Monday's crowd size. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., also joined demonstrators on Tuesday. National Guard troops, the U.S. Park Police and Department of Homeland Security officers stood inside a 7-foot metal fence that was put up overnight and surrounded the perimeter of Lafayette Square, as protesters clung to the outside. At sunset, hundreds lay on the ground face-down at the Capitol, emulating the position in which Minneapolis police held George Floyd before his death. As midnight neared, reporters said large crowds were still protesting peacefully, hours past the city's 7 p.m. curfew. This is a developing story. Some things reported by the media will later turn out to be wrong. We will focus on reports from officials and other authorities, credible news outlets and reporters who are at the scene. We will update as the situation develops. ",0.0

This comes after President Trump told governors that they have to ""dominate,"" and encouraged them to activate the national guard because of the nation wide unrest over George Floyd's death, a black man killed at the hands of Minneapolis police.""Curfews can often have a reverse effect,"" Keller said. ""One, there's a psychological challenge.

While the city does have the resources to implement a curfew, Keller said what we're seeing coming from other cities is just more violence. ""We certainly look at other cities, and again the cities that have taken a stronger stance have actually literally paid for it in property damage and in serious injury,"" he said. In other cities, it's been reported that police are targeting people not actually involved in the protests or riots.""It's a complete misuse of resources to be dealing with people coming home from the grocery store, and it just creates more anger in the community,"" Keller said. If our police truly do become overwhelmed at some point or if our city turns to chaos, Keller said he will take action and impose a curfew.

We will not support a platform that incites violence, racism and lives hashtag black lives matter. Frank told CNBC the companies were in final negotiations on a six figure content partnership is at his company would have netted hundreds of thousands of dollars in the deal, which would have provided free therapy to some users. But Frank said he'd be willing to reopen discussions if Facebook improved its methods for moderating content. In the wake of the protests surrounding George Floyd's death, Trump shared a post saying. When the looting starts, the shooting starts. Twitter added labels saying it violated Twitter's rules about glorifying violence and move. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg openly disagreed with telling Fox News. I just believe strongly that Facebook shouldn't be the arbitrator of truth of everything that people say online. On Monday, there was a virtual walk out among Facebook employees who felt Trump's post violated their platform standards Advertisement Tensions rise among Facebook staff as Mark Zuckerberg gives explanation for inaction on President Trump posts Share Shares Copy Link Copy Video above: Facebook loses deal over its reaction to trump ‘looting’ post, employees stage virtual walkoutFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg sought Tuesday to ease employee outrage over his inaction on incendiary remarks recently posted by President Donald Trump.During a company-wide town hall, Zuckerberg struggled to explain his decision-making process as many of his employees, using a real-time feedback tool, reminded him of promises to remove content that calls for violence or that could lead to imminent physical harm.""It's crystal clear today that leadership refuses to stand with us,"" Brandon Dail, an engineer at Facebook, tweeted as the town hall was taking place.Facebook spokesman Andy Stone said in a statement to CNN Business that open and honest discussion ""has always been a part of Facebook's culture.""""Mark had an open discussion with employees today, as he has regularly over the years,"" Stone said. ""He's grateful for their feedback.""The meeting has threatened to ratchet up tensions at Facebook, which has been hit with allegations of right-wing bias from conservatives and criticized by others for tacitly condoning the spread of hate and racism.Another Facebook employee told CNN Business they found Zuckerberg's answers to staff questions at the town hall lacking, and said the CEO risked alienating more of his staff rather than addressing their concerns.During the event, Facebook staff shared links to a video of an exchange between Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Zuckerberg last October when he said: ""If anyone, including a politician, is saying things that can cause, that is calling for violence or could risk imminent physical harm ... we will take that content down.""At one point, roughly 22,000 people had tuned into the live video feed, according to another Facebook worker who was watching the stream. The figure reflects nearly half of the company's 48,000 employees.The top question for Zuckerberg, which called for changes to the company's stance on political speech, received more than 5,400 votes from workers, the employee said.Not all employees disagree with Zuckerberg's position, however. One told CNN Business, ""Supporting free speech - especially when you vehemently disagree with what the person is saying - is a hard but important stance needed to make sure everyone can have a voice.""The employee said it is hard to be sure what portion of Facebook's staff supports Zuckerberg's decision. At least a few people with whom they have spoken do support it but are nervous to say so more publicly because they have seen the pushback within the company, the employee said.Tuesday's event follows days of employee activism over Facebook's handling of Trump's content.Some staffers staged a virtual walkout on Monday to protest decisions made by the company's leaders concerning posts by Trump. And at least one worker, software engineer Timothy Aveni, has quit his job, saying it is no longer feasible to ""keep excusing Facebook's behavior.""Facebook's workforce is known for keeping its disputes with executives largely private. But that changed on Friday, when Zuckerberg announced he would not act against content by Trump that Twitter had flagged earlier as having violated its own rules. The decision has prompted widespread criticism within Facebook that has spilled into public, with numerous employees expressing their disagreement on Twitter.One of Trump's posts had claimed, in reference to the demonstrations in Minneapolis, that ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts"" — a phrase with racist origins. Trump later professed not to know the history of the phrase, but he allowed the original remark to stand on Facebook and Twitter.Zuckerberg said the content provoked in him a ""visceral negative reaction."" But he justified his decision not to act against the posts, citing his responsibility as the ""leader of an institution committed to free expression.""In the eyes of his harshest internal critics, Zuckerberg had simply caved on prior principled commitments.""Mark can patch this one section of Facebook's policies, but if he derives his principle from the particular actions he wants to take, instead of taking action based on principle, it'll be fruitless in the long run,"" Aveni said in response to a CNN reporter's question on his post.",0.0

Wait, I get it. The nationwide calls for justice, as Floyd's death was ruled, a homicide by both the Hennepin County Medical examiner and in an independent autopsy authorized by the family. The autopsy shows that Mr Floyd had no underlying medical problem that caused or contributed to his death. Cause of death, in my opinion, is that's fix CIA due to compression of the neck. But the Hennepin County medical examiner released its summary, saying Floyd died of cardiopulmonary arrest without explaining what caused his heart to stop overnight curfews enforced in cities in at least 20 states in Washington, D. C. And many stayed out late into the night instead of going home. Protests were largely peaceful across the nation and that some marches policed even joining the people in solidarity like in Atlanta, where some officers were seen taking a knee before renewed violence. But unrest and clashes between authorities and demonstrators were on display in many cities. Police firing tear gas into this crowd of protesters in Philadelphia, sending them scrambling off the highway. In Washington, a chaotic scene as police cleared this peaceful protest outside the White House has thousands of demonstrators marched together in New York City. Others looted some of midtown Manhattan's most iconic stores. Similar scenes playing out in Los Angeles with businesses broken into. Earlier in Minneapolis, Terrence Floyd for the first time visiting the very location, his brother took his last breaths, overwhelmed with emotion before saying this to Demonstrators. If I'm not over here wiling out, I'm not over here, woman up stuff. If I'm not only messing up my community, no, what you are doing, What are you doing?

Protests have been largely peaceful.Many cities across the U.S. have enacted curfews, such as in Los Angeles where the curfew is the harshest since the riots in 1992, and New York City has announced its strictest curfew since 1943. Six Atlanta police officers have been charged after a dramatic video showed authorities pulling two young people from a car during protests over the death of George Floyd.The state of Minnesota filed a human rights complaint Tuesday against the Minneapolis Police Department in Floyd's death.Joe Biden mounted one of his most aggressive attacks against President Donald Trump on Tuesday, deriding the commander in chief's disregard of core constitutional values and blistering him for being “more interested in power, than in principle.” NEW YORK —Thousands of demonstrators protesting the death of George Floyd remained on New York City streets on Tuesday after an 8 p.m. curfew put in place by officials struggling to stanch destruction and growing complaints that the nation’s biggest city was reeling out of control night after night.Mayor Bill de Blasio had doubled down on a citywide curfew, moving it up from 11 p.m. a night earlier, but rejected urging from President Donald Trump and an offer from Gov. Andrew Cuomo to bring in the National Guard.Protests had resumed Tuesday during the day over the death of Floyd, a black man who died on May 25 after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed a knee on his neck even after he stopped moving and pleading for air.People marched in groups of thousands in parts of Manhattan and Brooklyn, as merchants boarded up their businesses. As the the curfew time arrived, many were still in the streets and continued marching, with officers initially standing by and allowing them.But officers started ordering people to move along, and began taking people into custody. Demonstrators who had been on the West Side Highway in lower Manhattan were herded off, with parts of the roadway blocked off behind them.“Something has to break, and it’s not going to be us,” said Evan Kutcher, one of hundreds of demonstrators who stood outside the Barclays Center chanting Floyd’s name Tuesday evening. “We’re here because something needs to change.MINNEAPOLIS — Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, who is taking over the prosecution in George Floyd's death, said Monday night that he will ""hold everyone accountable.""""I can assure you we are taking a fresh look,"" Ellison told CNN. ""We plan to hold everyone accountable who is legally culpable,"" he said, explaining that while he has spent the last 24 hours reviewing evidence, he cannot ethically comment as a prosecutor.""We are looking very carefully at holding everybody accountable who failed to do their duty and fell below the legal requirements of their position, or did something affirmatively that would be in violation of the law,"" Ellison said.""When we are ready, and that won't be long from now, we plan on taking the proper and deliberate action,"" he said.He said earlier in the day that he'd move as ""quickly and effectively"" as possible.""I need to protect this prosecution,"" he told CNN. ""I am not going to create a situation where people can say this was a rush to judgment.""On Sunday, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz announced that Ellison, the former congressman who ran for chair of the Democratic National Committee in 2017, will take the lead in the case of Floyd's killing.WASHINGTON D.C. — The U.S. Park Police is denying it used tear gas to disperse a crowd of protesters outside the White House on Monday night, saying officers instead used smoke canisters and pepper balls to aggressively push back the demonstrators.Protesters scrambled as smoke filled the streets and AP journalists witnessed people reacting to their eyes and throats becoming irritated. Journalists covering the protest reported the crowd was largely peaceful at the time; the Park Police said they were responding to protesters throwing items, including bricks and frozen water bottles at law enforcement.Justice Department officials offered a different explanation, saying officers were carrying out Attorney General William Barr’s order to expand the security perimeter outside the White House.Officers repelled the crowd nearly 30 minutes ahead of a 7 p.m. curfew in Washington. Shortly after the crowd was pushed back, President Donald Trump walked through the park where they had gathered for a photo opportunity at a nearby church.--------------Hundreds of people were gathered peacefully tonight at the base of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C. — a mix of black and white, young and old, looked out toward the Washington Monument.Several dozen uniformed guardsmen and women, along with Park Police, were standing on the steps of the monument.There were speakers and prayers and signs, calling for justice and an end to police brutality.“Together we are more,” a speaker said.On a breezy spring evening in Washington, this scene illustrates the peaceful demonstration that is starkly at odds with violent rioting and looting.“Make it quick,” one man said, “curfew is coming up in 30 minutes.”The peaceful demonstration concluded when the 7 p.m. curfew in D.C. went into effect.ATLANTA — Six Atlanta police officers are being charged with using excessive force during an arrest of two college students at a protest on Saturday night, Fulton County District Attorney Paul Howard announced Tuesday.The officers were filmed in downtown Atlanta breaking windows of a vehicle, yanking a woman out of the car and tasing a man. The two victims were later identified as college students at Spellman and Morehouse, both historically black schools, and were returning from protests calling for an end to police violence against black citizens.Arrest warrants have been issued for Lonnie Hood, Willie Sauls, Ivory Streeter, Mark Gardner, Armond Jones and Roland Claud. Some of the charges against the officers include aggravated assault of Messiah Young, aggravated assault of Taniyah Pilgrim, simple battery and criminal damage to property, Howard said.Two of the six officers, Streeter and Gardner, were terminated Sunday by Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms.CHARLESTON, W.Va. — The West Virginia National Guard is pursuing disciplinary action against a guardsman who posted on social media that he would shoot at people protesting the death of George Floyd, officials said Tuesday.The guardsman, Noah Garcelon, has already resigned his position as an officer with the Winfield Police Department after making the comments. In a series of now-deleted posts, Garcelon wrote that he would “start firing live rounds” at protesters and “see how many I can run over before my car breaks down.”Maj. Gen. James Hoyer, who leads the state’s National Guard, said officials will be taking the appropriate disciplinary action related to Garcelon and any others “who make inflammatory comments related to protests going on across the nation.”Winfield Police Department Chief Ron Arthur said Garcelon acknowledged that he made the comments and stressed that he wasn’t a racist before resigning.West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice, a Republican, has urged people to remain peaceful but said he would not hesitate to call in the National Guard if demonstrations in the state became violent.PHILADELPHIA — Joe Biden in a speech on Tuesday condemned President Donald Trump over the use of tear gas against peaceful protesters outside the White House in order to clear a park so that the president could visit a church for a photo opportunity.""The president held up the Bible at St. John's Church yesterday. I just wish he opened it every once in a while instead of just brandishing it,"" the former vice president and presumptive Democratic 2020 nominee said in Philadelphia.Characterizing the moment as a ""battle for the soul of our nation"" — an echo of Biden's central campaign theme — Biden condemned Trump's actions Monday night, which played out on live television as protesters who had been chanting with their hands in the air were suddenly scattered throughout Washington's streets.""When peaceful protestors are dispersed by the order of the president from the doorstep of the people's house, the White House — using tear gas and flash grenades — in order to stage a photo op, a photo op, at one of the most historic churches in the country or at least Washington, DC, we can be forgiven for believing that the president is more interested in power than in principle,"" Biden said.LAS VEGAS — An officer has been shot in Las Vegas and authorities are responding to another shooting as people protest the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, authorities said.The officer was shot in the area of the Las Vegas Strip and an officer was involved in a shooting in the downtown area, according to the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department.The department said both shootings were on Las Vegas Boulevard.Protesters have been rallying for days across the country over the death of Floyd, who was seen on video pleading that he couldn’t breathe with a white police officer pressing his knee into his neck for several minutes before Floyd stopped moving.Police in Las Vegas said Monday that 338 people were arrested during three nights of protests. Police said suspects were jailed despite a local court policy calling for most people accused of misdemeanors to receive court summons to prevent the spread of coronavirus.ST. LOUIS —Police say four officers were hit by gunfire after protests in St. Louis that started peacefully Monday became violent overnight, with demonstrators smashing windows and stealing items from businesses and fires burning in the downtown area.The police department tweeted early Tuesday that the officers were taken to a hospital with injuries that were not believed to be life-threatening. It was unclear who had fired the shots.The chaos in St. Louis followed continued protests Monday in Missouri over the death of George Floyd and police treatment of African Americans, with gatherings also held in Kansas City and Jefferson City.On Monday afternoon, several hundred people rallied peacefully outside the justice center in downtown St. Louis, including Mayor Lyda Krewson and St. Louis Public Safety Director Jimmie Edwards. Protestors later walked to the Gateway Arch National Park and then onto nearby Interstate 64.But later Monday, protesters gathered in front of police headquarters, where officers fired tear gas. Some protesters smashed windows at a downtown 7-11 store and stole items from inside before the building was set on fire. CICERO, Ill. — Authorities in a Chicago suburb where two people were fatally shot in unrest following George Floyd’s death are issuing fresh safety precautions Tuesday.Cicero officials cautioned residents to “stay home and stay off the streets” a day after violence and destruction erupted in the town of about 84,000 west of Chicago. Police say most of Monday’s chaos stemmed from residents trying to defend businesses. Roughly 60 people were arrested, mostly for burglary and weapons violations.Two men in their 20s were fatally shot around 6 p.m. in separate incidents related to the violent clashes.

Biden and President Donald Trump easily swept their respective primary contests that ranged from Maryland to Montana and featured the night’s biggest prize: Pennsylvania. The two men are certain to face each other on the presidential ballot in November, yet party rules require them first to accumulate a majority of delegates in the monthslong state-by-state primary season. Trump secured the Republican presidential nomination in March. Pennsylvania, which offered Tuesday’s largest trove of delegates, also represented a significant test case for Republicans and Democrats working to strengthen their operations in a premier general election battleground. Voters were forced to brave long lines in “militarized zones” because officials consolidated the vast majority of polling places in Philadelphia to minimize health risks, according to Erin Kramer, executive director of One Pennsylvania. She noted that some polling places in African American communities are in police stations. “Having to stand in line while police officers are entering and exiting the building on police business is not exactly how people want to spend their Election Day,” Kramer said. Biden was in Philadelphia earlier Tuesday to deliver remarks about the civil unrest that has erupted across the nation after the police killing of George Floyd. He didn’t talk about the primary, instead focusing his attention on Trump, whom Biden blasted as “more interested in power than in principle.” Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is not actively campaigning for the Democratic presidential nomination, having suspended his operation and endorsed Biden, but his name appeared on the ballots. On the eve of Tuesday’s primaries, senior adviser Jeff Weaver encouraged progressives to vote for Sanders anyway to help maximize his influence in the direction of the Democratic Party. The comments served as a reminder that Biden may have no legitimate Democratic rivals remaining but must still win over skeptical activists from his party’s far-left flank, who worry he’s too close to the political establishment. ADVERTISEMENTSkip ................................................................ Party unity was an afterthought this week, however, as more immediate health and safety concerns dominated the national conversation. The coronavirus death toll has surged past 100,000 nationwide, and thousands of new cases are reported each day. At the same time, several major cities, particularly Washington, D.C., and Philadelphia among those voting Tuesday, struggled to contain protests and related looting that led to thousands of arrests. Some voters said Trump’s increasingly tough tone toward protesters inspired them to participate in the democratic process. Nicholas Autiello, who works in finance in Rhode Island, said he was disturbed by police driving back peaceful demonstrators near the White House on Monday. “Last night, we have a president who is acting like a dictator,” Autiello said. “So being able to come out here this morning and fill in a circle next to a name for someone who I know will restore honor and decency to the presidency was so important.” Political groups have had to adjust as some states move to a system that relies largely on voting by mail. They include Montana, where all 56 counties decided to vote entirely by mail, despite Trump’s repeated warning against it. Voting rights watchdogs in multiple states on Tuesday expressed concerns about access to mail ballots, confusion about deadlines and a shortage of poll workers that led to long lines. “We are in unique times, and voting is a unique challenge for people,” said Josh Schwerin, chief strategist for the pro-Democrat super PAC Priorities USA. He said that his organization and others would be watching closely on Tuesday “to see how well it works, where issues are and where obstacles have been put in place.” Those voting Tuesday included the District of Columbia, Indiana, Maryland, Montana, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and South Dakota. Two other states holding primary elections on Tuesday, Idaho and Iowa, chose their presidential nominee early in the year. In Iowa, Republican Rep. Steve King, known nationally for controversial remarks, lost his bid to be nominated for a 10th term to state Sen. Randy Feenstra. House Republicans stripped King of his committee assignments in 2019 after comments that seemed to defend white nationalism, providing fuel for Feenstra’s argument that King was no longer an effective representative for the 4th District. In a New Mexico race for an open House seat, ex-CIA operative Valerie Plame lost the Democratic primary to attorney Teresa Leger Fernandez, a professional advocate for Native American communities and voting rights issues. A first-time candidate for public office, Plame harnessed her fame as the operative whose secret identity was exposed shorty after her diplomat husband disputed U.S. intelligence used to justify the 2003 Iraq invasion. ___ Associated Press writer Rodrique Ngowi in Providence, R.I., and Terry Spencer in West Palm Beach, Fla., contributed to this report. ___ Catch up on the 2020 election campaign with AP experts on our weekly politics podcast, “Ground Game.”",0.0

Prosecutors charge 3 more officers in George Floyd’s death MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Prosecutors charged three more police officers Wednesday in the death of George Floyd and filed a new, tougher charge against the officer at the center of the case, delivering a victory to protesters who have filled the streets from coast to coast to fight police brutality and racial injustice. The most serious charge was filed against Derek Chauvin, who was caught on video pressing his knee to Floyd’s neck and now must defend himself against an accusation of second-degree murder. The three other officers at the scene were charged for the first time with aiding and abetting second-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. All four were fired last week. If convicted, they could be sentenced to up to four decades in prison. Chauvin was initially charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Those charges still stand. The new second-degree murder charge alleges that Chauvin caused Floyd’s death without intent while committing another felony, namely third-degree assault. It carries a maximum penalty of 40 years in prison, compared with a maximum of 25 years for third-degree murder. ___ Ex-defense chief Mattis rips Trump for dividing Americans WASHINGTON (AP) — In an extraordinary rebuke, former defense secretary Jim Mattis on Wednesday denounced President Donald Trump’s heavy-handed use of military force to quell protests near the White House and said his former boss was setting up a “false conflict” between the military and civilian society. “I have watched this week’s unfolding events, angry and appalled,” Mattis wrote. The criticism was all the more remarkable because Mattis has generally kept a low profile since retiring as defense secretary in December 2018 to protest Trump’s Syria policy. He had declined to speak out against Trump, saying he owed the nation public silence while his former boss remained in office. But he’s speaking out after this past week’s protests in response to the death of George Floyd in police custody. Trump responded on Twitter Wednesday evening by calling Mattis “the world’s most overrated General.” ___ The Latest: Floyd tested positive for COVID-19 in April The Latest on the May 25 death in Minneapolis of George Floyd, a handcuffed black man who pleaded for air as a white police officer pressed a knee on his neck: TOP OF THE HOUR: — Autopsy shows George Floyd tested positive for COVID-19 in April. — Show of force from federal law enforcement agencies in Washington. — Police department in Charlotte under criticism. ___ Pentagon-Trump clash breaks open over military and protests WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump’s Pentagon chief shot down his idea of using troops to quell protests across the United States Wednesday, then reversed course on pulling part of the 82nd Airborne Division off standby in an extraordinary clash between the U.S. military and its commander in chief. Both Trump and Defense Secretary Mark Esper also drew stinging, rare public criticism from Trump’s first defense secretary, Jim Mattis, in the most public pushback of Trump’s presidency from the men he put at the helm of the world’s most powerful military. Mattis’ rebuke followed Trump’s threats to use the military to “dominate” the streets where Americans are demonstrating following the death of George Floyd, a black man who died when a white police officer pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes. The president had urged governors to call out the National Guard to contain protests that turned violent and warned that he could send in active duty military forces if they did not. Esper angered Trump early Wednesday when he said he opposed using military troops for law enforcement, seemingly taking the teeth out of the president’s threat to use the Insurrection Act. Esper said the 1807 law should be invoked in the United States “only in the most urgent and dire of situations.” He added, “We are not in one of those situations now.” After his subsequent visit to the White House, the Pentagon abruptly overturned an earlier decision to send a couple hundred active-duty soldiers home from the Washington, D.C., region, a public sign of the growing tensions with the White House amid mounting criticism that the Pentagon was being politicized in response to the protests. ___ Autopsy report shows Floyd had tested positive for COVID-19 MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — A full autopsy of George Floyd, the handcuffed black man who died after being restrained by Minneapolis police, was released Wednesday and provides several clinical details, including that Floyd had previously tested positive for COVID-19. The 20-page report released by the Hennepin County Medical Examiner’s Office came with the family’s permission and after the coroner’s office released summary findings Monday that Floyd had a heart attack while being restrained by officers, and classified his May 25 death as a homicide. Bystander video showing Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin pressing his knee on Floyd’s neck, ignoring Floyd’s “I can’t breathe” cries until he eventually stopped moving, has sparked nationwide protests, some violent. The report by Chief Medical Examiner Andrew Baker spelled out clinical details, including that Floyd had tested positive for COVID-19 on April 3 but appeared asymptomatic. The report also noted Floyd’s lungs appeared healthy but he had some narrowing of arteries in the heart. The county’s earlier summary report had listed fentanyl intoxication and recent methamphetamine use under “other significant conditions” but not under “cause of death.” The full report’s footnotes noted that signs of fentanyl toxicity can include “severe respiratory depression” and seizures. ___ Tiananmen anniversary marked by crackdown, HK vigil ban BEIJING (AP) — China tightened controls over dissidents while pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong and elsewhere sought ways to mark the 31st anniversary Thursday of the crushing of the pro-democracy movement centered on Beijing’s Tiananmen Square. That came after authorities in Hong Kong took the extraordinary move of canceling an annual candlelight vigil in the semi-autonomous Chinese territory for the first time in 30 years. Authorities cited the need for social distancing amid the coronavirus outbreak, despite the recent reopening of schools, beaches, bars and beauty parlors. Hong Kong has had relatively few cases of the virus and life has largely returned to normal in the city of 7.4 million. However, China has long detested the vigil, the only such activity allowed on Chinese territory to commemorate victims of the crackdown, which remains a taboo subject on the mainland. Hundreds, possibly thousands of people were killed when tanks and troops assaulted the center of Beijing to break up weeks of student-led protests seen as posing a threat to authoritarian Communist Party rule. The cancellation also comes amid a tightening of Beijing’s grip over Hong Kong, with the National People’s Congress, China’s ceremonial parliament, moving to pass national security legislation that circumvents Hong Kong’s local legislature and could severely limit free speech and opposition political activity. ___ AP FACT CHECK: Trump denies tear gas use despite evidence WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump and some of his supporters are claiming authorities did not use tear gas against people in a crackdown outside the White House this week. There’s evidence they did. Law enforcement officials shy away from describing crowd-dispersing chemical tools as tear gas; it evokes police gassing citizens or the horrors of war. But giving those tools a more antiseptic name does not change the reality on the ground. Federal institutions such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Chemical Defense have listed tear gas as the common term for riot-control agents. Whether the common or formal term is used, the effects on people are the same. Those effects were well documented when authorities forcefully cleared a crowd from outside the White House before Trump walked to St. John’s Church across Lafayette Park on Monday to be photographed holding a Bible. “They didn’t use tear gas,” Trump said Wednesday on Fox News Radio. The U.S. Park Police denied using tear gas, yet acknowledged deploying a pepper compound, which the CDC and other scientific organizations list as one form of tear gas. ___ Obama steps out as nation confronts confluence of crises WASHINGTON (AP) — Former President Barack Obama is taking on an increasingly public role as the nation confronts a confluence of historic crises that has exposed deep racial and socioeconomic inequalities in America and reshaped the November election. In doing so, Obama is signaling a willingness to sharply critique his successor, President Donald Trump, and fill what many Democrats see as a national leadership void. On Wednesday, he held a virtual town hall event with young people to discuss policing and the civil unrest that has followed the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Obama rejected a debate he said he’d seen come up in “a little bit of chatter on the internet” about “voting versus protests, politics and participation versus civil disobedience and direct action.” “This is not an either-or. This is a both and to bring about real change,” he said during the town hall hosted by his foundation’s My Brother’s Keeper Alliance, which supports young men of color. “We both have to highlight a problem and make people in power uncomfortable, but we also have to translate that into practical solutions and laws that could be implemented and monitored and make sure we’re following up on.” Obama called for turning the protests over Floyd’s death into policy change to ensure safer policing and increased trust between communities and law enforcement. He urged “every mayor in the country to review your use of force policies” with their communities and “commit to report on planned reforms” before prioritizing their implementation. ___ Tourist towns balance fear, survival in make-or-break summer CANNON BEACH, Ore. (AP) — As the coronavirus raced across America, this quaint seaside town did what would normally be unthinkable for a tourist destination. Spooked by a deluge of visitors, the tiny Oregon community shooed people from its expansive beaches and shut down hundreds of hotels and vacation rentals overnight. Signs went up announcing that the vacation getaway 80 miles (129 kilometers) from Portland known for towering coastal rock formations was closed to tourists — no exceptions. “It was unprecedented,” said Patrick Nofield, whose hospitality company Escape Lodging owns four hotels in Cannon Beach and abruptly laid off more than 400 employees in March. “We really went into survival mode.” Now, with summer looming and coronavirus restrictions lifting, the choices facing Cannon Beach are emblematic of those confronting thousands of other small, tourist-dependent towns nationwide that are struggling to balance their residents’ fears of contagion with economic survival. It’s a make-or-break summer in these vacation spots — and the future is still terrifyingly unclear. “How do you regulate people inundating your town on a day-to-day basis?” Nofield said. “One of the great things about Oregon is our beaches are free to all. We don’t want to take away people’s rights, but how do we manage it and still stay safe? That’s the thing.” ___ Brees’ anthem comments draw backlash from teammates, others NEW ORLEANS (AP) — Drew Brees was sharply criticized by fellow high-profile athletes, including some of his own teammates, on Wednesday after the Saints quarterback reiterated his opposition to kneeling during the national anthem. In an interview with Yahoo, Brees was asked to revisit former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick’s 2016 protest of police brutality against minorities, in which Kaepernick knelt during the national anthem before games. “I will never agree with anybody disrespecting the flag of the United States,” Brees began, adding that the national anthem reminds him of his grandfathers, who served in the armed forces during World War II. “In many cases, it brings me to tears thinking about all that has been sacrificed, and not just in the military, but for that matter, those throughout the civil rights movements of the ’60s, and all that has been endured by so many people up until this point.” Critical responses to Brees’ statements appeared on social media from a couple major professional athletes, including the Los Angeles Lakers’ LeBron James and Saints safety Malcolm Jenkins. Jenkins was Brees’ teammate when the Saints won the Super Bowl in the 2009 season, but spent the past six seasons with the Philadelphia Eagles before returning to New Orleans this offseason.",0.0

MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — The two men stepped from the shadows as the car turned off an upscale shopping street into a residential area located on the far edge of the rioting that swept through Minneapolis. It was after midnight. A pair of metal dividers blocked the road, and the men stepped to either side of the car as it stopped. Both carried assault rifles. “Do you live here?” one of the men asked, politely, but forcefully. His hands rested casually on the rifle slung across his chest, and a pistol was strapped to his belt. “We have lots of old people here,” he continued, satisfied that the driver, an AP reporter, posed no danger. “We don’t want anyone to get hurt.” A week of civil unrest has led some Minneapolis residents near the epicenter of the violence to take steps to protect their homes and neighborhoods. They’ve stocked up on fire extinguishers and buckets, and formed scores of loose neighborhood watch groups — aided by a cluster of apps and social media — to share what they view as suspicious activity. Preparing for nightfall in Minneapolis has meant a new routine for many: stashing garbage cans to keep them from being tossed or set on fire, turning on lights and opening blinds. In some neighborhoods near large demonstrations, witnesses say it also includes residents armed with baseball bats, crowbars and the occasional pistol barricading their streets to keep violent protesters away. Similar scenes have started to emerge across the country as the angry protests have spread, along with a heightened sense of fear and diminished confidence that police will keep the peace. In Chicago’s heavily-Mexican Little Village enclave, neighborhood residents stood watch as shops were vandalized along a busy commercial strip. For some, it’s all a sign of community pride and rational response when policing has broken down, as it did in most destructive nights in Minneapolis last week. But others see a more troubling undercurrent in the anxiety and mobilization, particularly as it spreads to largely white neighborhoods that have seen little or no damage. “There’s a sense of state failure and into state failure comes private actions to protect one’s family and one’s community,” said Omar Wasow, an assistant professor of politics at Princeton University who writes about race and the politics of protest movements. “You take that and you layer it on the long, deep-rooted racist mythology that says, ‘I should be scared and black people are a threat,’ and you get a kind of circle-the-wagons behavior.”’ Peter Baggenstos has felt the tension in his neighborhood, a largely white, wealthy pocket of Minneapolis about a mile from a stretch of stores that were vandalized. Baggenstos, a doctor who is African American, said he senses a lot of “passive policing” at night, as neighbors keep lights on and trade text messages about cars or people on the street after curfew. “You’ve got that feeling that eyes are on you,” he said. As a result, his wife alerted the neighbors when Baggenstos came home late recently, driving his Tesla. It does not have a front license plate, something likely to raise suspicions these days. “People want to take control over what they feel they’re losing control of — in this case, it’s their personal well-being and that of their family members,” Baggenstos said. “But it’s gotten to this level where it’s dangerous. It’s causing everyone to be paranoid.” He said he’s particularly worried about the surge of rumors and claims on text chains and apps, technology that has transformed old notions of a neighborhood watch. Since protests first erupted in Minneapolis last week in response to the death of George Floyd, a handcuffed black man who died after a white police officer pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck for several minutes as he pleaded for air and eventually stopped moving, neighbors across south Minneapolis have rushed for updates on apps like Next Door, GroupMe and Citizen. By Tuesday, one GroupMe neighborhood watch group had swelled to 479 members, organized into seven smaller regions. Members, identified only by their first names and cross streets, posted a steady stream of descriptions of suspicious vehicles, loud popping sounds, worries about outsiders and objects that might be filled with accelerants used to set fires. “I would guess those are lawn bags,” one poster said. Residents have reason to be on alert. Arson and vandalism have devastated a large stretch of a vital corridor in south Minneapolis, and have spread beyond to pockets of neighboring St. Paul and some suburbs. State law enforcement authorities have said they’ve found caches of flammable liquids all over the metropolitan area, as well as stolen vehicles without license plates that they believe have been used to move the material. In the worst-hit neighborhoods, where store after store was sometimes burned to the ground and looting was brazen, groups of neighbors sometimes set up makeshift barricades at their street corners, standing behind them for hours with baseball bats and metal rods. But most of the tactics are far less confrontational. Michael Grunke, a 35-year-old who lives near where Floyd died, said he and other tenants in his building gathered hoses and buckets for water. The building manager bought up fire extinguishers before they sold out at some local hardware stores. The group stayed up all night, standing watch, he said — his way to show support for the peaceful protests. “This was a good thing I could do to help the community and make sure things weren’t getting destroyed and tarnishing the memory of George Floyd,” Grunke said. Joy Miciano, 47, lives with her husband and their two teenage children in the South Uptown area, where stores have been damaged but few buildings burned. She said she and her husband stayed up keeping watch Friday because they felt no police or firefighters would respond. “That’s what was worrisome to us — if this was coming our way, there was no one to call for help,” she said. __ Associated Press writers Sophia Tareen contributed from Chicago and Jeff Baenen contributed from Minneapolis.",0.0

NEW YORK (AP) — New York City police officers surrounded, shoved and yelled expletives at two Associated Press journalists covering protests Tuesday in the latest aggression against members of the media during a week of unrest around the country. Portions of the incident were captured on video by videojournalist Robert Bumsted, who was working with photographer Maye-E Wong to document the protests in lower Manhattan over the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. The video shows more than a half-dozen officers confronting the journalists as they filmed and took photographs of police ordering protesters to leave the area near Fulton and Broadway shortly after an 8 p.m. curfew took effect. An officer, using an expletive, orders them to go home. Bumsted is heard on video explaining the press are considered “essential workers” and are allowed to be on the streets. An officer responds “I don’t give a s—-.” Another tells Bumsted “get the f—- out of here you piece of s—-.” Bumsted and Wong said officers shoved them, separating them from each other and pushing them toward Bumsted’s car, which was parked nearby. At one point Bumsted said he was pinned against his car. He is heard on video telling the officer that Wong has his keys and he needs them to leave the area. Officers then allowed Wong to approach and the two got in the vehicle and left. Both journalists were wearing AP identification and identified themselves as media. “They didn’t care,” Wong said. “They were just shoving me.” NYPD officials said they would “review this as soon as possible.” Journalists have faced aggressive police and protesters during demonstrations across the U.S. over the killing of Floyd, a handcuffed black man who died after a white officer pressed his knee on Floyd’s neck. Police in Louisville, Kentucky, apologized after an officer fired what appeared to be pepper bullets at a TV news crew, and a journalist in Minneapolis was shot by a rubber bullet. Journalists have faced other risks while covering the unrest, in addition to dealing with aggression from police. In South Carolina, a television news reporter was hit in the head by a thrown rock and outside the White House, a Fox News reporter was chased and pummeled by protesters. Someone grabbed the reporter’s microphone and threw it at his back, and a Fox News photographer’s camera was smashed. In Atlanta, demonstrators who fought with police and set cars on fire also broke windows and scrawled obscene graffiti at CNN headquarters. AP spokeswoman Lauren Easton criticized the officers’ actions Tuesday, which occurred as thousands of people in New York were defying a curfew put in place following several nights of violence and destruction. Journalists covering the story are exempt from the curfew. “The role of journalists is to report the news on behalf of the public,” Easton said. “It is unacceptable and deeply troubling when journalists are harassed simply for doing their job.”",0.0

Most Asian stock markets were mixed Thursday after Wall Street gain on surveys showing better U.S. jobs and manufacturing conditions than expected. Benchmarks in Shanghai and Hong Kong declined while Tokyo, Sydney and Southeast Asia advanced. Stock markets have risen on optimism about a possible global recovery from the coronavirus pandemic as more economies reopen despite rising case numbers in the United States, Brazil and other countries. Wall Street turned in its fourth straight gain after surveys Wednesday showed employers cut fewer jobs than forecast last month and a U.S. manufacturing downturn eased slightly. “The not too bad news keeps coming, enabling the hopes for economic rebound alongside the reopening,” said Jingyi Pan of IG in a report. The Nikkei 225 in Tokyo was up just under 0.1% at 22,631.01 and Sydney’s S&P-ASX 200 advanced 0.6% to 5,976.70. New Zealand and Jakarta also advanced. The Shanghai Composite Index lost 0.2% to 2,917.56 and the Hang Seng in Hong Kong shed 0.2% to 24,282.19 amid U.S.-Chinese tension over trade and efforts by Beijing to tighten control over Hong Kong. The Kospi in Seoul declined 0.2% to 2,142.53. On Wednesday, the Trump administration said it would suspend passenger flights by four Chinese airlines to and from the United States starting June 16 because Beijing has failed to approve a resumption of flights to China by United and Delta Airlines. On Wall Street, the S&P 500 rose 1.4% on Wednesday to 3,122.87. The index has gained nearly 40% since late March. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 2% to 26,269.89. The Nasdaq composite rose 0.8% to 9.682.91. A survey from payroll processor ADP said that private employers cut nearly 2.8 million jobs last month, but that was much milder than the 9.3 million that economists told investors to expect. That raises optimism that Friday’s more comprehensive jobs report from the U.S. government may also not be as bad as feared. Economists say it may show a loss of 8 million jobs, which would be a deceleration from April’s loss of 20.5 million jobs. Other reports showed the U.S. economy is in bad shape but not as dismal as forecast. One report said services industries contracted by less than economists expected, and at a more modest rate than in April. Another report said factory orders dropped 13% in April, but not by as much as the 14.8% that economists had forecast. Companies that would most benefit from a growing economy led the market Wednesday, continuing a recent trend as hopes rise that the economy and life in general can become closer to normal as business-shutdown orders lift. Stocks have been climbing since late March, at first on relief after the Federal Reserve and Congress promised massive amounts of aid for the economy. More recently, the driving force has been optimism that growth can resume as states across the country and nations around the world lift restrictions on businesses intended to slow the spread of the outbreak. Widespread protests around the country following the killing of George Floyd haven’t dented the rally. One worry is that by bringing so many people together, the protests could also lead to more coronavirus infections. Many professional investors have been warning that the stock market’s rally may have been too much, too soon. The recovery for the economy is likely to be much slower than the sharp rebound the stock market has just undertaken, which could be setting investors up for disappointment. In energy markets, benchmark U.S. crude lost 68 cents to $36.61 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude, the benchmark for international oils, shed 44 cents to $39.35 per barrel in London. The dollar declined to 108.87 yen from Wednesday’s 108.90 yen.

NEW YORK (AP) — Peaceful protests over the death of George Floyd continued Wednesday in New York City, but an early curfew, drenching rain and refined police tactics appeared to have stopped some of the destruction of previous nights. Some critics said the calm came at a high price, as the city was forced to grind to a halt at 8 p.m., bridges were closed to traffic and police arrested dozens of orderly people for violating the curfew. About an hour after the deadline to get off the street, officers began moving in on crowds of demonstrators in Manhattan and Brooklyn, at times blasting people with pepper spray or using batons to shove people who didn’t move fast enough. When one demonstrator asked an officer why he was being taken into custody, an Associated Press reporter heard the officer reply, “Curfew violater. You didn’t hear the news?” NYPD Chief of Department Terence Monahan said about 60 people were arrested near Central Park out of a large band of protesters who had marched from near the mayor’s residence, Gracie Mansion. Police moved in just before a heavy rain began. “When we have these big crowds, especially in this area, especially where we’ve had the looting, no more tolerance. They have to be off the street. An 8 o’clock curfew, we gave them until 9 o’clock, and there was no indication that they were going to leave these streets,” Monahan said, noting that the crowd was allowed to disperse once arrests began, and most did. City Public Advocate Jumaane Williams, who attended a rally in downtown Brooklyn, expressed outrage that peaceful demonstrations were broken up. “I can’t believe what I just witnessed & experienced,” Williams wrote on twitter. He called the use of force on nonviolent protesters “disgusting.” As the evening deepened, there were few reports of the mayhem that had occurred on several days of demonstrations, when protesters burned police vehicles and showered officers with debris. Gone also were the roving bands of people who smashed their way into scores of stores and stole merchandise Sunday and Monday nights. Protesters also appeared to react more calmly to police attempts to break up crowds, a contrast to the early days of the protests where attempts to break up crowds were sometimes met with thrown objects. At Gracie Mansion, demonstrators were kneeling in a moment of silence when alarms rang on cellphones, warning that the curfew was approaching. “This means a lot to me, as a black woman,” said protester Stella Mbah, who kept marching after the curfew passed. “There are so many things police are doing wrong to us black people.” Another demonstrator, Lisa Horton, said charges announced Wednesday against three other Minneapolis police officers in connection to Floyd’s death were a step, but she was protesting because she feels more needs to change. “There’s been progress, but are we at a point where we can all celebrate? No,” she said, calling for “radical change” in the criminal justice system. Tuesday night’s protests had also been mostly peaceful, prompting Mayor Bill de Blasio to declare that an early curfew was working. “Last night we took a step forward in moving out of this difficult period we’ve had the last few days and moving to a better time,” he said at a morning news briefing. Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who was critical of the police response on prior nights, said the city Tuesday “was much, much better than the night before.” “It worked. We got results,” Cuomo said. “Let’s just remember what we did last night and keep that going.” De Blasio rejected President Donald Trump’s urging and Cuomo’s offer to send in the National Guard to stop the ransacking of stores, saying the NYPD was best suited for the task. Trump warned in a Fox News Radio interview that if city officials “don’t get their act straightened out, I will solve it. I’ll solve it fast,” but didn’t say what action he might take. Around Manhattan, even in parts of the city that hadn’t seen the damage and thefts, businesses had boarded up windows Wednesday as a precaution. That was the case at Saks Fifth Avenue, where a line of tattooed men with well-mannered dogs guarded the boarded windows wrapped in chain-link and razor wire. The nightly curfews will remain in effect through at least Sunday, with the city planning to lift it at the same time it enters the first phase of reopening after more than two months of shutdowns because of the coronavirus. The marches were part of a wave of protests across the country since the May 25 death of Floyd, a black man who died after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed a knee on his neck and left it there even after he lost consciousness. Police said they arrested about 280 people on Tuesday, compared with 700 the previous night. In all, more than 2,000 people have been arrested, the NYPD said. Wednesday, prosecutors also charged a man with shooting at an occupied police vehicle in Queens. Neither officer in the vehicle was wounded. No demonstration was underway in the area and the man’s motive in shooting at the vehicle was unclear. De Blasio condemned police for roughing up journalists covering the protests, including two from the AP who were shoved, cursed at and told to go home by officers Tuesday night despite press being considered “essential workers” allowed to be on the streets. “There should be no condition under which any journalist is detained by the police of this city or any city in the United States of America, period,” de Blasio said, calling for an investigation. Shea said officers were “doing the best we can under difficult circumstances,” adding that some people stopped by police lied about being journalists. “We’re not perfect, we do the best we can in a situation,” he said. ___ Jennifer Peltz and Jim Mustian in New York City and Marina Villeneuve in Albany contributed to this report. ___ On Twitter: Follow Michael Sisak at twitter.com/mikesisak and Jake Seiner at twitter.com/Jake_Seiner",0.0

LE PECQ, France (AP) — Three days after George Floyd died with a Minneapolis police officer choking off his air, another black man writhed on the tarmac of a street in Paris as a police officer pressed a knee to his neck during an arrest. Immobilization techniques where officers apply pressure with their knees on prone suspects are used in policing around the world and have long drawn criticism. One reason why Floyd’s death is sparking anger and touching nerves globally is that such techniques have been blamed for asphyxiations and other deaths in police custody beyond American shores, often involving non-white suspects. “We cannot say that the American situation is foreign to us,” said French lawmaker Francois Ruffin, who has pushed for a ban on the police use of face-down holds that are implicated in multiple deaths in France, a parliamentary effort put on hold by the coronavirus pandemic. The muscular arrest on May 28 in Paris of a black man who was momentarily immobilized face-up with an officer’s knee and upper shin pressing down on his jaw, neck and upper chest is among those that have drawn angry comparisons with the killing of Floyd on May 25 in Minneapolis. The Paris arrest was filmed by bystanders and widely shared and viewed online. Police said the man was driving under the influence of drugs and alcohol and without a license and that he resisted arrest and insulted officers. His case was turned over to prosecutors. In Hong Kong, where police behavior is a hot-button issue after months of anti-government protests, the city’s force says it is investigating the death of a man who was immobilized face-down during his arrest in May by officers who were filmed kneeling on his shoulder, back and neck. Police rules and procedures on chokeholds and restraints vary internationally. In Belgium, police instructor Stany Durieux says he reprimands trainees, docking them points, “every time I see a knee applied to the spinal column.” “It is also forbidden to lean on a suspect completely, as this can crush his rib cage and suffocate him,” he said. Condemned by police and experts in the United States, Floyd’s death also drew criticism from officers abroad who disassociated themselves from the behavior of Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin. He was charged with third-degree murder after he was filmed pushing down with his knee on Floyd’s neck until Floyd stopped crying out that he couldn’t breathe and eventually stopped moving. In Israel, police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said “there is no tactic or protocol that calls to put pressure on the neck or airway.” In Germany, officers are allowed to briefly exert pressure on the side of a suspect’s head but not on the neck, says Germany‘s GdP police union. In the U.K., the College of Policing says prone suspects should be placed on their side or in a sitting, kneeling or standing position “as soon as practicable.” Guidance on the website of London’s police force discourages the use of neck restraints, saying “any form of pressure to the neck area can be highly dangerous.” Even within countries, procedures can vary. The thick Patrol Guide, hundreds of pages long, for the New York Police Department says in bold capitals that officers “SHALL NOT” use chokeholds and should “avoid actions which may result in chest compression, such as sitting, kneeling, or standing on a subject’s chest or back, thereby reducing the subject’s ability to breathe.” But the so-called “sleeper hold,” where pressure is applied to the neck with an arm, blocking blood flow, was allowed for police in San Diego before Floyd’s death triggered a shift. Police Chief David Nisleit said he would this week order an end to the tactic. Gendarmes in France are discouraged from pressing down on the chests and vital organs of prone suspects and are no longer taught to apply pressure to the neck, said Col. Laurent De La Follye de Joux, head of training for the force. “You don’t need to be a doctor to understand that it is dangerous,” he said. But instructions for the National Police, the other main law and order force in France, appear to give its officers more leeway. Issued in 2015, they say pressure on a prone suspect’s chest “should be as short as possible.” Christophe Rouget, a police union official who briefed lawmakers for their deliberations in March about the proposal to ban suffocating techniques, said if officers don’t draw pistols or use stun-guns then immobilizing people face-down is the safest option, stopping suspects from kicking out at arresting officers. “We don’t have 5,000 options,” he said. “These techniques are used by all the police in the world because they represent the least amount of danger. The only thing is that they have to be well used. In the United States, we saw that it wasn’t well used, with pressure applied in the wrong place and for too long.” He added that the “real problem” in France is that officers don’t get enough follow-up training after being taught restraints in police school. “You need to repeat them often to do them well,” he said. ___ AP journalists Samuel Petrequin in Brussels, Michael Sisak in New York, Zen Soo in Hong Kong, Aron Heller in Tel Aviv, Israel, and Geir Moulson in Berlin contributed. ___",0.0

Similar demonstrations have played out from New York City to Los Angeles, with many turning violent as authorities use everything from tear gas and curfews to the National Guard to quell the crowds. Videos of widespread looting and police brutality against crowds have become a mainstay of social media. However, the protests in Albuquerque have remained largely peaceful. And Tuesday was no different as more than 300 demonstrators walked down Central Avenue through a driving rain, chanting George Floyd’s name and waving signs condemning police brutality, before stopping at the steps of the Albuquerque police headquarters. “There is a rebellion sweeping the entire country, and we are a part of that, and you should be proud of that,” Satya Vatti, with the Party for Socialism and Liberation, yelled through a megaphone atop the steps. “What’s happening in Albuquerque is not isolated. This is part of a larger movement – against police brutality; it’s a larger movement against this entire (expletive) racist system.” Afterward, the group headed back toward the University of New Mexico past the boarded-up windows, graffiti and charred dumpsters from a destructive Sunday night. A man, who did not want to be identified, said he had a message for those in leadership roles near and far: “We don’t need you for our change. “Our leader of the nation is a coward, who cowers in a bunker; we cannot have that at local levels,” he said. “They must stand and they must lead, or they will be replaced.” The man said the Albuquerque Police Department also has a part to play in stopping what is happening in its own backyard. “APD is a policing unit,” he said. “They must police out racism. If they see something, they say something.” He said the destruction Sunday night was not part of the protests but undertaken by “outside agitators.” “Rage will always be a part of our movement, but we will temper rage with our love,” the man said.",0.0

MINNEAPOLIS — Prosecutors charged three more police officers Wednesday in the death of George Floyd and filed a new, tougher charge against the officer at the center of the case, delivering a victory to protesters who have filled the streets from coast to coast to fight police brutality and racial injustice. The most serious charge was filed against Derek Chauvin, who was caught on video pressing his knee to Floyd’s neck and now must defend himself against an accusation of second-degree murder. The three other officers at the scene were charged for the first time with aiding and abetting second-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. All four were fired last week. If convicted, they could be sentenced to up to four decades in prison. ADVERTISEMENTSkip ................................................................ Chauvin was initially charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Those charges still stand. The new second-degree murder charge alleges that Chauvin caused Floyd’s death without intent while committing another felony, namely third-degree assault. It carries a maximum penalty of 40 years in prison, compared with a maximum of 25 years for third-degree murder. The other officers — Thomas Lane, J. Kueng and Tou Thao — face the same maximum penalties for aiding and abetting. All three men were in custody by Wednesday evening. Chauvin was arrested last week and is still being held. The multiple charges against each officer would offer a jury more options to find them guilty. The charges were sought by Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, who called the protests unleashed by the death “dramatic and necessary” and said Floyd “should be here and he is not.” “His life had value, and we will seek justice,” said Ellison, who cautioned that winning convictions would be hard and said that public pressure had no bearing on his decisions. Hundreds of protesters were in New York City’s Washington Square Park when the charges were announced. “It’s not enough,” protester Jonathan Roldan said, insisting all four officers should have been charged from the start. “Right now, we’re still marching because it’s not enough that they got arrested. There needs to be systematic change.” ADVERTISEMENTSkip ................................................................ Ben Crump, an attorney for Floyd’s family, called it “a bittersweet moment” and “a significant step forward on the road to justice.” Crump said Elison had told the family he would continue his investigation into Floyd’s death and upgrade the charge to first-degree murder if warranted. The move by prosecutors punctuated an unprecedented week in modern American history, in which largely peaceful protests took place in communities of all sizes but were rocked by bouts of violence, including deadly attacks on officers, rampant thefts and arson in some places. Nationwide, more than 9,000 have been arrested in connection with unrest. At least 12 deaths have been reported, though the circumstances in many cases are still being sorted out. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, speaking after the new charges were announced, said the state and nation need to “seize the moment” and use the wrenching events of the past week to confront the effects of racism, including unequal educational and economic opportunities. “I think this is probably our last shot, as a state and as a nation, to fix this systemic issue,” he said at a news conference. Also Wednesday, the Hennepin County Medical Examiner’s Office released the full autopsy report on Floyd, which noted he had previously tested positive for COVID-19, but was apparently asymptomatic. The report was released with the family’s permission after summary findings Monday that said he had a heart attack while being restrained by officers. President Donald Trump has pushed the nation’s governors to take a hard line against the violence. He again tweeted Wednesday: “LAW & ORDER!” An overpowering security force — including officers from the FBI Hostage Rescue Team, the Secret Service, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Bureau of Prisons and, according to a senior defense official, at least 2,200 National Guard soldiers — was out in force Wednesday as thousands of peaceful protesters demonstrated in the nation’s capital. Some remained near the White House while others marched toward the Capitol building. ADVERTISEMENTSkip ................................................................ Military vehicles were parked on streets near the White House, and an array of agencies kept watch from the air. An FBI plane, an Army surveillance plane and a Park Police helicopter circled overhead. At one point near the White House, protesters began singing “Amazing Grace” as they knelt in view of law enforcement officers in riot gear. “We are not going anywhere!” they chanted. There were no signs of confrontations. Protester Jade Jones, 30, said the demonstrations would continue despite the new charges. “That’s the least they could do,” said Jones, who had been attending Washington protests for days. “It’s not going to wipe away 400 years of pain.” “We are glad there are additional charges, but that doesn’t mean justice has been served,” she said. More than 20,000 National Guard members have been called up in 29 states to deal with the violence. In New York City, where high-end stores were looted in earlier days, some retailers fortified their property. At the luxury department store Saks Fifth Avenue, windows were boarded up, then covered in chain-link fencing and razor wire. The front of the store was guarded by a line of tattooed men with dogs. There was scuffling in some parts of the city Wednesday night, but no signs of major clashes between protesters and police. The protests have also taken root overseas. ADVERTISEMENTSkip ................................................................ In Greece, police fired tear gas after young people attacked them Wednesday outside the U.S. Embassy in Athens. Some 4,000 protesters had been peaceful until near the end of the demonstration, when some threw gasoline bombs and stones at police. No injuries or arrests were reported. Other protests were held Wednesday in London, Helsinki, Rotterdam and Bogota, among other cities. The anger over Floyd’s death has spilled into an array of racial issues across the U.S. In Philadelphia, for example, a statue of former Mayor Frank Rizzo was removed by the city Wednesday after repeatedly being targeted by vandals. Rizzo presided over a police force widely accused of racism and brutality in the 1970s. In Virginia, Gov. Ralph Northam was expected to announce plans Thursday for the removal of an iconic statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee from Richmond’s prominent Monument Avenue, a senior administration official told The Associated Press. The statue in the former Confederate capital has been the target of vandalism during the protests. ___ Associated Press journalists across the U.S. contributed to this report.",0.0
1624130414,2020-06-03 05:00:00,Ex-Department Of Justice Leader Who Appointed Mueller To Testify In Senate,https://www.krwg.org/post/ex-department-justice-leader-who-appointed-mueller-testify-senate,en,False,,214420,krwg.org,http://krwg.org/,"Updated at 4:09 p.m. ET Former Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said Wednesday that if he knew then what he knows now, he would not have signed his now-infamous application to continue surveillance on an ex-junior aide to Donald Trump. Rosenstein told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he relied on lower-level investigators and attorneys to do the right thing in preparing applications for the secret court that authorizes surveillance on Americans. Now, he said, he recognizes via the subsequent investigations that those officials did not do the right thing — and accordingly, Rosenstein said he wouldn't have signed the application. The former deputy attorney general defended the overall need for an investigation into the Russian interference in the 2016 election and said he stood by its findings and much of its work. But he also acknowledged that it has since become clear he and other Justice Department leaders were acting upon incomplete information. In the case of former Trump aide Carter Page, Rosenstein said he remembered an application for renewal, one that that had been submitted before, and one that he then believed made a cogent case to continue the surveillance. ""My recollection of it was that it was actually fairly persuasive,"" he said. GOP vows more investigation of Russia investigation Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., went ahead with a session Wednesday scheduled before the flare in protests and violence that followed the death of a Minneapolis man, George Floyd, at the hands of police in an incident that reignited long-simmering anger at police in cities across the country. The political context has evolved; Republicans want to tie former Vice President Joe Biden into what they call the abuses of power from the end of the Obama era. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said what he called the ""Obama-Biden administration"" had done ""went right up to the very top"" and was worse than the abuses of President Richard Nixon. Cruz also called Rosenstein ""grossly negligent."" He and Republicans sought answers about what Rosenstein and other Justice Department leaders knew at the time they were making fateful decisions about the FBI's investigation into the Russian interference in the 2016 election, which sought to hinder Hillary Clinton and help elect then-candidate Donald Trump. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., rejected Cruz's comparison between Obama and Nixon and said it would ""never stand the test of time."" She also said Graham was wasting everyone's time now. ""I have made it very clear that I think that it is absurd we are having this hearing."" Strange days Rosenstein found himself in the center of a political vortex in the spring of 2017, not long after he'd been nominated by Trump and confirmed by the Republican-controlled Senate. His boss, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, was a Trump loyalist and had recused himself from the Russian matter. The president had fired FBI Director James Comey. In the midst of that febrile atmosphere, Rosenstein appointed former FBI Director Robert Mueller to serve as a special counsel and continue the Russia investigation. ""I was concerned the public would not have confidence in the investigation and that the acting FBI director [at the time] was not the right person to lead it,"" Rosenstein told senators on Wednesday. ""I decided appointment of special counsel was the best way to complete the investigation and promote public confidence in the conclusions."" Re-look after re-look has verified Mueller's findings about the Russian interference, but the work of the FBI and Justice Department wasn't found to be problem-free. Issues with the FBI investigators involved and their dealings within officialdom, especially with the secret court that oversees government surveillance, have embarrassed the top levels of federal law enforcement. Longtime target Many Republicans have faulted Rosenstein since his earliest days over his appointment of Mueller. Now, Graham brought Rosenstein back into center stage at a time when Trump and other allies want to link Biden with intelligence collection that involved members of the Trump camp. Graham said he also intends to conduct more interviews and hearings about the investigation, including with planned subpoenas. One future witness could include the former deputy director of the FBI, Andrew McCabe, Graham said. ""We're going to get to the bottom of it ... this stinks,"" Graham said. ""This is a sad episode on the history of the FBI."" Biden's camp has rejected the idea there were any abuses and pointed out that there was no way for administration officials to single out Americans in intelligence reporting because their names were hidden, or masked. They were only identified after requests for more information about who was talking with existing targets, Biden's campaign said. That practice is legal and takes place thousands of times per year. Trump and allies have made it the basis of political attacks against Biden and others from that era, as Cruz repeated at Wednesday's hearing. Biden, in turn, has blasted Trump and Republicans for what he calls their attempt to distract attention from the most pressing challenges of the day — first the coronavirus pandemic and now the national unrest over police violence. ""Sen. Graham sold his conscience in exchange for a better shot at winning his primary,"" a spokesman for Biden's campaign said Democrats, who are in the minority on the Senate Judiciary Committee, took up that theme on Wednesday, led by Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California. She also restated that the findings and much of the work of the Mueller era have been validated. Feinstein emphasized with Rosenstein that the infamous, never-verified Russia dossier was not used as the basis to charge anyone. And Rosenstein underlined what he called the important need to conduct investigations that might not necessarily lead to charges — and that in the case of the Mueller era, no Americans ultimately were charged with conspiring with the Russians who attacked the election. Republicans argue the mere fact of a continued investigation into Page — after evidence surfaced they argue should have quashed it — is improper even though Page was never charged.

1624148649,2020-06-03 05:00:00,Ex-Department Of Justice Leader Who Appointed Mueller To Testify In Senate,https://www.kunm.org/post/ex-department-justice-leader-who-appointed-mueller-testify-senate,en,False,,146446,kunm.org,http://kunm.org/,"Updated at 4:09 p.m. ET Former Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said Wednesday that if he knew then what he knows now, he would not have signed his now-infamous application to continue surveillance on an ex-junior aide to Donald Trump. Rosenstein told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he relied on lower-level investigators and attorneys to do the right thing in preparing applications for the secret court that authorizes surveillance on Americans. Now, he said, he recognizes via the subsequent investigations that those officials did not do the right thing — and accordingly, Rosenstein said he wouldn't have signed the application. The former deputy attorney general defended the overall need for an investigation into the Russian interference in the 2016 election and said he stood by its findings and much of its work. But he also acknowledged that it has since become clear he and other Justice Department leaders were acting upon incomplete information. In the case of former Trump aide Carter Page, Rosenstein said he remembered an application for renewal, one that that had been submitted before, and one that he then believed made a cogent case to continue the surveillance. ""My recollection of it was that it was actually fairly persuasive,"" he said. GOP vows more investigation of Russia investigation Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., went ahead with a session Wednesday scheduled before the flare in protests and violence that followed the death of a Minneapolis man, George Floyd, at the hands of police in an incident that reignited long-simmering anger at police in cities across the country. The political context has evolved; Republicans want to tie former Vice President Joe Biden into what they call the abuses of power from the end of the Obama era. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said what he called the ""Obama-Biden administration"" had done ""went right up to the very top"" and was worse than the abuses of President Richard Nixon. Cruz also called Rosenstein ""grossly negligent."" He and Republicans sought answers about what Rosenstein and other Justice Department leaders knew at the time they were making fateful decisions about the FBI's investigation into the Russian interference in the 2016 election, which sought to hinder Hillary Clinton and help elect then-candidate Donald Trump. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., rejected Cruz's comparison between Obama and Nixon and said it would ""never stand the test of time."" She also said Graham was wasting everyone's time now. ""I have made it very clear that I think that it is absurd we are having this hearing."" Strange days Rosenstein found himself in the center of a political vortex in the spring of 2017, not long after he'd been nominated by Trump and confirmed by the Republican-controlled Senate. His boss, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, was a Trump loyalist and had recused himself from the Russian matter. The president had fired FBI Director James Comey. In the midst of that febrile atmosphere, Rosenstein appointed former FBI Director Robert Mueller to serve as a special counsel and continue the Russia investigation. ""I was concerned the public would not have confidence in the investigation and that the acting FBI director [at the time] was not the right person to lead it,"" Rosenstein told senators on Wednesday. ""I decided appointment of special counsel was the best way to complete the investigation and promote public confidence in the conclusions."" Re-look after re-look has verified Mueller's findings about the Russian interference, but the work of the FBI and Justice Department wasn't found to be problem-free. Issues with the FBI investigators involved and their dealings within officialdom, especially with the secret court that oversees government surveillance, have embarrassed the top levels of federal law enforcement. Longtime target Many Republicans have faulted Rosenstein since his earliest days over his appointment of Mueller. Now, Graham brought Rosenstein back into center stage at a time when Trump and other allies want to link Biden with intelligence collection that involved members of the Trump camp. Graham said he also intends to conduct more interviews and hearings about the investigation, including with planned subpoenas. One future witness could include the former deputy director of the FBI, Andrew McCabe, Graham said. ""We're going to get to the bottom of it ... this stinks,"" Graham said. ""This is a sad episode on the history of the FBI."" Biden's camp has rejected the idea there were any abuses and pointed out that there was no way for administration officials to single out Americans in intelligence reporting because their names were hidden, or masked. They were only identified after requests for more information about who was talking with existing targets, Biden's campaign said. That practice is legal and takes place thousands of times per year. Trump and allies have made it the basis of political attacks against Biden and others from that era, as Cruz repeated at Wednesday's hearing. Biden, in turn, has blasted Trump and Republicans for what he calls their attempt to distract attention from the most pressing challenges of the day — first the coronavirus pandemic and now the national unrest over police violence. ""Sen. Graham sold his conscience in exchange for a better shot at winning his primary,"" a spokesman for Biden's campaign said Democrats, who are in the minority on the Senate Judiciary Committee, took up that theme on Wednesday, led by Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California. She also restated that the findings and much of the work of the Mueller era have been validated. Feinstein emphasized with Rosenstein that the infamous, never-verified Russia dossier was not used as the basis to charge anyone. And Rosenstein underlined what he called the important need to conduct investigations that might not necessarily lead to charges — and that in the case of the Mueller era, no Americans ultimately were charged with conspiring with the Russians who attacked the election. Republicans argue the mere fact of a continued investigation into Page — after evidence surfaced they argue should have quashed it — is improper even though Page was never charged. In Rosenstein's case, he signed a request to continue surveillance on Page based on work product that has since been repudiated by internal investigators and the secret surveillance court. Those details didn't become clear to the public — or Rosenstein, he said on Wednesday — until later. Graham said he accepts that explanation but wants to know why information being gleaned by lower-level investigators wasn't making its way to the leadership of the FBI or Justice. Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., tried to emphasize with Rosenstein that although the Page surveillance application process was flawed, none of the other surveillance conducted in the Russia investigation suffered from the same problems. The Page problems don't invalidate the rest of the Mueller work, Leahy argued. Other Democrats complained about the use of the time and energy of the Judiciary Committee to execute what Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, R-R.I., called a political errand for Trump. Graham defended what he called the need to excavate the decisions in the Russia investigation and, meanwhile, has sought to show the Judiciary Committee can keep many plates spinning at once.

Another was a man known as “Mr. Indianapolis,” a former star football player. Yet another was a federal officer working security during a protest. They are among those killed as protests have roiled American cities in the week since the death of George Floyd, a black man who pleaded for air as a white Minneapolis officer jammed a knee into his neck. The deaths have at times been overshadowed by the shocking images of unrest, from heavy-handed police tactics to violence, vandalism and arson. Tens of thousands have marched peacefully in demonstrations against police brutality and racism. Many of the people killed were African Americans, compounding the tragedy for black communities. Hundreds of others have been injured in the chaos, with police officers getting shot and protesters struck with rubber bullets. The death toll and circumstances of the killings are still being sorted out in many cities, but here is what we know so far: LOUISVILLE As police and the National Guard troops sought to clear a crowd Monday, they heard gunshots and returned fire, killing David McAtee, the owner of a barbecue restaurant. The mayor fired the police chief after finding out officers did not turn on their body-worn cameras. State police and the U.S. attorney also are investigating.

But we are releasing it to provide transparency. It does not answer every question, including why did he fire and where were police at the time he fired,” Schroeder said. The protests in Louisville have centered not just on Floyd’s killing but also the death of Breonna Taylor, a black woman killed in her home in Louisville in March. The 26-year-old EMT was shot eight times by narcotics detectives who knocked down her front door as they tried to serve a search warrant. No drugs were found. OAKLAND, CALIFORNIA A federal law enforcement officer was providing security at a federal courthouse during a protest when someone fired shots from a vehicle. Dave Patrick Underwood, 53, died and another officer was critically wounded. It was not immediately clear if the drive-by shooting was related to the protests, though the federal building’s glass doors were smashed and the front entrance was sprayed with anti-police graffiti.

The circumstances of Kelly’s death are murky, and no arrests have been made.

(KRQE) – Joseph Cotton, the President of New Mexico NAACP said he appreciates most protesters in New Mexico keeping things peaceful throughout the three protests in Albuquerque these past five days, but wants to reiterate the importance to everyone that violence and vandalism is not the answer. “Vandalism is not the solution, that’s not where we’re at now,” said Cotton. “That didn’t cause us to get to this point. So it’s unnecessary to do the vandalism, it’s unnecessary to do the burning.” Since George Floyd’s death in Minneapolis last week, Albuquerque has had three protests in just the past five days. While each protest in the metro has been mostly peaceful, after the protest on Sunday, some people created havoc downtown by breaking windows, spray painting buildings, and starting fires. Cotton said even though the offenders may have not been from the earlier protest, he wants to ensure people know that protests are not meant to incite violence, but rather to initiate conversations and positive change. “Let’s protest peacefully,” said Cotton. “Let’s take our voice to our leadership. Let’s sit down at the table and have a dialogue and have a conversation.” Cotton said there is no clear timeline on when these protests will end in the state and throughout the country. But said he’s fully behind them as long as they remain peaceful from both protesters and law enforcement. During these protests, police are seen blocking off streets for protesters to march and have also seen officers maintaining about a one-block distance from protesters. City officials said there were no arrests or reports of damage to property or injuries during Monday night’s protest. Related Content:",0.0

Murphy VA Medical Center. White’s wife Selinda Guerrero, a community organizer for Forward Together, and other organizers said that White’s Monday night arrest was retaliation for his organizing work. Guerrero posted a video on Facebook of White’s arrest. As he was taken into custody, White said, “There’s no jurisdiction. I’m being illegally arrested.” Moments after White was loaded into a police car, Guerrero can be heard saying, ""This is what retaliation looks like when we come out to defend our community."" After White is detained, several unmarked cars pulled out following the single police car. A warrant issued on Monday, a copy of which was obtained by the Daily Lobo on Tuesday, states that he was arrested for violating parole. At about 1 a.m. on Friday, May 29, police pulled White over as part of an investigation into a vehicle suspected in an earlier shooting near the site of Thursday’s protest on Central Avenue and Wyoming Boulevard. APD spokesperson Gilbert Gallegos said White is not a suspect in the shooting but that the car he was driving is evidence. White allegedly refused to identify himself, but an officer recognized him from previous interactions and knew he was on parole. Police officers then contacted the New Mexico Corrections Department’s Probation and Parole Division. That office determined that White was in violation of his parole. The arrest order states that White has had “multiple negative interactions with Albuquerque PD” in which he was “verbally combative, and failed to identify himself, as well as failed to follow lawful orders.” It goes on to state that White “failed to report police contact” and “was recently a suspect in an auto theft.” After being redirected several times, the Daily Lobo did not receive a comment from either White’s probation officer Elijah Langston or supervisor Edmund Vigil, who signed off on the arrest order. In the Facebook comments section, several people asked where they could send bail funds. In response, Guerrero wrote, “Unfortunately parole is administrative and there is no bail nor courts involved. Basically you are state property and they can take you anytime.” White’s warrant, which noted that detention was “necessary due to … a risk to self, the public, multiple violations of supervision conditions and absconding,” confirmed that he would be held without bail pending a parole hearing. White is being held at the Bernalillo County Metropolitan Detention Center. “The circumstances and timing of Clifton’s arrest are suspicious at best,” Barron Jones, senior policy strategist at the ACLU of New Mexico, told the Daily Lobo on Tuesday. “Thursday’s protest at Central and Wyoming, he helped organize that, so it’s weird.” Albuquerque Mayor Tim Keller’s office has not responded to Daily Lobo requests for comment as of the publication of this article.

Floyd died after being restrained by Minneapolis police officers. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci) MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Prosecutors charged three more police officers Wednesday in the death of George Floyd and filed a new, tougher charge against the officer at the center of the case, delivering a victory to protesters who have filled the streets from coast to coast to fight police brutality and racial injustice. The most serious charge was filed against Derek Chauvin, who was caught on video pressing his knee to Floyd’s neck and now must defend himself against an accusation of second-degree murder. The three other officers at the scene were charged for the first time with aiding and abetting second-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. All four were fired last week. If convicted, they could be sentenced to up to four decades in prison. Chauvin was initially charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Those charges still stand. The new second-degree murder charge alleges that Chauvin caused Floyd’s death without intent while committing another felony, namely third-degree assault. It carries a maximum penalty of 40 years in prison, compared with a maximum of 25 years for third-degree murder. The other officers — Thomas Lane, J. Kueng and Tou Thao — face the same maximum penalties for aiding and abetting. All three men were in custody by Wednesday evening. Chauvin was arrested last week and is still being held. The multiple charges against each officer would offer a jury more options to find them guilty. The charges were sought by Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, who called the protests unleashed by the death “dramatic and necessary” and said Floyd “should be here and he is not.” “His life had value, and we will seek justice,” said Ellison, who cautioned that winning convictions would be hard and said that public pressure had no bearing on his decisions. Hundreds of protesters were in New York City’s Washington Square Park when the charges were announced. “It’s not enough,” protester Jonathan Roldan said, insisting all four officers should have been charged from the start. “Right now, we’re still marching because it’s not enough that they got arrested. There needs to be systematic change.” Ben Crump, an attorney for Floyd’s family, called it “a bittersweet moment” and “a significant step forward on the road to justice.” Crump said Elison had told the family he would continue his investigation into Floyd’s death and upgrade the charge to first-degree murder if warranted. The move by prosecutors punctuated an unprecedented week in modern American history, in which largely peaceful protests took place in communities of all sizes but were rocked by bouts of violence, including deadly attacks on officers, rampant thefts and arson in some places. Nationwide, more than 9,000 have been arrested in connection with unrest. At least 12 deaths have been reported, though the circumstances in many cases are still being sorted out. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, speaking after the new charges were announced, said the state and nation need to “seize the moment” and use the wrenching events of the past week to confront the effects of racism, including unequal educational and economic opportunities. “I think this is probably our last shot, as a state and as a nation, to fix this systemic issue,” he said at a news conference. Also Wednesday, the Hennepin County Medical Examiner’s Office released the full autopsy report on Floyd, which noted he had previously tested positive for COVID-19, but was apparently asymptomatic. The report was released with the family’s permission after summary findings Monday that said he had a heart attack while being restrained by officers. President Donald Trump has pushed the nation’s governors to take a hard line against the violence. He again tweeted Wednesday: “LAW & ORDER!” An overpowering security force — including officers from the FBI Hostage Rescue Team, the Secret Service, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Bureau of Prisons and, according to a senior defense official, at least 2,200 National Guard soldiers — was out in force Wednesday as thousands of peaceful protesters demonstrated in the nation’s capital. Some remained near the White House while others marched toward the Capitol building. Military vehicles were parked on streets near the White House, and an array of agencies kept watch from the air. An FBI plane, an Army surveillance plane and a Park Police helicopter circled overhead. At one point near the White House, protesters began singing “Amazing Grace” as they knelt in view of law enforcement officers in riot gear. “We are not going anywhere!” they chanted. There were no signs of confrontations. Protester Jade Jones, 30, said the demonstrations would continue despite the new charges. “That’s the least they could do,” said Jones, who had been attending Washington protests for days. “It’s not going to wipe away 400 years of pain.” “We are glad there are additional charges, but that doesn’t mean justice has been served,” she said. More than 20,000 National Guard members have been called up in 29 states to deal with the violence. In New York City, where high-end stores were looted in earlier days, some retailers fortified their property. At the luxury department store Saks Fifth Avenue, windows were boarded up, then covered in chain-link fencing and razor wire. The front of the store was guarded by a line of tattooed men with dogs. There was scuffling in some parts of the city Wednesday night, but no signs of major clashes between protesters and police. The protests have also taken root overseas. In Greece, police fired tear gas after young people attacked them Wednesday outside the U.S. Embassy in Athens. Some 4,000 protesters had been peaceful until near the end of the demonstration, when some threw gasoline bombs and stones at police. No injuries or arrests were reported. Other protests were held Wednesday in London, Helsinki, Rotterdam and Bogota, among other cities. The anger over Floyd’s death has spilled into an array of racial issues across the U.S. In Philadelphia, for example, a statue of former Mayor Frank Rizzo was removed by the city Wednesday after repeatedly being targeted by vandals. Rizzo presided over a police force widely accused of racism and brutality in the 1970s. In Virginia, Gov. Ralph Northam was expected to announce plans Thursday for the removal of an iconic statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee from Richmond’s prominent Monument Avenue, a senior administration official told The Associated Press. The statue in the former Confederate capital has been the target of vandalism during the protests. ___ Associated Press journalists across the U.S. contributed to this report.",0.0

(AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin) WASHINGTON (AP) — A day after threatening states that he would dispatch the military to quell protests, President Donald Trump appeared to be privately backing off his threat to deploy troops, with White House officials saying this week’s response to demonstrations across the country indicated that local governments should be able to restore order themselves. The shift came as protests in Washington and other cities over police brutality against minorities proceeded Tuesday with relative calm, a striking contrast to the harsh crackdowns outside the White House on Monday night. The president wanted to make the aggressive action in the nation’s capital an example for the rest of the country, a senior White House official said Tuesday. The Defense Department has drafted contingency plans for how to deploy active-duty military if needed. Pentagon documents reviewed by The Associated Press showed plans for soldiers from an Army division to protect the White House and other federal buildings if the security situation in the nation’s capital were to deteriorate and the National Guard could not secure the facilities. But interest in exerting that extraordinary federal authority appeared to be waning in the White House. Though the crackdown on the Washington demonstrations was praised by some Trump supporters Tuesday, a handful of Republicans expressed concern that law enforcement officers risked violating the protesters’ First Amendment rights. The defense secretary also distanced himself from Trump’s decision to walk across Lafayette Park for a photo opportunity at a church after the demonstrators had been cleared. Pentagon Chief Mark Esper, who walked with Trump to St. John’s Church on Monday evening, insisted he did not know the president’s destination. “I didn’t know where I was going,” Esper told NBC News. He said he had expected to view damage to a bathroom facility that had been vandalized in Lafayette Park, across from the White House, and talk with National Guard troops positioned there. The protests have sprung up across the country following the death of George Floyd, a black man who died after a white Minneapolis police officer pinned him down and pressed Floyd’s neck with his knee. Violent demonstrations have raged in scores of American cities, marking a level of unrest unseen for decades. The situation in Washington escalated Monday, becoming a potent symbol of Trump’s policing tactics and a physical manifestation of the rhetorical culture war he has stoked since before he was elected. Nearly 30 minutes before a 7 p.m. curfew in Washington, U.S. Park Police repelled protesters with what they said were smoke canisters and pepper balls. “D.C. had no problems last night. Many arrests. Great job done by all. Overwhelming force. Domination,” Trump tweeted Tuesday, after a night in which heavily armed military forces and federal officers swarmed the city. Trump added, “(thank you President Trump!).” The clampdown on the protesters followed a weekend of demonstrations outside the White House. Trump had been furious about images juxtaposing fires set in the park outside the executive mansion with a darkened White House in the background, according to current and former campaign and administration officials. He was also angry about the news coverage revealing he had been rushed to the White House bunker during Friday’s protests. He moved to respond aggressively Monday. In an evening address in the Rose Garden, he called on governors to ramp up the National Guard presence in their states to tamp down the protests. If they didn’t abide by those orders, Trump said, he would dispatch the military to their states — a step rarely taken in modern American history. The federal government has provided all affected states with a list of National Guard resources available to them, the White House official said. The official added that Trump’s message to governors was that if they don’t use all the tools in their arsenal, they shouldn’t expect a sympathetic response to any request for federal dollars to help with cleanup and recovery down. On Monday, 715 soldiers from the 82nd Airborne Division arrived in the capital area in case the situation in Washington escalated. They are now stationed at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland and Fort Belvoir in Virginia. Two more 82nd Airborne battalions, totaling 1,300 soldiers, are on standby at Fort Bragg in North Carolina, according to the documents reviewed by the AP. The plan is named Operation Themis. The soldiers on standby in the Washington area are armed and have riot gear and bayonets. After the AP first reported the issuing of bayonets Tuesday, orders came down that soldiers would not need the knife-like weapons that can be affixed to rifles, according to two soldiers from the 82nd who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear they would be punished for commenting publicly. The idea that bayonets could be used in confronting civilians provoked an outcry on social media and among some members of Congress. Already administration officials were privately acknowledging that the Monday’s events didn’t serve the administration well. Some Republican lawmakers, who are typically in lockstep with the president or at least refrain from publicly criticizing him, said he had gone too far in appearing to use force to clear the way for his visit to the church. “There is no right to riot, no right to destroy others’ property, and no right to throw rocks at police,” said Nebraska Republican Sen. Ben Sasse. “But there is a fundamental — a constitutional — right to protest, and I’m against clearing out a peaceful protest for a photo op that treats the Word of God as a political prop.” Former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, said of Trump posing for photos holding up a Bible, “I just wish he opened it once in a while.” Trump’s Cabinet also played a role in what appeared to be an orchestrated event. It was Attorney General William Barr who gave the order for law enforcement to clear out the protest before Trump’s walk to the church and ahead of Washington’s 7 p.m. curfew. A person familiar with the matter said the decision was made earlier Monday, but had not been executed by the time Barr arrived in Lafayette Park to survey the scene Monday evening. He verbally gave the order at that time. After the demonstrators had been pushed out of the park, Trump emerged from the White House with several officials, including Esper and Gen. Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Senior defense officials told reporters Milley was also not aware that the Park Police and law enforcement had made a decision to clear the square or that Trump intended to visit the church. They had been in Washington to coordinate with federal law enforcement officials but were diverted to the White House to brief Trump on military preparations, the officials said. The White House, Defense, campaign officials and others with knowledge of Monday’s events all insisted on anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.",0.0

Floyd died after being restrained by Minneapolis police officers. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci) MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Prosecutors charged three more police officers Wednesday in the death of George Floyd and filed a new, tougher charge against the officer at the center of the case, delivering a victory to protesters who have filled the streets from coast to coast to fight police brutality and racial injustice. The most serious charge was filed against Derek Chauvin, who was caught on video pressing his knee to Floyd’s neck and now must defend himself against an accusation of second-degree murder. The three other officers at the scene were charged for the first time with aiding and abetting second-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. All four were fired last week. If convicted, they could be sentenced to up to four decades in prison. Chauvin was initially charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Those charges still stand. The new second-degree murder charge alleges that Chauvin caused Floyd’s death without intent while committing another felony, namely third-degree assault. It carries a maximum penalty of 40 years in prison, compared with a maximum of 25 years for third-degree murder. The other officers — Thomas Lane, J. Kueng and Tou Thao — face the same maximum penalties for aiding and abetting. All three men were in custody by Wednesday evening. Chauvin was arrested last week and is still being held. The multiple charges against each officer would offer a jury more options to find them guilty. The charges were sought by Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, who called the protests unleashed by the death “dramatic and necessary” and said Floyd “should be here and he is not.” “His life had value, and we will seek justice,” said Ellison, who cautioned that winning convictions would be hard and said that public pressure had no bearing on his decisions. Hundreds of protesters were in New York City’s Washington Square Park when the charges were announced. “It’s not enough,” protester Jonathan Roldan said, insisting all four officers should have been charged from the start. “Right now, we’re still marching because it’s not enough that they got arrested. There needs to be systematic change.” Ben Crump, an attorney for Floyd’s family, called it “a bittersweet moment” and “a significant step forward on the road to justice.” Crump said Elison had told the family he would continue his investigation into Floyd’s death and upgrade the charge to first-degree murder if warranted. The move by prosecutors punctuated an unprecedented week in modern American history, in which largely peaceful protests took place in communities of all sizes but were rocked by bouts of violence, including deadly attacks on officers, rampant thefts and arson in some places. Nationwide, more than 9,000 have been arrested in connection with unrest. At least 12 deaths have been reported, though the circumstances in many cases are still being sorted out. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, speaking after the new charges were announced, said the state and nation need to “seize the moment” and use the wrenching events of the past week to confront the effects of racism, including unequal educational and economic opportunities. “I think this is probably our last shot, as a state and as a nation, to fix this systemic issue,” he said at a news conference. Also Wednesday, the Hennepin County Medical Examiner’s Office released the full autopsy report on Floyd, which noted he had previously tested positive for COVID-19, but was apparently asymptomatic. The report was released with the family’s permission after summary findings Monday that said he had a heart attack while being restrained by officers. President Donald Trump has pushed the nation’s governors to take a hard line against the violence. He again tweeted Wednesday: “LAW & ORDER!” An overpowering security force — including officers from the FBI Hostage Rescue Team, the Secret Service, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Bureau of Prisons and, according to a senior defense official, at least 2,200 National Guard soldiers — was out in force Wednesday as thousands of peaceful protesters demonstrated in the nation’s capital. Some remained near the White House while others marched toward the Capitol building. Military vehicles were parked on streets near the White House, and an array of agencies kept watch from the air. An FBI plane, an Army surveillance plane and a Park Police helicopter circled overhead. At one point near the White House, protesters began singing “Amazing Grace” as they knelt in view of law enforcement officers in riot gear. “We are not going anywhere!” they chanted. There were no signs of confrontations. Protester Jade Jones, 30, said the demonstrations would continue despite the new charges. “That’s the least they could do,” said Jones, who had been attending Washington protests for days. “It’s not going to wipe away 400 years of pain.” “We are glad there are additional charges, but that doesn’t mean justice has been served,” she said. More than 20,000 National Guard members have been called up in 29 states to deal with the violence. In New York City, where high-end stores were looted in earlier days, some retailers fortified their property. At the luxury department store Saks Fifth Avenue, windows were boarded up, then covered in chain-link fencing and razor wire. The front of the store was guarded by a line of tattooed men with dogs. There was scuffling in some parts of the city Wednesday night, but no signs of major clashes between protesters and police. The protests have also taken root overseas.

Another was a man known as “Mr. Indianapolis,” a former star football player. Yet another was a federal officer working security during a protest. They are among those killed as protests have roiled American cities in the week since the death of George Floyd, a black man who pleaded for air as a white Minneapolis officer jammed a knee into his neck. The deaths have at times been overshadowed by the shocking images of unrest, from heavy-handed police tactics to violence, vandalism and arson. Tens of thousands have marched peacefully in demonstrations against police brutality and racism. Many of the people killed were African Americans, compounding the tragedy for black communities. Hundreds of others have been injured in the chaos, with police officers getting shot and protesters struck with rubber bullets. The death toll and circumstances of the killings are still being sorted out in many cities, but here is what we know so far: LOUISVILLE As police and the National Guard troops sought to clear a crowd Monday, they heard gunshots and returned fire, killing David McAtee, the owner of a barbecue restaurant. The mayor fired the police chief after finding out officers did not turn on their body-worn cameras. State police and the U.S. attorney also are investigating. McAtee was a 53-year-old African American man known for offering free meals to officers who stopped by his restaurant. in an attempt to disperse crowds, #DavidMcAtee, a louisville bbq chef known for serving cops free meals, was shot and killed by the police last night. he was unarmed. not only were the officers’ bodycams off, but they also left his body on the street for 12 hours. say his name. pic.twitter.com/kqOPku8iuQ — adaliah 🇹🇬 (@adxlls) June 2, 2020 “We lost a wonderful citizen named David McAtee,” Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer said. “David was a friend to many, a well-known barbecue man.” Acting police Chief Robert Schroeder said Tuesday that video from security cameras at McAtee’s business and an adjoining store showed McAtee firing a gun as officers approached. “This video does not provide all the answers. But we are releasing it to provide transparency. It does not answer every question, including why did he fire and where were police at the time he fired,” Schroeder said. The protests in Louisville have centered not just on Floyd’s killing but also the death of Breonna Taylor, a black woman killed in her home in Louisville in March. The 26-year-old EMT was shot eight times by narcotics detectives who knocked down her front door as they tried to serve a search warrant. No drugs were found. OAKLAND, CALIFORNIA A federal law enforcement officer was providing security at a federal courthouse during a protest when someone fired shots from a vehicle. Dave Patrick Underwood, 53, died and another officer was critically wounded. It was not immediately clear if the drive-by shooting was related to the protests, though the federal building’s glass doors were smashed and the front entrance was sprayed with anti-police graffiti. Dave Patrick Underwood was shot and killed in what appears to be a driveby shooting.

INDIANAPOLIS Two people were killed this past weekend amid unrest, including 38-year-old Chris Beaty, a former offensive lineman for Indiana University.

This death occurred the same night an 18-year-old man was fatally shot as protests erupted in the city. DAVENPORT, IOWA Police are investigating the deaths of 22-year-old Italia Kelly, who was shot Monday while leaving a protest outside a Walmart, and of a man found near where suspects exchanged gunfire with police in the city of 100,000 people across the Mississippi River from Illinois. The circumstances of Kelly’s death are murky, and no arrests have been made. Kelly and a friend were getting in a vehicle to leave because the protest had turned unruly when she was struck in the back by a bullet, said her aunt, Amy Hale of Atchison, Kansas. “She was always smiling, always laughing. That’s why it’s so sad that she was taken in such a violent way,” Hale said. “That is not Italia.

Police say they found a handgun underneath his body. His identity has not been released. Police said surveillance video shows that the man and some of the arrested suspects were involved in a shooting outside a jewelry store hours earlier. They were casing the business when other cars arrived and multiple people fired shots at each other and fled, police said. MINNEAPOLIS In what is believed to be the first killing since the protests broke out, Calvin L. Horton Jr. was fatally shot outside a pawn shop last week. The owner of the pawn shop, who is white, was arrested in the death of Horton, a 43-year-old black man. Police say they are investigating the circumstances of the killing, including whether it was related to protests in the neighborhood.

1624307501,2020-06-03 07:59:00,How Much Do We Need The Police?,https://www.krwg.org/post/how-much-do-we-need-police,en,False,,214420,krwg.org,http://krwg.org/,"One effect of the widespread protests across U.S. cities this week has been to renew discussions of what role the police should play in society. For many Americans, it goes without saying that the police are critical in maintaining public safety. Have an emergency? Call the police. But many others — especially black people and poor people — have long countered that the police pose more of a threat to their safety than a boon. See a police officer? Walk in the other direction. So it seems like a good moment to talk to Alex S. Vitale. He's the author of the 2017 book The End of Policing. In it, he argues that rather than focus on police reform or officer retraining, the country needs to reconsider fundamentally what it is the police should be doing at all. I spoke with Vitale about what roles police should and shouldn't play, what he makes of the current protests and what actual change in the way police in this country do their jobs might look like. Our conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity. One of the arguments you make in The End of Policing is that police are being asked to do too much. They're basically being tasked with addressing every social problem that we have. So what are police asked to do? And what should they be asked to do? One of the problems that we're encountering here is this massive expansion in the scope of policing over the last 40 years or so. Policing is now happening in our schools. It's happening in relation to the problems of homelessness, untreated mental illness, youth violence and some things that we historically associate police with. But the policing has become more intensive, more invasive, more aggressive. So what I'm calling for is a rethink on why we've turned all of these social problems over to the police to manage. And as we dial those things back, then we can think more concretely about what the rest of policing should look like and how that could be reformed. You brought up homelessness. In many cities police are tasked with dealing with people experiencing homelessness — but they don't have many options besides basically moving people or arresting them. Well, we've created this situation where our political leaders have basically abandoned the possibility of actually housing people. Which, of course, is the real solution, supportive housing for those who need extra support. But basically, we have a massive failure in housing markets that is unable to provide basic shelter for millions of Americans. So instead of actually addressing that fundamental problem, we have relabeled it as a problem that is the fault of the disorderly people who we label as morally deficient. And then we use police to criminalize them, to control their behavior and to reduce their disorderly impact on the rest of us. And this is perverse and unjust. So then it places police in this completely untenable situation, because they completely lack the tools to make this problem any better. And yet we've told them it's their problem to manage. ... Part of our misunderstanding about the nature of policing is we keep imagining that we can turn police into social workers. That we can make them nice, friendly community outreach workers. But police are violence workers. That's what distinguishes them from all other government functions. ... They have the legal capacity to use violence in situations where the average citizen would be arrested. So when we turn a problem over to the police to manage, there will be violence, because those are ultimately the tools that they are most equipped to utilize: handcuffs, threats, guns, arrests. That's what really is at the root of policing. So if we don't want violence, we should try to figure out how to not get the police involved. There are obviously a lot of people who agree broadly with the notion that the way that policing happens in this country is a problem and that there needs to be some sort of change. But they're pretty invested in the idea that police are needed to maintain public safety. People ask the question, without police, what do you do when someone gets murdered? What do you do when someone's house gets robbed? What do you say to those people who have those concerns? Well, I'm certainly not talking about any kind of scenario where tomorrow someone just flips a switch and there are no police. What I'm talking about is the systematic questioning of the specific roles that police currently undertake, and attempting to develop evidence-based alternatives so that we can dial back our reliance on them. And my feeling is that this encompasses actually the vast majority of what police do. We have better alternatives for them. Even if you take something like burglary — a huge amount of burglary activity is driven by drug use. And we need to completely rethink our approach to drugs so that property crime isn't the primary way that people access drugs. We don't have any part of this country that has high-quality medical drug treatment on demand. But we have policing on demand everywhere. And it's not working. Obviously, a big part of what is on people's minds right now is the role that police have in dealing with protesters, dealing with different types of political unrest. In your book, you talk a lot about the history of how police have been used to quell social unrest. Can you talk about that history a little bit? Well, I think that one of the myths we have about policing is that it is politically neutral, and that it is always here to sort of create order in a way that benefits everyone. But the reality is that America's social order has never been entirely equitable. We have a long history of exploitation of the Indigenous population, of African Americans through slavery, Jim Crow and today. And while we're not using police to manage slavery or colonialism today, we are using police to manage the problems that our very unequal system has produced. We're invested in this kind of austerity politics that says the government can't afford to really do anything to lift people up. We have to put all our resources into subsidizing the already most successful parts of the economy. But those parts of the economy are producing this huge group of people who are homeless, unemployed, have untreated mental health and substance abuse problems. And then we ask the police to put a lid on those problems — to manage them so they don't interfere with the ""order"" that we're supposedly all benefiting from. But if you're one of those poor people, one of those folks with a mental health problem, someone who's involved in black market activities to survive, then you experience this as constant criminalization. And would you say the same goes for people who are political protesters? Political protest has always been a part of this dynamic, right? Political protests are a threat to the order of this system. And so policing has always been the primary tool for managing those threats to the public order. Just as we understand the use of police to deal with homelessness as a political failure, every time we turn a political order problem over to the police to manage, that's also a political failure. I think the mayor of Minneapolis, for instance: Jacob Frey. He has consistently tried to frame this as a problem of a few bad apples. And he says, ""Why are you protesting? We fired them."" But this completely misunderstands the nature of the grievances. And instead of actually addressing those grievances, he's throwing police at the problem. Are the interactions that are happening right now between police and protesters something that you think is predictable? Or is this something new that we haven't seen before? It's not completely new; it's just the intensity of it compared [with], let's say, five years ago during the Eric Garner and the Mike Brown protests. What we're seeing is really an immediate escalation to very high levels of force, a high degree of confrontation. And I think part of it is driven by deep frustration within policing, which is that police feel under assault, and they have no answer. They trotted out all the possible solutions: police-community dialogue sessions, implicit bias training, community policing, body cameras. And it just didn't work. It didn't make any difference. And so they ran out of excuses. So the protests today are a much more kind of existential threat to the police. And the police are overreacting as a result. If we were to take serious steps toward moving in the direction of having police address fewer of our social problems and putting those problems in the hands of people who are actually more equipped to deal with them, what would be the next step? What is the next thing that we as a country have to push for? I think this will look like a series of local budget battles. And that's really what's going on across the country, is when we have these divest campaigns in places like Los Angeles and Minneapolis and New York and Durham, N.C., and Nashville, Tenn., and Dallas, Texas. These are folks who are saying concretely: ""We don't want police in our schools. We want that money spent in ways that help our children, not criminalize them. We don't want more money for overtime for narcotics officers. We want actual drug treatment programs, safe injection facilities, things that will help people."" So that's what this looks like. It's about rallying city council members and mayors around a new vision of creating healthier communities. When you're looking around at what's happening right now, what are the things that you think people need to understand to really process what is going on around the country? Well, I think the police are making the argument for us, right? People started this conversation by saying policing is out of control; they're not making the situation better. They have not been reformed. Well, now all you have to do is turn on the nightly news and see how true that is. The level of aggression and unnecessary escalation is stark evidence of how unreformed policing is, and I argue how unreformable it is. The question is whether or not people will take it to the next step and ask the tough political questions. Why are our mayors turning this over to the police to manage? Why are we using curfews instead of having conversations? Why are we throwing protesters in prison instead of trying to figure out what's driving all of this anger? ",0.0
1624318508,2020-06-03 07:59:00,How Much Do We Need The Police?,https://www.kunm.org/post/how-much-do-we-need-police,en,False,,146446,kunm.org,http://kunm.org/,"One effect of the widespread protests across U.S. cities this week has been to renew discussions of what role the police should play in society. For many Americans, it goes without saying that the police are critical in maintaining public safety. Have an emergency? Call the police. But many others — especially black people and poor people — have long countered that the police pose more of a threat to their safety than a boon. See a police officer? Walk in the other direction. So it seems like a good moment to talk to Alex S. Vitale. He's the author of the 2017 book The End of Policing. In it, he argues that rather than focus on police reform or officer retraining, the country needs to reconsider fundamentally what it is the police should be doing at all. I spoke with Vitale about what roles police should and shouldn't play, what he makes of the current protests and what actual change in the way police in this country do their jobs might look like. Our conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity. One of the arguments you make in The End of Policing is that police are being asked to do too much. They're basically being tasked with addressing every social problem that we have. So what are police asked to do? And what should they be asked to do? One of the problems that we're encountering here is this massive expansion in the scope of policing over the last 40 years or so. Policing is now happening in our schools. It's happening in relation to the problems of homelessness, untreated mental illness, youth violence and some things that we historically associate police with. But the policing has become more intensive, more invasive, more aggressive. So what I'm calling for is a rethink on why we've turned all of these social problems over to the police to manage. And as we dial those things back, then we can think more concretely about what the rest of policing should look like and how that could be reformed. You brought up homelessness. In many cities police are tasked with dealing with people experiencing homelessness — but they don't have many options besides basically moving people or arresting them. Well, we've created this situation where our political leaders have basically abandoned the possibility of actually housing people. Which, of course, is the real solution, supportive housing for those who need extra support. But basically, we have a massive failure in housing markets that is unable to provide basic shelter for millions of Americans. So instead of actually addressing that fundamental problem, we have relabeled it as a problem that is the fault of the disorderly people who we label as morally deficient. And then we use police to criminalize them, to control their behavior and to reduce their disorderly impact on the rest of us. And this is perverse and unjust. So then it places police in this completely untenable situation, because they completely lack the tools to make this problem any better. And yet we've told them it's their problem to manage. ...

Most Asian stock markets were mixed Thursday after Wall Street gain on surveys showing better U.S. jobs and manufacturing conditions than expected.

Stock markets have risen on optimism about a possible global recovery from the coronavirus pandemic as more economies reopen despite rising case numbers in the United States, Brazil and other countries. ADVERTISEMENTSkip ................................................................ Wall Street turned in its fourth straight gain after surveys Wednesday showed employers cut fewer jobs than forecast last month and a U.S. manufacturing downturn eased slightly. “The not too bad news keeps coming, enabling the hopes for economic rebound alongside the reopening,” said Jingyi Pan of IG in a report. The Nikkei 225 in Tokyo was up just under 0.1% at 22,631.01 and Sydney’s S&P-ASX 200 advanced 0.6% to 5,976.70. New Zealand and Jakarta also advanced. The Shanghai Composite Index lost 0.2% to 2,917.56 and the Hang Seng in Hong Kong shed 0.2% to 24,282.19 amid U.S.-Chinese tension over trade and efforts by Beijing to tighten control over Hong Kong. The Kospi in Seoul declined 0.2% to 2,142.53. On Wednesday, the Trump administration said it would suspend passenger flights by four Chinese airlines to and from the United States starting June 16 because Beijing has failed to approve a resumption of flights to China by United and Delta Airlines. On Wall Street, the S&P 500 rose 1.4% on Wednesday to 3,122.87. The index has gained nearly 40% since late March. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 2% to 26,269.89. The Nasdaq composite rose 0.8% to 9.682.91. A survey from payroll processor ADP said that private employers cut nearly 2.8 million jobs last month, but that was much milder than the 9.3 million that economists told investors to expect. That raises optimism that Friday’s more comprehensive jobs report from the U.S. government may also not be as bad as feared. Economists say it may show a loss of 8 million jobs, which would be a deceleration from April’s loss of 20.5 million jobs. ADVERTISEMENTSkip ................................................................ Other reports showed the U.S. economy is in bad shape but not as dismal as forecast. One report said services industries contracted by less than economists expected, and at a more modest rate than in April. Another report said factory orders dropped 13% in April, but not by as much as the 14.8% that economists had forecast. Companies that would most benefit from a growing economy led the market Wednesday, continuing a recent trend as hopes rise that the economy and life in general can become closer to normal as business-shutdown orders lift. Stocks have been climbing since late March, at first on relief after the Federal Reserve and Congress promised massive amounts of aid for the economy. More recently, the driving force has been optimism that growth can resume as states across the country and nations around the world lift restrictions on businesses intended to slow the spread of the outbreak. Widespread protests around the country following the killing of George Floyd haven’t dented the rally. One worry is that by bringing so many people together, the protests could also lead to more coronavirus infections. Many professional investors have been warning that the stock market’s rally may have been too much, too soon. The recovery for the economy is likely to be much slower than the sharp rebound the stock market has just undertaken, which could be setting investors up for disappointment. In energy markets, benchmark U.S. crude lost 68 cents to $36.61 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.

WASHINGTON — The National Guard of the District of Columbia is investigating the use of one of its helicopters to make a “show of force” against protesters near the White House, while President Donald Trump is encouraging authorities to get tougher to quell the unrest over George Floyd’s death. The helicopter, normally designated for use in medical evacuations, hovered low enough to create a deafening noise and spray protesters with rotor wash on Monday. The commanding general of the D.C. Guard, Maj. Gen. William Walker, said in a statement Wednesday that he directed the investigation, and officials The investigation comes as the federal government has promised to maximize its law enforcement presence in the nation’s capital. Scores of heavily-armed federal officers in tactical gear have been on the district’s streets for days, after demonstrators set fires, broke store windows and stole items from the shelves and left police officers injured. ADVERTISEMENTSkip ................................................................ The Trump administration has made an effort to show a use of force in Washington. Hours before a 7 p.m. curfew on Tuesday, cars were being stopped at military checkpoints downtown, and a cavalry of armored military vehicles could be seen driving through the district. Mayor Muriel Bowser said the administration had floated the idea of taking over the Metropolitan Police Department, a proposal she strongly rejected. She threatened to take legal action if the federal government attempted to do so. Two Defense Department officials said the administration had ordered military aircraft to fly above Washington on Monday night as a “show of force” against demonstrators. They were protesting the death of Floyd, a black man who died after a white Minneapolis policeman pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes even after Floyd stopped moving and pleading for air. Police made over 300 arrests, mainly for violating the district’s curfew. Earlier Monday evening, law enforcement officers on foot and horseback moved aggressively to clear protesters away from Lafayette Park near the White House before President Donald Trump walked to a nearby church for a photo opportunity. After participating in the show of force, Arlington County in Virginia pulled out its officers, saying they were used “for a purpose not worthy of our mutual aid obligations.” County officials said in a statement their officers never wielded their batons and did not fire rubber bullets or tear gas. After watching the scene unfold on live television, the police chief ordered all the officers to return to Virginia. Officials said they were reevaluating the mutual aid agreements to ensure officers “are never again put in a situation where they are asked to take action that is inconsistent with our values.” The U.S. Park Police said it gave three warnings over a loudspeaker before clearing the area of protesters, some of whom authorities said were becoming violent, throwing projectiles and trying to grab weapons. The agency said it used smoke canisters and pepper balls to disperse the crowd. Attorney General William Barr ordered law enforcement to clear the park and push back the perimeter around the White House when he arrived there Monday evening, before the president’s remarks, and that led to police using force to disperse protesters, a person familiar with the matter told The Associated Press. ADVERTISEMENTSkip ................................................................ Officials had decided the perimeter had to be moved by at least one full block, after fires were set in the park the night before, the person said. When Barr arrived, he was surprised it hadn’t been done and directed action to be taken, according to the person, who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. In a Monday call with governors, Trump and Barr encouraged more aggressive action against those who cause violence during protests. Trump said he was “taking immediate presidential action to stop the violence and restore security and safety in America.” The president urged governors to deploy the National Guard, which he credited with helping calm the situation Sunday night in Minneapolis, and demanded that similarly tough measures be taken in cities that also experienced spasms of violence, including New York, Philadelphia and Los Angeles. Between the protests and the response to the coronavirus pandemic, the National Guard has been deployed at its highest level in recent history, surpassing the number of troops sent to the Gulf Coast during Hurricane Katrina in 2005. More than 66,700 soldiers and airmen have been activated — 45,000 to assist with the pandemic and more than 17,000 to help with the protests. The Justice Department had deployed agents from every one of its agencies, including the FBI’s Hostage Rescue Team, an elite tactical unit, and riot teams from the Bureau of Prisons. The Park Police and Secret Service have had dozens of officers out in riot gear in Washington for the last few nights, in addition to the Metropolitan Police Department. U.S. Customs and Border Protection and other Homeland Security agencies were also dispatched. Most of the protesters have been peaceful and tried to discourage violence. Trump, Barr and others have tried to blame some of the civil unrest on left-wing extremist groups, including antifa, and other “anarchists.” Short for anti-fascists, antifa is an umbrella term for far-left-leaning militant groups that resist neo-Nazis and white supremacists at demonstrations. ___ Associated Press writers Zeke Miller, Lolita C.

Esper angered Trump when he said he opposed using military troops for law enforcement, seemingly taking the teeth out of the president’s threat to use the Insurrection Act. Esper said the 1807 law should be invoked in the United States “only in the most urgent and dire of situations.” He added, “We are not in one of those situations now.” After his subsequent visit to the White House, the Pentagon abruptly overturned an earlier decision to send a couple hundred active-duty soldiers home from the Washington, D.C., region, a public sign of the growing tensions with the White House. Then on Thursday, a defense official said the soldiers from the 82nd Airborne Division were heading back to Fort Bragg, North Carolina, after all. Former Secretary Mattis, a retired Marine general, lambasted both Trump and Esper in an essay in The Atlantic for their consideration of using the active-duty military in law enforcement — and for the use of the National Guard in clearing out a largely peaceful protest near the White House on Monday evening. “We must reject any thinking of our cities as a ‘battlespace’ that our uniformed military is called upon to ‘dominate,'” Mattis wrote, referencing quotes by Esper and Trump respectively. “Militarizing our response, as we witnessed in Washington, D.C., sets up a conflict — a false conflict — between the military and civilian society. “ Trump responded on Twitter by calling Mattis “the world’s most overrated General,” adding: “I didn’t like his ‘leadership’ style or much else about him, and many others agree, Glad he is gone!” Yet another former military leader, retired Marine Corps four-star general John Allen, said that events on Monday, the day Trump walked to the church, “may well signal the beginning of the end of the American experiment.” Allen, president of the liberal-leaning Brookings Institution, contrasted the routing of the protesters in Lafayette Park with remarks by Floyd’s brother, Terrence Floyd, who denounced looting that he said tarnishes his brother’s memory. Writing in Foreign Policy, Allen urged people to make their votes in November for the future of America’s democracy. “It will have to come from the bottom up. For at the White House, there is no one home,” he wrote. ADVERTISEMENTSkip ................................................................ Days ago, Esper had ordered about 1,300 Army personnel to military bases just outside the nation’s capital as Trump weighed whether to invoke the Insurrection Act and send active-duty troops into the city, the scene of large protests that devolved into violence and looting over the weekend. But after a night of calm enforced by a large deployment of National Guard troops and heavily armed federal law enforcement agents, defense officials said the troops would begin returning to their home base. Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy told The Associated Press that the decision was reversed after Esper’s visit to the White House. The White House didn’t respond to request for comment on whether Trump ordered the change. The shift added to confusion over the president’s threat to invoke the Insurrection Act for protests following Floyd’s death in Minneapolis. White House officials had indicated even before Esper’s comments that Trump was backing away from invoking the act, though officials said Trump was upset that Esper’s statement conveyed “weakness.” Press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said the president was still willing to deploy federal troops despite Esper’s comments. Meanwhile, the president was taking credit for the deployment of federal and other law enforcement officers to the nation’s capital, saying it offered a model to states on how to stop violence accompanying some protests nationwide. On Wednesday evening, troops and others were out in force in Washington. A Defense official said at least 2,200 National Guard members would be on the streets. Helmeted forces formed a ring around Lafayette Park across from the White House. Military vehicles were parked at intersections, also blocking access. Trump argued that the massive show of force was responsible for protests in Washington and other cities turning more calm in recent days and repeated his criticism of governors who have not deployed their National Guard to the fullest. ADVERTISEMENTSkip ................................................................ “You have to have a dominant force,” Trump told Fox News Radio on Wednesday. “We need law and order.” Pentagon chief Esper himself has come under fire from critics, including retired senior military officers, for having walked from the White House on Monday evening with Trump and others for a presidential photo opportunity in front of St. John’s Episcopal Church, which had previously sustained damage from protesters. “I was not aware a photo op was happening,” he said, adding that he also did not know that police had forcibly moved peaceful protesters from the park to clear the way for Trump and his entourage. Mattis, in his essay, called the scene an “abuse of executive authority.” The retired general quit the Trump administration in December 2018 after months of conflict with the president as Trump announced he was unilaterally withdrawing American troops from Syria. Though the crackdown on the Washington demonstrations was praised by some Trump supporters Tuesday, a handful of Republicans expressed concern that law enforcement officers risked violating the protesters’ First Amendment rights. The clampdown followed a weekend of demonstrations outside the White House. Trump had been furious about images juxtaposing fires set in the park outside the executive mansion with a darkened White House in the background, according to current and former campaign and administration officials. He was also angry about the news coverage revealing he had gone to the secure White House bunker during Friday’s protests. Trump on Wednesday acknowledged he visited the bunker Friday but claimed he was only conducting an inspection as protests raged outside the White House gates.

Some of them converged on Parliament and the nearby Downing Street office of Prime Minister Boris Johnson. A few scuffles erupted between protesters and police outside the street’s heavy metal gates. Inside, Johnson told a news conference that he was “appalled and sickened” by Floyd’s death on May 25 when a white Minneapolis officer, Derek Chauvin, pressed his knee on the handcuffed black man’s neck for several minutes. Earlier, “Star Wars” actor John Boyega, who was born in Britain to Nigerian parents and grew up in south London’s Peckham neighborhood, pleaded tearfully for demonstrators to stay peaceful. “Because they want us to mess up, they want us to be disorganized, but not today,” he said. Boyega recalled the case of Stephen Lawrence, an 18-year-old black man from southeast London who was stabbed to death in 1993 as he waited for a bus. The case against his attackers collapsed in 1996, and a government report cited institutional racism by the London police force as a key factor in its failure to thoroughly investigate the killing. “Black lives have always mattered,” Boyega said. “We have always been important. We have always meant something. We have always succeeded regardless and now is the time. I ain’t waiting.” Police appeared to keep a low profile during the demonstration and the ensuing marches. Earlier, the U.K.’s most senior police officer said she was “appalled” by Floyd’s death and “horrified” by the subsequent violence in U.S. cities. ADVERTISEMENTSkip ................................................................ Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick said the London force would “continue with our tradition of policing using minimum force necessary.” While the London protesters expressed solidarity with Americans protesting Floyd’s death, many also pointed to issues closer to home. “Racism is a pandemic,” said one placard at the London demonstration. Some of them carried placards saying “Justice for Belly Mujinga,” a 47-year-old railway station worker who died of coronavirus in April, weeks after an incident in which she said she was coughed and spat upon by a customer who claimed to be infected. Her death has come to symbolize the high toll the virus has taken on ethnic minority Britons and front-line workers — and, for some, social injustice. Police did not bring charges against the man accused of confronting Mujinga, saying an investigation showed he did not infect her and there was no evidence to substantiate a criminal offense. Johnson, who has sought to cultivate close ties with U.S. President Donald Trump, was asked what he would say to him. He replied: “My message to President Trump, to everybody in the United States from the U.K., is that … racism, racist violence has no place in our society.” Johnson said people had the right to protest but “I would urge people to protest peacefully, and in accordance with the rules on social distancing.” “Everybody’s lives matter, black lives matter, but we must fight this virus, as well,” he said. In other rallies around the world: ADVERTISEMENTSkip ................................................................ — More than 1,000 people protested in Stockholm despite a ban on gatherings of over 50 people due to the coronavirus, and while they expressed solidarity with U.S. demonstrators, participants were keen to emphasize that racial injustice was a problem in Sweden, too. One sign read “Make racism bad again.. Police said they had to use pepper spray and make one arrest. — About 3,000 people rallied in Finland’s capital of Helsinki, although they dispersed an hour later when the number of participants exceeded the 500 maximum allowed under virus restrictions. — In Cape Town, South Africa, about 20 people gathered at the gates of parliament and held up signs reading “Justice 4 George Floyd and Collins Khosa.” Khosa died a month ago after being confronted by soldiers and police in Johannesburg’s Alexandra township. Family members say he died after being choked and beaten, but a South African army investigation cleared the soldiers — a finding the relatives’ lawyers say they will challenge. — Police cut short a demonstration in the Dutch port of Rotterdam by thousands of protesters when the crowd got too big for coronavirus social distancing measures. Many of the London demonstrators appeared to ignore social distancing guidelines in the U.K., where people have been told to stay 2 meters (6 feet) apart. The coronavirus outbreak has exposed divisions and inequalities within the U.K. A government-commissioned report Tuesday confirmed that ethnic minorities in Britain experienced a higher death rate from the coronavirus than whites, but did not provide any recommendations on how to alleviate the risks. Figures from London’s Metropolitan Police also showed that black and ethnic minority Londoners were more likely than their white counterparts to be fined or arrested for breaking lockdown rules barring gatherings or nonessential travel. — Associated Press writer Gerald Imray in Cape Town, South Africa, and Raf Casert in Brussels contributed.",0.0

NEW YORK — Six of America’s late-night television comedy hosts — five of them white men — turned serious after the nation’s weekend of unrest following the death of George Floyd to suggest they and others need to do more than talk about racism. It has become a ritual — a somewhat inexplicable one, as TBS’ Conan O’Brien noted — for these comics to come on the air after acts of terrorism, school shootings or other national traumas to try and make sense of them for their audiences. Floyd died May 25 after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee into the handcuffed black man’s neck for several minutes, even after he stopped moving. “Today feels very different,” O’Brien said Monday night. “It doesn’t feel right to talk about my feelings of sadness and anger. That truly feels inadequate and somehow wrong.” Instead, O’Brien said it was important to listen to people who have direct experience with “our national crisis,” the fact that much of the black community in the United States doesn’t feel safe, seen or heard. ADVERTISEMENTSkip ................................................................ He brought on CNN’s Van Jones as a guest. That’s one thing O’Brien had in common with Stephen Colbert, Jimmy Fallon, James Corden and Seth Meyers: They all invited black guests or, in Corden’s case, collaborator Reggie Watts, to talk about the issue after saying their piece. Trevor Noah of Comedy Central’s “The Daily Show” brought a different personal experience, having grown up in South Africa with a white father and black mother. He offered a serious, expansive monologue that touched upon the coronavirus’ impact on minorities, the New York woman who recently told police she was being threatened by an African American man in Central Park, and George Floyd. To feel threatened by law enforcement feels to many blacks like they’re being held to a standard that some responsible for enforcing laws don’t adhere to themselves, he said. Noah said he understands the mentality that leads to looting when many whites can’t. “Try to imagine how it feels to be a black person when they watch themselves be looted every day,” Noah said, “because that’s what’s happening in America. Police in America are looting black bodies.” NBC’s Fallon, like all of the hosts speaking from home because of COVID-19 restrictions, noted how the Floyd story coincided with his own personal issues. Fallon recently apologized after stories emerged about how he appeared in blackface to impersonate Chris Rock in a 2000 “Saturday Night Live” skit. He said he was advised to keep quiet when people talked about him online, but he realized he had to talk about it. “What that small gesture did for me was break my own silence,” the “Tonight” show host said. “Staying silent was the biggest crime that people like me can do.” “We need to start saying ‘it not OK,’ more than just one day on Twitter,” said Fallon, who later spoke on the air with NAACP President Derrick Johnson. ADVERTISEMENTSkip ................................................................ Unlike the others, Colbert and Meyers mixed jokes into their monologues, but there was no mistaking their messages. Denying human rights and dignity for any people will ultimately destroy society, said Colbert, the late-night ratings leader on CBS’ “Late Show,” “Take it upon yourself to be a leader and set an example of the kind of country you want to live in,” he said. “That might mean going down to a protest or making a donation, or having a tense conversation about race. “You’re not going to get that from the White House,” he said. “So we need to step up and provide it ourselves. Because America is officially BYOP, bring your own president.” Meyers was sickened by the amount of money local communities spend on policing. “We spend more on the system that punishes and devalues black lives than we do on the things that reaffirm and value black lives and allows people to live lives of safety, decency and health,” he said. Corden, from Britain, seemed shaken on his CBS show. “I feel hopeless,” he said. “I don’t have the answers. But I do want to do more. I want to learn more and let that be a start.” ABC’s Jimmy Kimmel aired a rerun Monday.",0.0

LEE: ¿Cómo se propagan las protestas y por qué unas se tornan violentas? Además de las balas de goma, que a menudo tienen un núcleo de metal, la policía ha usado gases lacrimógenos, granadas explosivas, gas pimienta y proyectiles para controlar las multitudes de manifestantes que demandan justicia para George Floyd, de 46 años, quien murió después de que un policía de Minnesota se arrodilló sobre su cuello, mientras que otros agentes sujetaron su cuerpo. For anyone that wonders what a rubber bullet looks like. This was found by one of our photographers last night after the protest downtown. pic.twitter.com/jYuc8RojwG — Spencer Joseph (@SpencerJosephTV) June 1, 2020 VIDEO: Mujer queda en coma tras recibir disparo “no letal” de la policía Algunas manifestaciones pacíficas se han vuelto violentas, y algunas personas han roto ventanas, incendiado edificios y saqueado tiendas. El uso de balas de goma por parte de la policía ha provocado indignación, ya que las imágenes gráficas han aparecido en las redes sociales han mostrado a personas que perdieron un ojo o sufrieron otras lesiones después de ser impactados. Un estudio publicado en 2017 en la revista BMJ encontró que el 3% de las personas impactadas por balas de goma murieron a causa de la lesión. El quince por ciento de las 1.984 personas estudiadas resultaron heridas de forma permanente por las balas de goma, también conocidas como “proyectiles de impacto cinético”. Las balas de goma deben usarse solo para controlar “una multitud extremadamente peligrosa”, dijo Brian Higgins, exjefe de policía del condado de Bergen, Nueva Jersey. “Dispararlos en multitudes abiertas es imprudente y peligroso”, dijo el Dr. Douglas Lazzaro, profesor y experto en trauma ocular en NYU Langone Health. La semana pasada, una abuela en La Mesa, California, fue hospitalizada en una unidad de cuidados intensivos después de ser impactada entre los ojos con una bala de goma. El actor Kendrick Sampson dijo que fue alcanzado por balas de goma siete veces en una protesta en Los Ángeles. En Washington, la Guardia Nacional supuestamente disparó balas de goma el lunes para dispersar a los manifestantes pacíficos cerca de una iglesia histórica donde el presidente Donald Trump fue posteriormente fotografiado. En un comunicado, el secretario de Justicia William Barr defendió las acciones de los agentes de la ley locales y federales en Washington, diciendo que habían “hecho un progreso significativo en la restauración del orden en la capital de la nación”. LEE: Fiscal General fue quien ordenó represión contra protesta pacífica Barr no mencionó el uso de gas lacrimógeno o balas de goma. La fotógrafa independiente Linda Tirado dijo que fue cegada por una bala de goma en una protesta en Minneapolis.

No usamos balas de goma”. Idk what I thought a rubber bullet looked like but it wasnt this… These hoe ass police officers shooting people in the FACE with these!!?? pic.twitter.com/6egFzatRcA — THE BIG HOMIE (@DTDUNDUNITALL) May 31, 2020 Elder no mencionó la marca de las rondas de marcado de espuma utilizadas por la policía de Minneapolis. Pero un sitio web para “Ronda de espuma aplastable OC de 40 mm de impacto directo” muestra un producto verde con forma de bala descrito como una “ronda de fuego directo de punto de objetivo y punto de impacto”. El sitio dice que los proyectiles son “una solución excelente si necesita incapacitar a un solo sujeto o controlar una multitud”. Nadie sabe con qué frecuencia la policía usa balas de goma, o cuántas personas sufren daños cada año, dijo el Dr. Rohini Haar, profesor de la Facultad de Salud Pública de la Universidad de California-Berkeley y experto médico de Physicians for Human Rights. Muchas víctimas no van al hospital. No se requiere que la policía documente su uso de balas de goma, por lo que no hay datos nacionales que muestren con qué frecuencia se usan, dijo Higgins, ahora profesor adjunto en el John Jay College of Criminal Justice en Nueva York. No existen estándares acordados a nivel nacional para su uso. I was hit in the thigh by a nonlethal projectile (rubber bullet) while covering the protests last night in Des Moines. #GeorgeFloydProtests #desmoines pic.twitter.com/SEfcKDfTi9 — Bryon Houlgrave (@bryonhoulgrave) June 1, 2020 Cuando apuntan a las piernas, las balas de goma pueden evitar que una persona peligrosa o una multitud se acerquen a un policía, dijo Lazzaro. Pero cuando se dispara a corta distancia, las balas de goma pueden penetrar en la piel, romper huesos, fracturar el cráneo y explotar el globo ocular, dijo. Las balas de goma pueden causar lesiones cerebrales traumáticas y “lesiones abdominales graves, incluidas lesiones en el bazo y el intestino junto con los principales vasos sanguíneos”, dijo el Dr. Robert Glatter, médico de emergencias en la ciudad de Nueva York y portavoz del Colegio Estadounidense de Médicos de Emergencia. Disparar balas de goma desde la distancia disminuye tanto su fuerza como su precisión, lo que aumenta el riesgo de disparar a las personas en la cara o golpear a los transeúntes, dijo Lazzaro. Un llamado a prohibir las balas de goma Physicians for Human Rights, un grupo de defensa sin fines de lucro con sede en Nueva York, ha pedido que se prohíban las balas de goma. El ejército británico desarrolló balas de goma hace 50 años para controlar a los manifestantes nacionalistas en Irlanda del Norte, aunque el Reino Unido dejó de usarlas hace décadas. VIDEO: Policía es atropellado luego del resultado de autopsia de Floyd Las fuerzas de seguridad israelíes utilizan balas de goma contra manifestantes palestinos. La policía francesa fue criticada por usar balas de goma el año pasado después de que docenas de manifestantes de “chalecos amarillos” fueron cegados y cientos resultaron heridos. “Las balas de goma se usan casi todos los días en algún lugar del mundo”, dijo Haar. “Usarlos contra civiles desarmados es una gran violación de los derechos humanos”. Según Physicians for Human Rights, muchas armas policiales “menos que letales” pueden causar daños graves: Las armas acústicas, como los cañones de sonido que hacen ruidos muy fuertes, pueden dañar la audición El gas lacrimógeno puede dificultar la visión y la respiración El spray de pimienta, aunque es doloroso e irritante, no causa daño permanente, dijo Lazzaro Las bolas de spray de pimienta, que se han utilizado para sofocar protestas recientes, pueden ser mortales cuando se usan incorrectamente. En 2004, una mujer de Boston de 21 años fue golpeada en el ojo y asesinada por una bala de gas pimienta disparado por la policía para dispersar a las multitudes que celebraban la victoria de la Serie Mundial de la ciudad. Los dispositivos de desorientación que crean ruidos fuertes y luces brillantes, conocidos como granadas aturdidoras, pueden causar quemaduras graves y lesiones por explosión, incluido daño al tímpano. Las multitudes en pánico pueden causar lesiones por aplastamiento Los cañones de agua pueden causar lesiones internas, caídas e incluso congelación durante el clima frío La fuerza física, como golpear a alguien para someterlos, hace que aproximadamente 1 de cada 3 personas sean hospitalizadas, dijo el Dr. Howie Mell, portavoz del Colegio Americano de Médicos de Emergencia y exmédico táctico, que trabajó con los equipos SWAT. Las balas de goma son menos dañinas que someter a las personas por “fuerza física o balas regulares”, dijo Mell. “Pero esta semana disparamos mucho más de lo que usualmente hacemos”. A principios de esta semana, se creó una petición de change.org, pidiendo a las autoridades que ‘prohibieran el uso de balas de goma inhumanas’. La petición dice: “Durante la semana pasada, hubo protestas a nivel nacional en los Estados Unidos por el Movimiento Black Lives Matter, la brutalidad policial y la trágica muerte de George Floyd en manos de la policía de Minneapolis. “Hubo varios sucesos en los que la policía disparó a los manifestantes pacíficos con balas de goma, a pesar de que no hicieron nada malo para empezar. ¡Varias personas han resultado gravemente heridas por estas balas de goma! “Las balas de goma pueden ser extremadamente letales. Pueden causar fracturas óseas, lesiones en los órganos internos o incluso la muerte. Se ha demostrado que las balas de goma y plástico son demasiado peligrosas para el control de multitudes e incluso se han prohibido en varias regiones, incluidas Kosovo y Cataluña. “ Si deseas firmar la petición, clic aquí",0.0
