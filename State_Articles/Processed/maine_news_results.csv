1616194682,2020-05-25 10:37:25,Bees are friends to farmers,https://www.fosters.com/news/20200525/bees-are-friends-to-farmers?rssfeed=true,en,False,,661135,Sanford News,http://www.fosters.com/apps/pbcs.dll/section?category=SANNEWS,"BERWICK, Maine – Ellen Brooks, proprietor of Black Cat Bees in Dover, loves bees and she has a mission, sharing that love with the world. Brooks has her own hives in Dover, but she also will come and bring hives to farms, to help with their pollination, and to help support the bee population in New Hampshire and in Maine. She understands why bees are important to everyone who likes to eat. Orange Circle Farm in Berwick, located on Blackberry Hill Road, allowed Brooks to place four beehives on the 70-acre property. Jeff Benton and Erin Ehlers, owners of the farm, benefit because the bees will pollinate the plants on the farm. Brooks will maintain the hives, increasing the bee community in southern Maine. “Bees can range about five miles, so they do a lot of work,” said Brooks. “These are honeybees, Italian ones. Bees pollinate the fruits and vegetables we eat. Without them, our agriculture would not be successful. So, local farms with bees are really important to the production of local produce.” Bees are recognized as important on the Seacoast. Durham is a certified bee town and every year; pollinator educator events are held in conjunction with National Pollinator Week (June 22-28). Because of COVID-19, those events are canceled this year, as were any for World Bee Day on May 20, so Brooks said it is important that people keep bees in their thoughts. An environmental engineer, Brooks got interested in, then fascinated by bee colonies and how they work, how efficient they are. “Bees are something we can interact with,” said Brooks. “They and their health are a good indicator of how we are treating the environment.” Bees for a hive are ordered in “packages” of 10,000 bees and one queen. Honeycomb frames are placed in the hive and the bees will build on it. “We are super happy to have her here,” said Benton. “It seems like a pretty good place to have bees.” Benton said he and his wife have had the farm about two years. They bought it as open land and are slowly building a working farm, starting with vegetables and flowers, and hoping to soon add animals. The farm is a CSA, a community supported agriculture site. Brooks said there are about 106 CSA members, and said Ehlers is in the process of certification for the farm. “It’s a little overwhelming,” said Benton. “There is so much we want to do here, and we are not capable of doing it all ourselves. So, reaching out to people like Ellen is a great benefit to the farm and our desire for diversity. There is not a ton of farmland left on the Seacoast so it’s important to us to make this succeed.” People in a community can help support bees, even if they do not have hives. Brooks said they can build a pollinator garden, with flowers to attract bees. “They can leave clover and dandelions on the lawn a little longer,” said Brooks. “Bees love them, and they help them in the hive.” A hive is a self-contained community. Brooks can identify each type of bee and talk about their “job.” “The queen flies out of the hive only once in her lifetime,” said Brooks. “She flies out to breed. She will not breed in the hive in order to keep the bee population diverse. Once she breeds, she never leaves the hive again as bees only live six weeks. She can choose to lay fertilized or unfertilized eggs. The eggs hatch in 21 days.” Opening up a beehive is not nearly as frightening as in the movies. No cloud of bees swarmed out in protest. They were fairly placid, flying lazily about in a very non-aggressive manner. “I have been stung a few times,” said Brooks. “Usually it’s because I inadvertently grab one. They are generally docile.” The honey we all love is the byproduct of the nectar bees collect from flowers. Brooks said the bees dehydrate nectar until only 18% water remains. Then it becomes their primary food source.” Varroa mites are the enemy of bees. Brooks said every hive usually has a few but if the population reaches above 3%, the hive must be treated. She said it is a tricky undertaking, and not always successful. Anyone interested in learning more about bees can email Brooks at blackcatbees@gmail.com.",0.0

His wife, Eleana Tee Cobb, announced on Facebook that her husband died at his New York City home from lung cancer. He was 91. Born in Washington, D.C., Cobb told The Associated Press in 2019 he listened to jazz albums and stayed up late to hear disc jockey Symphony Sid playing jazz in New York City before launching his professional career. He said it was saxaphonist Cannonball Adderley who recommended him to Davis, and he ended up playing on several Davis recordings. But Cobb’s role as a drummer on the “Kind of Blue” jam session headed by Davis would forever change his career. That album also featured Adderley and John Coltrane. The album, released on Aug. 17, 1959, captured a moment when jazz was transforming from bebop to something newer, cooler and less structured. The full takes of the songs were recorded only once, with one exception, Cobb said. “Freddie Freeloader” needed to be played twice because Davis didn’t like a chord change on the first attempt, he said. Davis, who died in 1991, had some notes jotted down, but there weren’t pages of sheet music. It was up to the improvisers to fill the pages. “He’d say this is a ballad. I want it to sound like it’s floating. And I’d say, ‘OK,’ and that’s what it was,” Cobb recalled. The album received plenty of acclaim at the time, yet the critics, the band and the studio couldn’t have known it would enjoy such longevity. He and his bandmates knew the album would be a hit but didn’t realize at the time how iconic it would become. “We knew it was pretty damned good,” Cobb joked. It has sold more than 4 million copies and remains the best selling jazz album of all time. It also served as a protest album for African American men who looked to Davis and the jazz musicians to break stereotypes about jazz and black humanity. Cobb would also work with such artists as Dinah Washington, Pearl Bailey, Clark Terry, Dizzy Gillespie, Sarah Vaughan, Billie Holiday, Wynton Kelly and Stan Getz. He’d also release a number of albums on his own. He performed well into his late 80s and played in Albuquerque, New Mexico, in 2017, as part of the New Mexico Jazz Festival. Jazz fans from throughout the American Southwest came to pay their respects in what many felt was a goodbye.

1617028027,2020-05-26 10:17:45,Hong Kong braces for downtown protests on China-backed laws,https://www.pressherald.com/2020/05/26/hong-kong-braces-for-downtown-protests-on-china-backed-laws/,en,False,,366984,pressherald.com,http://pressherald.com/,"Hong Kong is bracing for what could be its biggest day of protests in months, with pro-democracy groups calling for a general strike against China’s latest moves to increase control of the city. Protests are planned for Wednesday near the Legislative Council building in central Hong Kong, where lawmakers plan to hold a hearing on a bill that would criminalize disrespect toward China’s national anthem. They are also fighting against China’s plans to impose a national security law that opponents fear will curtail essential freedoms and criticism of the Communist Party. The Hong Kong Confederation of Trade Unions, which represents 145,000 members, has called for a general strike. More than a dozen high school student groups have also issued a joint statement urging their peers — newly returned to campuses following months of closures induced by the coronavirus — to strike. The Communist Party “is blatantly targeting Hong Kong people’s revolution in the past year, spelling an end to the people’s democratic autonomy and freedom of expression,” they said in the statement, which was shared on the Facebook page of leading activist Joshua Wong’s pro-democracy group, Demosisto. “Hong Kong students will not be able to speak freely in the future and instead be scrutinized for every word and be at risk of incarceration.” Hong Kong’s police force has readied 3,500 riot officers in anticipation of the protests, local Cable TV reported, citing unidentified people. Television footage showed newly added metal and water-filled barricades near the city’s legislature, Central Government Offices and People’s Liberation Army garrison building. Chen Daoxiang, commander of the PLA garrison in Hong Kong, said Tuesday that the army “firmly” upheld the NPC’s plan. The decision “shows our firm determination in safeguarding the country’s sovereignty and territorial integrity,” Chen said in an interview with China’s official military news site. “The garrison will firmly implement China’s decisions and plans, comprehensively implement the ‘one country, two systems’ principle and discharge defense duties in accordance to the law.” The fresh round of protests comes days after Beijing announced it would bypass Hong Kong’s legislature to implement national security legislation banning subversion, secession, terrorism and foreign interference in the former British colony. Key details about the bill remain unclear. Reuters, citing unidentified people familiar with the matter, said Tuesday the legislation is set to block foreign judges in Hong Kong from handling national security trials. Central and city government security agencies would also set up in Hong Kong as part of the legislation, which is subject to change and expected before Hong Kong legislative elections in September, the report said. Despite criticism from foreign governments, Chief Executive Carrie Lam defended the security law Tuesday, asserting that local residents supported it. She said it was untrue that the new measure would ban street protests or calls for her dismissal, and pledged that Hong Kong’s freedoms would be preserved. She said earlier this month that the anthem bill would get priority in the city’s legislature. “We are a very free society, so for the time being, people have the freedom to say whatever they want to say,” she told reporters. “Hong Kong’s vibrancy and core values in terms of the rule of law, the independence of the judiciary, the various rights and freedoms enjoyed by people will continue to be there.” The announcement of the legislation last week rattled markets, generated criticism from foreign governments and prompted top U.S. officials — who have seen tensions with China increasingly worsen in recent months amid the coronavirus pandemic — to openly mull retaliatory action. It also brought protesters back on the streets Sunday for one of the largest protests in recent months, with riot police firing tear gas at demonstrators in a central shopping area in scenes reminiscent of last year’s unrest. Chinese officials say Hong Kong’s violent protests over the last year made the new legislation necessary. But human rights groups, the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong and the city’s bar association say the new security measures are vague, legally questionable and could endanger its reputation as a global financial hub. Pro-democracy politicians have called the law an unprecedented assault on the city’s unique freedoms under the “one country, two systems” principle by which China promised to govern Hong Kong when it returned to Chinese rule in 1997. The pro-democracy camp swept local elections last year and are expected to see their best ever showing at Legislative Council elections slated for September. Lam rejected that assertion on Tuesday, saying that the city has always triumphed despite previous rounds of international concern about its prospects since the handover. A survey by a pro-government think-tank showed roughly 58% of the 1,810 people polled “expressed understanding” of China’s decision to implement the national security law, according to a report by news website HK01. “In the last 23 years, whenever people worried about Hong Kong’s freedoms of speech, freedoms of expressions and protests, time and again, Hong Kong has proven that we uphold and preserve those values,” she said. “The best thing is to see the legislation in front of us and to understand why at this point in time Hong Kong needs this piece of legislation for the bigger benefit for the great majority of Hong Kong people.” Send questions/comments to the editors. « Previous Next » filed under:",0.0

Ah, and asked them to come in and conduct a federal investigation, which they have been on the ground there doing that. And so they will be taking, ah, uh, lead in this investigation. Advertisement President Trump says he asked FBI, Justice Dept. to expedite investigation after man died in police custody Mayor: Officer who put knee on man's neck should be charged Share Shares Copy Link Copy President Donald Trump called for justice Wednesday for the death of George Floyd after a police officer put his knee on the man's neck.It happened after a white police officer was seen on video kneeling on the neck of a handcuffed black man during an arrest, even after the man said he couldn't breathe and stopped moving.""At my request, the FBI and the Department of Justice are already well into an investigation as to the very sad and tragic death in Minnesota of George Floyd,"" Trump said on Twitter.""I have asked for this investigation to be expedited and greatly appreciate all of the work done by local law enforcement. My heart goes out to George’s family and friends. Justice will be served!""Meanwhile, the mayor of Minneapolis called Wednesday for criminal charges to be filed.Based on the video, Mayor Jacob Frey said he believes officer Derek Chauvin should be charged in Monday's death of Floyd. Chauvin and three other officers were fired Tuesday. The video recorded by a bystander shows Chauvin with his knee on Floyd's neck for several minutes as Floyd is on the ground with his face against the pavement.“I've wrestled with, more than anything else over the last 36 hours, one fundamental question: Why is the man who killed George Floyd not in jail?” said Frey, who is white.He later added: ""I saw no threat. I saw nothing that would signal that this kind of force was necessary.”But despite the officers' swift dismissals, whether the death will be considered a criminal act or something less, like excessive force, is a more complicated question that will likely take months to investigate.Protesters marched more than 2 miles Tuesday to the police precinct in that part of the city, with some damaging property and skirmishing with officers in riot gear who fired tear gas. The Star Tribune reported more conflict Wednesday night at the same precinct, with some protesters throwing rocks and bottles at police, who responded with rubber bullets and tear gas. The newspaper also reported looting at a Target store across the street from the station.Another demonstration unfolded on the street outside Chauvin's suburban home. An officer told protesters that Chauvin was not there. Red cans of paint were earlier spilled on his driveway, and someone wrote “murderer” in chalk at the end of his driveway. No one answered when an Associated Press reporter knocked on the door.Video: Aerials show protests in Los AngelesMany activists, citizens and celebrities called for criminal charges before Frey did. But Floyd's family and the community may have to wait months, if not years, before investigations are complete.Floyd family attorney Benjamin Crump, a prominent civil rights lawyer, called for peaceful protests.“We cannot sink to the level of our oppressors, and we must not endanger others during this pandemic,” Crump said in a statement. “We will demand and ultimately force lasting change by shining a light on treatment that is horrific and unacceptable and by winning justice.”Police Chief Medaria Arradondo, who rose to the top job after his predecessor was forced out following the 2017 shooting of an unarmed white woman by a black Minneapolis officer, urged protesters to “be respectful.” He said he was working to change the department's culture.“One incident can significantly bring people to doubt that,” he said.The chief defended the department’s use of tear gas to break up Tuesday night’s protests, saying officers used it only after some people broke into a secure area that gave them access to squad cars and weapons. Video: Protester falls off police vehicle (warning: graphic)Bridgett Floyd told NBC's “Today” show that the officers involved in her brother's death should be charged with murder because “that’s exactly what they did.” She said she had not watched the video, but she told ABC's “Good Morning America” that she does not understand ""how someone could possibly let an individual go out like that.""The FBI and state law enforcement were investigating Floyd's death, which immediately drew comparisons to the case of Eric Garner, an unarmed black man who died in 2014 in New York after he was placed in a chokehold by police and pleaded for his life, saying he could not breathe.In the Garner case, local prosecutors, the NYPD’s internal affairs unit and the Justice Department all finished investigations into the case before the officer was ultimately fired. Garner’s family and activists spent years begging for the officer to be removed.The officers in the Minneapolis case have not been publicly identified, though one defense attorney has confirmed he is representing Chauvin. The attorney, Tom Kelly, declined to comment further.The police union asked the public to wait for the investigation to take its course and not to “rush to judgment and immediately condemn our officers.” Messages left with the union after the firings were not returned.During Tuesday's protests, some chanted and carried banners that read, “I can’t breathe” and “Jail killer KKKops.” Some stacked shopping carts to make a barricade at a Target store across the street from the station.News accounts show Chauvin was one of six officers who fired their weapons in the 2006 death of Wayne Reyes, who police said pointed a sawed-off shotgun at officers after stabbing two people. Chauvin also shot and wounded a man in 2008 during a struggle after Chauvin and his partner responded to a reported domestic assault. Police did not immediately respond to a request for Chauvin’s service record.In Minneapolis, kneeling on a suspect’s neck is allowed under the department’s use-of-force policy for officers who have received training in how to compress a neck without applying direct pressure to the airway. It is considered a “non-deadly force option,” according to the department’s policy handbook.Two use-of-force experts told The Associated Press that the officer clearly restrained the man too long, noting that the man was under control and no longer fighting. Andrew Scott, a former Boca Raton, Florida, police chief who now testifies as an expert witness in use-of-force cases, called Floyd’s death “a combination of not being trained properly or disregarding their training.”“He couldn’t move. He was telling them he couldn’t breathe, and they ignored him,” Scott said. “I can’t even describe it. It was difficult to watch.”Police said the man matched the description of a suspect in a forgery case at a grocery store, and that he resisted arrest.The video starts with the man on the ground, and does not show what happened in the moments prior. The unidentified officer is kneeling on his neck, ignoring his pleas. “Please, please, please, I can’t breathe. Please, man,” said Floyd, who has his face against the pavement.Floyd also moans. One of the officers tells him to “relax.” Floyd calls for his mother and says: “My stomach hurts, my neck hurts, everything hurts ... I can’t breathe.” As bystanders shout their concern, one officer says, “He’s talking, so he’s breathing.”The man slowly becomes motionless under the officer’s restraint. The officer does not remove his knee until the man is loaded onto a gurney by paramedics.Several witnesses had gathered on a nearby sidewalk, some recording the scene on their phones. The bystanders become increasingly agitated. One man yells repeatedly. “He’s not responsive right now!” Two witnesses, including one woman who said she was a Minneapolis firefighter, yell at the officers to check the man’s pulse. “Check his pulse right now and tell me what it is!” she said.At one point, an officer says: “Don’t do drugs, guys.” And one man yells, “Don’t do drugs, bro? What is that? What do you think this is?”Floyd had worked security for five years at a restaurant called Conga Latin Bistro and rented a home from the restaurant's owner, Jovanni Thunstrom.He was “a good friend, person and a good tenant,” the restaurateur told the Star Tribune. “He was family. His co-workers and friends loved him.”___Associated Press writers Gretchen Ehlke in Milwaukee and Todd Richmond in Madison, Wisconsin, and Hearst TV contributed to this report.",0.0

And six months from now, the pandemic-fueled election may well wreak havoc with what’s left of American democracy. Every time Trump opens his big mouth, that dire November scenario seems more likely. As more states prepare for universal mail balloting – understandably, they don’t want citizens to risk their health by voting in person – Trump is becoming more unhinged. He clearly fears he’ll lose if mail balloting expands the size of the electorate. Voting should take place in person, Trump riffed, on Wednesday as opposed to “when they send you a pile of stuff and you send it back.” Voting by mail is “a very dangerous thing. They’re subject to massive fraud…tremendous illegality and fraud…It’s not a fair situation…A lot of things can happen…Common sense tells you massive manipulation can take place.” Trump, of course, is the last person who should be talking about “common sense.” The actual facts prove that mail ballot fraud is exceedingly rare. Hundreds of millions of votes were cast nationwide between 2000 and 2012, with five states (including Republican Utah) conducting virtually all-mail elections, yet the total of nationwide prosecutions for mail ballot fraud was 491. As two voting experts at the Brennan Center for Justice concluded after crunching the data, “It is more likely for an American to be struck by lightning than to commit mail voting fraud.” Trump’s tweets about Michigan and Nevada were also predictably packed with lies. The Michigan secretary of state has sent mail ballot applications to all registered voters, which Trump said was “done illegally.” In truth, the voters of Michigan, in a 2018 referendum, approved an amendment to the state constitution that gives everyone the right to vote by mail. Trump tried the same scam with Nevada, fuming in his tweet that Nevada’s secretary of state has sent out “illegal vote by mail ballots” – whereas, in truth, Nevada law clearly states that citizens can vote by mail for any reason. Trump somehow neglected to denounce Georgia, Iowa, Nebraska and West Virginia – four other states that are mailing ballots to all registered voters. Gee. Why isn’t Trump mad at them too? Perhaps (just a wild guess) it’s because those are red states where his re-election prospects are decent anyway – unlike in Michigan (which he won in 2016 by a razor-thin margin and is now trailing Joe Biden) and blue-trending Nevada (which he lost in 2016 by only three points, and is now trailing Biden). He’s so panicked about Michigan and Nevada that he threatened to withhold congressionally-mandated money from both states. That action would be unconstitutional, because the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1987 that only Congress can impose conditions on a state’s receipt of federal money – before a state agrees to take the money. And if Trump’s threat sounds vaguely familiar – remember when he threatened to withhold promised military aid to Ukraine unless Ukraine helped him rig the 2020 election against Biden? The people who rightly impeached Trump last winter warned that if he was let off the hook he’d pull the same crap again. Presto! So what do Trump’s latest tirades tell us? Basically, that he’s terrified of losing in November. So he’s clearly trying to lay the groundwork for denying defeat. The big danger for our democracy – especially if the national vote count is slow, thanks to the surge of mail ballots – is that his cultists will take up the cause. “Democracy depends upon the losers of an election accepting the election results as legitimate and agreeing to regroup to fight to regain political power in the next election,” Rick Hansen, one of the nation’s top ballot experts, wrote in the Washington Post. “If large numbers of voters believe the winning side cheated in elections, we could have unrest and resistance to lawful government orders.” I’m reminded of the famous scene in Citizen Kane, when the demagogic mogul faced an electoral defeat, and his newspaper spun the loss with a headline it had prepared in advance: FRAUD AT POLLS!

Like any politician, humans aren't the only ones in the middle of an election cycle. One small town in Vermont appoints a mayor of the four legged variety. Meet Lincoln, a Nubian goat and the first pet mayor of Fair Haven, Vermont, elected to office in 2019. Her campaign caused quite the international stir. I got a phone call from Paris. They wanted to know what was going on. And then this year we made the A rumor times in 2019 the first round of the Pet Mayor race. Just because I think it was the first time this was happening. Word spread, especially in France. They were very interested to know what was happening. What's going on? Why's there go being the mayor? Liz Strep, a a reporter for New Station My NBC five covered the goat mayors rise to political fame and her 2020 bid for re election. But don't worry, Fairhaven isn't actually taking executive orders from a goat. The idea electing an animal mayor really started because the school needed a new playground, their playgrounds. I think 30 years old, it's just really not safe. This slide has a big hole in it, and it's just going down. So as a fund raiser, Teoh get a new playground. They thought of this idea. You know, why don't you let a pet mayor and that will spark donations? That's really their only platform, that these candidates are running forest to raise money. So these animals really aren't making any major decisions in the town. They're really more of a mascot to encourage people to donate money to those students. A new playground Last year's election was pretty small. There were, I believe, three candidates. Lincoln ended up winning. She was a young, spunky little goat, very friendly. So I think that really helped her win that election. Lincoln's first days Mayer was very official, though politicians on four legs do come with their challenges. Last year, Lincoln was attending her swearing in ceremony. She had a little bit of an accident. She lost some for marbles. I guess you could say over things a little bit of a commotion there, but it was very entertained. She made her mark. You could say that wasn't one of her final. She, I guess, had a pretty successful first term, which is why she was seeking re election this year. The pet election turned out to be a huge hit both in and out of Fairhaven. So when the 2020 cycle began, competition was fierce because last year was such a big success. And there was so much publicity about Lincoln becoming the town's first pet mayor. A lot of students in the Fairhaven grade school wanted to nominate their own pets, so we had a bunny, a hamster old horse. I think there were five or six dogs. Five acts. There were 18 candidates. There were three main candidates that stood out to voters. Lincoln, the incumbent goat, Sammy, the police canine. And Murphy, the therapy dog. Lincoln at a very successful first term as mayor being an incumbent. A lot of people knew her name already that she was definitely a front runner. She raised. I think, about 1000 or so dollars for the playground, but the goal is $80,000. They really need to raise a lot more money. Murphy thinks reading is important for kids. He thinks having a safe place to play and be outside and get off their phones. This has important. Murphy, a therapy dog, volunteers at the Bear Even grade school, so students were already very familiar with Murphy and Spur. These owner also had several fund raisers during his campaign, though he raised about $500 before the actual town meeting day vote for the school's playground. We were amazed that we were able to raise that much. And then there, Sammy, but police canine Sammy was actually a rescue dog. All the kids were very from there with her, and they're always I wanted her to come in and pay a visit. Do you get to vote today? Welcome to the election stuff Surveying the voters at the polls. A lot of them were very interested in what the name of the animal waas, but also how cute they were. Why do you want to be the war? Said She's so you want 4 to 9 semi because he's true. Why did you want pizzazz? He's cute, and she likes the log on leashes out polling place on town meeting day. A few of the candidates were outside kind of doing a meet and greet with the kids, though I think that could have swayed some of the undecided voters if they had a good experience. He's feeling great. You got to greet all the kids coming to vote. So it was his day. Well, I think she's hungry. That's about yet She's been nibbling on the building. It's a different sort of a day for Everybody Loves Dogs. And then there's even a greater population of love. Police K Nights, Theo Day after a town meeting day, I was in the classroom with a bunch of eighth graders who are counting ballots, and we were there as the results came in. I won't Lincoln doing because I wanted Lincoln personally because he leaves a lot of money for the playground. Last year, I will say this. Eighth grade class WAAS Chris Stan's Class Kristan is Lincoln's owner, so they were a little biased. They really, really were pretty for Lincoln to win. It's my pleasure to announce the winner of the mayoral race fair in Vermont this year. There are a winner is Murphy the dog with 146 votes. When it was announced over the speaker that Murphy had one, there was a little bit of the side. They were a little disappointed, but it didn't take long for them to start cheering and applauding for Murphy. They were very excited that passing the torch on and it's a new year. I think they're looking forward to seeing what Murphy will do with his mayoral seat. I think Murphy will do a great job with the playground fun, so I really wanted him from that store sampling to win. Yeah, I asked him. He didn't care, but he's a new playground and an excuse to see adorable animals weren't the only benefits to the 2020 pet election. The kids were able to learn valuable lessons about exercising their voting rights. Your vote is your voice in the Democratic process. You have a lifetime of voting ahead of you, and I have to take that chance. Every opportunity you get. At the end of the day, this whole pet mayor raises to raise money for the playground, but also to really introduce kids to the importance of voting and taking election seriously, getting to the voting booth and making your voice heard. That's a right that we all have. You know, where U. S citizens and starting that process really early and getting Kate's excited about this process. That's really built goal of all of this. It doesn't matter who wins the playground, the kids, that's what it's about. They haven't reached their goal yet for the playground, but they're really helping that. Murphy can pulls through and get a lot of donations during his time as mayor. And, of course, we had to know. Will this small Vermont town ever hand over the mayoral office to a human? I don't think that there haven will have a human mayor anytime soon. Because Fairhaven has a human town manager, which is essentially sort of the same thing as a mayor. He makes a lot of the big decisions. He oversees that select board. So I think the town government is free, comfortable with just having a town manager. But I think they also really love having a pet mayor. If you'd like to donate to the Fairhaven Grade School Playground Fund, check out the link to the go Fund me in the description box.

Some people could be seen throwing water bottles at police.The officers were stationed above the crowd on the steps of the police station and a raised section of Interstate 35.Unlike Dallas, where police made dozens of arrests to enforce a downtown curfew, Austin doesn’t have a curfew and demonstrators have been roaming downtown from the police station to the state Capitol several blocks away for nearly 10 hours. The crowd has ebbed and flowed from a few thousand to a few hundred.Demonstrators could not get on the Capitol grounds, which were protected by a large police presence.12: 45 a.m. ETDENVER — Police fired tear gas and projectiles at demonstrators defying a Denver curfew Sunday night following a day of peaceful marching and chants of “Don’t shoot” alongside boarded-up businesses that had been vandalized the night before.Dozens of demonstrators, some throwing fireworks, taunted police and pushed dumpsters onto Colfax Avenue, a major artery, in the sporadic confrontations that occurred east of downtown. The demonstration over the death of George Floyd came after turbulent protests that led to the arrest of 83 people Saturday night.Denver Mayor Michael Hancock called the behavior of unruly protesters “reckless, inexcusable and unacceptable.”12 a.m. ETWASHINGTON D.C. — As demonstrations continued past an 11 p.m. curfew, D.C. police said they were responding to multiple fires that were “intentionally set” around the city. One was at St. John’s Episcopal Church, which is located across Lafayette Park from the White House.The church says every president beginning with James Madison, “until the present,” has attended a service at the church, giving it the nickname, “the church of presidents.”The first services at the church were held in 1816, according to its website.10:55 p.m. ETWASHINGTON D.C. — Protesters started fires near the White House as tensions with police mounted during a third straight night of demonstrations held in response to the death of George Floyd at police hands in Minnesota.An hour before the 11 p.m. curfew, police fired a major barrage of tear gas stun grenades into the crowd of more than 1,000 people, largely clearing Lafayette Park across the street from the White House and scattering protesters into the street.Protesters piled up road signs and plastic barriers and lit a raging fire in the middle of H Street. Some pulled an American flag from a nearby building and threw it into the blaze. Others added branches pulled from trees. A cinder block structure, on the north side of the park, that had bathrooms and a maintenance office, was engulfed in flames.Several miles north, a separate protest broke out in Northwest D.C., near the Maryland border. The Metropolitan Police Department says there were break-ins at a Target and a shopping center that houses Neiman Marcus, Saks Fifth Avenue Men’s Store, T.J. Maxx, a movie theater and specialty stores. Police say several individuals have been detained. 10:35 p.m. ETATLANTA — Riot police firing volleys of tear gas dispersed hundreds of demonstrators as a curfew took hold Sunday night, scattering a crowd that had protested for hours in downtown Atlanta over the deaths of George Floyd in Minnesota and Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia.Hundreds of police, National Guard troops and other forces lined up in positions around downtown Centennial Park, a focal point of the weekend of protests.An overnight curfew took hold at 9 p.m. as some on the fringes of what was a largely peaceful afternoon protest were setting off fireworks and burning construction materials near the park. An Associated Press photographer saw police then begin firing many 40 millimeter canisters of tear gas toward the crowd. People were choking, gasping and some throwing up as they scattered, leaving only a few still in the streets.As police and National Guard troops took up positions with plastic shields on major streets, crowds melted away. WSB-TV showed footage about an hour later of officers taking people who lingered in the streets into custody, using plastic ties to handcuff them on street corners. 10:05 p.m. ETBIRMINGHAM - People have damaged a confederate monument in Birmingham, Alabama. It's unclear who is taking part, but people were using tools and rocks to chip away at the concrete monument in Linn Park. 9:40 p.m. ETBOSTON —Boston Police were seen using pepper spray and hitting a man with a baton after officers were pelted with water bottles and other objects.Crowds had been gathered in the city throughout the day, however, the atmosphere in Boston changed dramatically after sunset.The glass door and window of a shoe store were smashed during the violence.Bricks and rocks were also thrown at police in another area, officers told WCVB.

""So I don't see a distinction any different."" Chauvin was charged with third-degree murder and second degree manslaughter. Three other officers were also fired from the department in relation to the incident. When speaking directly to the Floyd family, Arradondo removed his cap and said, in part, ""I would say to the Floyd family that I am absolutely devastatingly sorry for their loss.

Shields called it “really shocking to watch.”Officials say the incident came to light via video that circulated online.It shows a group of police officers in riot gear and gas masks surround a car being driven by a man with a woman in the passenger seat. The officers pull the woman out and appear to use a stun gun on the man. They use zip-tie handcuffs on the woman on the ground.Local reporters, who captured footage of the incident, said the police had earlier broken the glass on the car. A reporter said police also flattened the tires. 6:48 p.m. ETMINNEAPOLIS — Former Minneapolis police Officer Derek Chauvin, who faces charges in the death of George Floyd, was moved to the Hennepin County Jail Sunday, Hennepin County Sheriff's Office spokesperson Jeremy Zoss confirmed to CNN in an email.The Hennepin County Jail phone system and website also show Chauvin was moved to the Hennepin County Jail Sunday.Chauvin was initially booked in the Ramsey County Jail due to potential threats to Hennepin County Facilities, according to Bureau of Criminal Apprehension spokesperson Jill Oliveira.""The BCA communicated with the Hennepin County Sheriff's Office, which was dealing with potential threats to their facilities at the time of the arrest, they directed us to book him into the Ramsey County Jail,"" Oliveira told CNN Sunday.6:40 p.m. ETDENVER — Demonstrators filled the streets of downtown Denver again Sunday, marching peacefully and chanting “Don't shoot"" as they walked past boarded-up businesses that had been vandalized the night before.

They chanted for justice in Memphis. They stopped freeway traffic in Los Angeles. The death of George Floyd continued to ripple across the U.S. on Wednesday night as the calls became louder for the arrest of the white police officer who knelt on his neck for several minutes in a horrifying video that spread across social media this week. Meanwhile on Thursday, Ben Crump, attorney for Floyd's family, warned any instigators of violence in the Minneapolis protests: ""We don't need that. We need people focused on getting justice,"" he said. He is calling for an independent autopsy, saying he doesn't trust the city of Minneapolis. ""They offered him no humanity while keeping his knee on his neck. Members of the public were the only ones trying to de-escalate the situation. Not the police,"" Crump told CNN on Thursday. ""Keeping the knee on the neck for over 8 minutes – that is unconscionable."" While hundreds of protesters took to the streets, police chiefs from coast to coast expressed their outrage with Floyd's death. ""Do not defend the undefendable, attempt to justify the unjustifiable or excuse the inexcusable,"" Miami Police Chief Jorge Colina said on Twitter. ""George Floyd should be alive today."" ""The lack of compassion, use of excessive force, or going beyond the scope of the law, doesn't just tarnish our badge – it tears at the very fabric of race relations in this country,"" Los Angeles Police Chief Michel Moore said in a statement posted to Twitter. Minneapolis: Police, protesters clash; looters raid Target, Dollar Tree, other stores Protests in Minneapolis devolved into chaos on Wednesday night. Reports of fires came from around the city and videos of looters inside of stores quickly spread on social media. Several people shared video of people taking products from a local Target. A Cub Foods, a Dollar Tree and an AutoZone store also showed signs of damage and looting, and windows of businesses in nearby strip malls were reported to be smashed out. At least one person was killed. Police spokesman John Elder told USA TODAY that the department was investigating a homicide near the area where a reporter from the Star Tribune newspaper tweeted that a looter had been shot and killed by a pawn shop owner. One person was in custody early Thursday, the Star Tribune reported, but police wouldn't confirm if the victim was a looter. “The facts of what led up to the shooting are still being sorted out. We are truly in the infancy of this investigation,” Elder said. As the protests stretched into the evening, Police Chief Medaria Arradondo urged calm. In an interview with KMSP-TV, he noted the internal investigation as well as the FBI’s investigation of Floyd’s death and said they offer a chance at justice. “Justice historically has never come to fruition through some of the acts we’re seeing tonight, whether it’s the looting, the damage to property or other things,” he said. Memphis: George Floyd's death was 'nail in the unfortunate coffin for America' A silent demonstration to protest the death of Floyd, as well as Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery, turned into verbal confrontations with Memphis police and counter-protesters. The rally began with about 40 people holding signs reading “Black Lives Matter,” “Stop killing black people” and “Silence is violence.” Protesters were largely silent, with occasional chants of “no justice, no peace” and the names of black men and women who had been killed by police officers. Passing drivers — and one ambulance — honked in support and waved or gave thumbs-up. Within an hour, however, the protesters were met by two counter-protesters, who identified themselves as members of the Facebook group Confederate 901. Theryn C. Bond, a prominent local activist and former Memphis City Council candidate, confronted the counter-protesters, who occasionally jeered at the crowd to ""go out for a jog"" — a reference to Aubrey's slaying. ""I was so impressed to see so many white allies,"" Bond said. ""Because sometimes we think, 'Everybody doesn't get it.' And I think with the recent murder of George Floyd by police... I think this was the proverbial nail in the unfortunate coffin for America to really understand what we mean when we say, 'Black Lives Matter.'"" Floyd's death this week is the latest in a string of violence against black people. Taylor was shot and killed in her Kentucky home by officers executing a ""no-knock"" search warrant, while Arbery was shot and killed while jogging after being pursued by two white men who later said they thought he was a burglary suspect.

Taylor was shot and killed in her Kentucky home by officers executing a ""no-knock"" search warrant, while Arbery was shot and killed while jogging after being pursued by two white men who later said they thought he was a burglary suspect. Los Angeles: Protesters block 101 freeway, smash windows of California Highway Patrol cruisers Hundreds of people protesting Floyd's death while in police custody blocked a Los Angeles freeway and shattered windows of California Highway Patrol cruisers in a rally organized by Black Lives Matter. Demonstrators gathered in the late afternoon on downtown streets and, eventually, dozens of them moved onto U.S. 101 despite police efforts to keep them from walking into the lanes. When a CHP patrol car arrived, demonstrators surrounded it. The car's window was smashed and it jerked forward and moved away with several protesters who had jumped onto the hood. Television news footage showed one man finally hopping or jumping from the side of the moving car and then flopping onto the ground. A second CHP car arrived and was attacked, with one demonstrator hurling what appeared to be a wooden skateboard through the back window before it moved off. At its rally's peak, hundreds of people gathered outside the Los Angeles County Hall of Justice. The demonstration was mostly peaceful and no arrests were immediately made, Los Angeles police Officer Mike Lopez said. Contributing: Corinne S. Kennedy, Micaela A.

A police spokesman confirmed late Thursday that staff had evacuated the 3rd precinct station, the focus of many of the protests, “in the interest of the safety of our personnel” shortly after 10 p.m. Livestream video showed the protesters entering the building, where fire alarms blared and sprinklers ran as blazes were set. Protesters could be seen setting fire to a Minneapolis Police Department jacket and cheering. Protests first erupted Tuesday, a day after Floyd’s death in a confrontation with police captured on widely seen citizen video. On the video, Floyd can be seen pleading that he can’t breathe as Officer Derek Chauvin, who is white, kneels on his neck. As minutes pass, Floyd slowly stops talking and moving. The 3rd Precinct covers the portion of south Minneapolis where Floyd died. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz earlier Thursday activated the National Guard at the Minneapolis mayor’s request, but it wasn’t immediately clear when and where the Guard was being deployed, and none could be seen during protests in Minneapolis or St. Paul. The Guard tweeted minutes after the precinct burned that it had activated more than 500 soldiers across the metro area. . Earlier Thursday, dozens of businesses across the Twin Cities boarded up their windows and doors in an effort to prevent looting, with Minneapolis-based Target announcing it was temporarily closing two dozen area stores. Minneapolis shut down nearly its entire light-rail system and all bus service through Sunday out of safety concerns. In St. Paul, clouds of smoke hung in the air as police armed with batons and wearing gas masks and body armor kept a watchful eye on protesters along one of the city’s main commercial corridors, where firefighters also sprayed water onto a series of small fires. At one point, officers stood in line in front of a Target, trying to keep out looters, who were also smashing windows of other businesses. Hundreds of demonstrators returned Thursday to the Minneapolis neighborhood at the center of the violence, where the nighttime scene veered between an angry protest and a street party. At one point, a band playing in a parking lot across from the 3rd Precinct broke into a punk version of Bob Marley’s “Redemption Song.” Nearby, demonstrators carried clothing mannequins from a looted Target and threw them onto a burning car. Later, a building fire erupted nearby. But elsewhere in Minneapolis, thousands of peaceful demonstrators marched through the streets calling for justice. Floyd’s death has deeply shaken Minneapolis and sparked protests in cities across the U.S. Local leaders have repeatedly urged demonstrators to avoid violence. “Please stay home. Please do not come here to protest. Please keep the focus on George Floyd, on advancing our movement and on preventing this from ever happening again,” tweeted St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter, who is black. Erika Atson, 20, was among thousands of people who gathered outside government offices in downtown Minneapolis, where organizers had called a peaceful protest. Many protesters wore masks because of the coronavirus pandemic, but there were few attempts at social distancing. Atson, who is black, described seeing her 14- and 11-year-old brothers tackled by Minneapolis police years ago because officers mistakenly presumed the boys had guns. She said she had been at “every single protest” since Floyd’s death and worried about raising children who could be vulnerable in police encounters. “We don’t want to be here fighting against anyone. We don’t want anyone to be hurt. We don’t want to cause any damages,” she said. “We just want the police officer to be held accountable.” Hennepin County Sheriff David Hutchinson said the rally had been peaceful and there had been no arrests by late evening. After calling in the Guard, Walz urged widespread changes in the wake of Floyd’s death. “It is time to rebuild. Rebuild the city, rebuild our justice system and rebuild the relationship between law enforcement and those they’re charged to protect,” Walz said. Much of the Minneapolis violence occurred in the Longfellow neighborhood, where protesters converged on the precinct station of the police who arrested Floyd. In a strip mall across the street from the 3rd Precinct station, the windows in nearly every business had been smashed, from the large Target department store at one end to the Planet Fitness gym at the other. Only the 24-hour laundromat appeared to have escaped unscathed. “WHY US?” demanded a large expanse of red graffiti scrawled on the wall of the Target. A Wendy’s restaurant across the street was charred almost beyond recognition. Among the casualties of the overnight fires: a six-story building under construction that was to provide nearly 200 apartments of affordable housing. “We’re burning our own neighborhood,” said a distraught Deona Brown, a 24-year-old woman standing with a friend outside the precinct station, where a small group of protesters were shouting at a dozen or so stone-faced police officers in riot gear. “This is where we live, where we shop, and they destroyed it.” No officers could be seen beyond the station. “What that cop did was wrong, but I’m scared now,” Brown said. Others in the crowd saw something different in the wreckage. Protesters destroyed property “because the system is broken,” said a young man who identified himself only by his nickname, Cash, and who said he had been in the streets during the violence. He dismissed the idea that the destruction would hurt residents of the largely black neighborhood. “They’re making money off of us,” he said angrily of the owners of the destroyed stores. He laughed when asked if he had joined in the looting or violence. “I didn’t break anything.” The protests that began Wednesday night and extended into Thursday were more violent than Tuesday’s, which included skirmishes between offices and protesters but no widespread property damage. Mayor Jacob Frey appealed for calm but the city’s response to the protests was quickly questioned as things started spiraling into violence. “If the strategy was to keep residents safe — it failed,” City Council Member Jeremiah Ellison, who is black, tweeted. “Prevent property damage — it failed.” On Thursday, he urged police to leave the scene of the overnight violence, saying their presence brings people into the streets. But Eric Kowalczyk, a police captain in Baltimore during the Freddie Gray riots in 2015, generally supported the Minneapolis police strategy to avoid confrontations with protesters when possible, saying heavy-handed police responses are only met with more violence. “Nobody wants to see their city on fire, but at the same time, you don’t want to see citizens injured by the very police department they are protesting,” he said. Protests have also spread to other U.S. cities. In New York City, protesters defied New York’s coronavirus prohibition on public gatherings Thursday, clashing with police, while demonstrators blocked traffic in downtown Denver. A day earlier, demonstrators had taken to the streets in Los Angeles and Memphis. Amid the violence in Minneapolis, a man was found fatally shot Wednesday night near a pawn shop, possibly by the owner, authorities said. Fire crews responded to about 30 intentionally set blazes, and multiple fire trucks were damaged by rocks and other projectiles, the fire department said. No one was hurt by the blazes. The city on Thursday released a transcript of the 911 call that brought police to the grocery store where Floyd was arrested. The caller described someone paying with a counterfeit bill, with workers rushing outside to find the man sitting on a van. The caller described the man as “awfully drunk and he’s not in control of himself.” Asked by the 911 operator whether the man was “under the influence of something,” the caller said: “Something like that, yes. He is not acting right.” Police said Floyd matched the caller’s description of the suspect. The U.S. Attorney’s Office and the FBI in Minneapolis said Thursday they were conducting “a robust criminal investigation” into the death. President Trump has said he had asked an investigation to be expedited. The FBI is also investigating whether Floyd’s civil rights were violated. Chauvin, the officer who kneeled on Floyd’s neck, was fired Tuesday with three other officers involved in the arrest. The next day, the mayor called for Chauvin to be criminally charged. He also appealed for the activation of the National Guard. Send questions/comments to the editors. « Previous Next »",0.0

Among the casualties of the overnight fires: a six-story building under construction that was to provide nearly 200 apartments of affordable housing. “We’re burning our own neighborhood,” said a distraught Deona Brown, a 24-year-old woman standing with a friend outside the precinct station, where a small group of protesters were shouting at a dozen or so stone-faced police officers in riot gear. “This is where we live, where we shop, and they destroyed it.” No officers could be seen beyond the station. “What that cop did was wrong, but I’m scared now,” Brown said. Others in the crowd saw something different in the wreckage. Protesters destroyed property “because the system is broken,” said a young man who identified himself only by his nickname, Cash, and who said he had been in the streets during the violence. He dismissed the idea that the destruction would hurt residents of the largely black neighborhood. “They’re making money off of us,” he said angrily of the owners of the destroyed stores. He laughed when asked if he had joined in the looting or violence. “I didn’t break anything.” The protests that began Wednesday night and extended into Thursday were more violent than Tuesday’s, which included skirmishes between offices and protesters but no widespread property damage. Mayor Jacob Frey appealed for calm but the city’s response to the protests was quickly questioned as things started spiraling into violence. “If the strategy was to keep residents safe — it failed,” City Council Member Jeremiah Ellison, who is black, tweeted. “Prevent property damage — it failed.” On Thursday, he urged police to leave the scene of the overnight violence, saying their presence brings people into the streets. But Eric Kowalczyk, a police captain in Baltimore during the Freddie Gray riots in 2015, generally supported the Minneapolis police strategy to avoid confrontations with protesters when possible, saying heavy-handed police responses are only met with more violence. “Nobody wants to see their city on fire, but at the same time, you don’t want to see citizens injured by the very police department they are protesting,” he said. Protests have also spread to other U.S. cities. In New York City, protesters defied New York’s coronavirus prohibition on public gatherings Thursday, clashing with police, while demonstrators blocked traffic in downtown Denver. A day earlier, demonstrators had taken to the streets in Los Angeles and Memphis. Amid the violence in Minneapolis, a man was found fatally shot Wednesday night near a pawn shop, possibly by the owner, authorities said. Fire crews responded to about 30 intentionally set blazes, and multiple fire trucks were damaged by rocks and other projectiles, the fire department said. No one was hurt by the blazes. The city on Thursday released a transcript of the 911 call that brought police to the grocery store where Floyd was arrested. The caller described someone paying with a counterfeit bill, with workers rushing outside to find the man sitting on a van. The caller described the man as “awfully drunk and he’s not in control of himself.” Asked by the 911 operator whether the man was “under the influence of something,” the caller said: “Something like that, yes. He is not acting right.” Police said Floyd matched the caller’s description of the suspect. The U.S. Attorney’s Office and the FBI in Minneapolis said Thursday they were conducting “a robust criminal investigation” into the death. President Trump has said he had asked an investigation to be expedited. The FBI is also investigating whether Floyd’s civil rights were violated. Chauvin, the officer who kneeled on Floyd’s neck, was fired Tuesday with three other officers involved in the arrest. The next day, the mayor called for Chauvin to be criminally charged. He also appealed for the activation of the National Guard. Send questions/comments to the editors. « Previous Next »",0.0
1619343184,2020-05-28 14:16:22,"Minneapolis leaders urge calm after looting and riots, assess how to aid destroyed businesses",https://www.centralmaine.com/2020/05/28/minneapolis-leaders-urge-calm-after-looting-and-riots-assess-how-to-aid-destroyed-businesses/,en,False,,29592,onlinesentinel.com,http://www.onlinesentinel.com#spider,"MINNEAPOLIS — Cheering protesters broke into a Minneapolis police precinct station on Thursday after the department abandoned it, setting it ablaze and igniting fireworks as three days of violent protests spread to cities across the U.S over the death of George Floyd, a handcuffed black man. A police spokesman confirmed late Thursday that staff had evacuated the 3rd precinct station, the focus of many of the protests, “in the interest of the safety of our personnel” shortly after 10 p.m. Livestream video showed the protesters entering the building, where fire alarms blared and sprinklers ran as blazes were set. Protesters could be seen setting fire to a Minneapolis Police Department jacket and cheering. Protests first erupted Tuesday, a day after Floyd’s death in a confrontation with police captured on widely seen citizen video. On the video, Floyd can be seen pleading that he can’t breathe as Officer Derek Chauvin, who is white, kneels on his neck. As minutes pass, Floyd slowly stops talking and moving. The 3rd Precinct covers the portion of south Minneapolis where Floyd died. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz earlier Thursday activated the National Guard at the Minneapolis mayor’s request, but it wasn’t immediately clear when and where the Guard was being deployed, and none could be seen during protests in Minneapolis or St. Paul. The Guard tweeted minutes after the precinct burned that it had activated more than 500 soldiers across the metro area. . Earlier Thursday, dozens of businesses across the Twin Cities boarded up their windows and doors in an effort to prevent looting, with Minneapolis-based Target announcing it was temporarily closing two dozen area stores. Minneapolis shut down nearly its entire light-rail system and all bus service through Sunday out of safety concerns. In St. Paul, clouds of smoke hung in the air as police armed with batons and wearing gas masks and body armor kept a watchful eye on protesters along one of the city’s main commercial corridors, where firefighters also sprayed water onto a series of small fires. At one point, officers stood in line in front of a Target, trying to keep out looters, who were also smashing windows of other businesses. Hundreds of demonstrators returned Thursday to the Minneapolis neighborhood at the center of the violence, where the nighttime scene veered between an angry protest and a street party. At one point, a band playing in a parking lot across from the 3rd Precinct broke into a punk version of Bob Marley’s “Redemption Song.” Nearby, demonstrators carried clothing mannequins from a looted Target and threw them onto a burning car. Later, a building fire erupted nearby. But elsewhere in Minneapolis, thousands of peaceful demonstrators marched through the streets calling for justice. Floyd’s death has deeply shaken Minneapolis and sparked protests in cities across the U.S. Local leaders have repeatedly urged demonstrators to avoid violence. “Please stay home. Please do not come here to protest. Please keep the focus on George Floyd, on advancing our movement and on preventing this from ever happening again,” tweeted St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter, who is black. Erika Atson, 20, was among thousands of people who gathered outside government offices in downtown Minneapolis, where organizers had called a peaceful protest. Many protesters wore masks because of the coronavirus pandemic, but there were few attempts at social distancing. Atson, who is black, described seeing her 14- and 11-year-old brothers tackled by Minneapolis police years ago because officers mistakenly presumed the boys had guns. She said she had been at “every single protest” since Floyd’s death and worried about raising children who could be vulnerable in police encounters. “We don’t want to be here fighting against anyone. We don’t want anyone to be hurt. We don’t want to cause any damages,” she said. “We just want the police officer to be held accountable.” Hennepin County Sheriff David Hutchinson said the rally had been peaceful and there had been no arrests by late evening. After calling in the Guard, Walz urged widespread changes in the wake of Floyd’s death. “It is time to rebuild. Rebuild the city, rebuild our justice system and rebuild the relationship between law enforcement and those they’re charged to protect,” Walz said. Much of the Minneapolis violence occurred in the Longfellow neighborhood, where protesters converged on the precinct station of the police who arrested Floyd. In a strip mall across the street from the 3rd Precinct station, the windows in nearly every business had been smashed, from the large Target department store at one end to the Planet Fitness gym at the other. Only the 24-hour laundromat appeared to have escaped unscathed. “WHY US?” demanded a large expanse of red graffiti scrawled on the wall of the Target. A Wendy’s restaurant across the street was charred almost beyond recognition.

You can support our critical reporting on the coronavirus by purchasing a digital subscription or donating directly to the newsroom. About a dozen protesters gathered in Augusta on Thursday to protest Gov. Janet Mills’ decision to delay the reopening of restaurants in Cumberland, York and Androscoggin counties beyond June 1 due to increased hospitalizations from the new coronavirus. Capitol Police Chief Russell J. Gauvin said that the protest was peaceful, the fifth such event since Mills declared a state of emergency with the discovery of Maine’s first case of COVID-19 infection in March. A Twitter post from the scene indicated that the protesters claimed they had been issued a $50 summons for having more than 10 people gathered, but Gauvin said that no law enforcement action was taken. An investigation into the protest is continuing, he said. Mike Hartford | CBS13 Mike Hartford | CBS13 Mills discussed on Wednesday her decision to delay the restaurant reopenings’ beyond June 1. She said that the three counties have the highest numbers of coronavirus cases. They can offer outside dining service beginning June 1, but not dine-in eating. She did not disclose a new reopening date. [Our COVID-19 tracker contains the most recent information on Maine cases by county] She based her decision on data from the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention, including hospitalizations and rising case counts related to the virus. As of Wednesday, 59 Mainers were hospitalized, with 25 in intensive care, according to the CDC. That was up from 41 last Thursday with the uptick tied to long-term care facilities in southern Maine. Restaurants in Penobscot County may reopen inside and outside on June 1 using safety precautions including physical distancing and enhanced sanitation practices, Mills said. Retail stores in all four counties can reopen indoor shopping. Mills also said the rules on gatherings will increase from 10 people permitted per gathering to 50 people on June 1.

The statement said there were “some arrests,” but police didn't provide a number.“No officers discharged their service weapons,” police spokesman Sgt. Lamont Washington wrote in an email to The Associated Press. Washington said that all seven were civilians.The protests stretched for more than six hours, ending in the early hours of Friday as rain poured down.“Understandably, emotions are high,” Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer tweeted just before midnight, sharing a Facebook post asking for peace that he said was written on behalf of Taylor's mother. “As Breonna's mother says let's be peaceful as we work toward truth and justice.”Taylor, a 26-year-old emergency medical tech, was shot eight times on March 13 after Louisville narcotics detectives knocked down the front door. No drugs were found in the home.Attention on Taylor's death has intensified after her family sued the police department earlier this month. The case has attracted national headlines alongside the shooting of Ahmaud Arbery in a Georgia neighborhood in February.Thursday's demonstration came as protesters across the country — from Los Angeles to Memphis, Tennessee, to New York to Minneapolis itself — have demonstrated against the death of a black man, George Floyd, in Minneapolis police custody.Around 12:20 a.m., Fischer tweeted a video that he said was a message from Taylor's family.“Louisville, thank you so much for saying Breonna's name tonight. We are not going to stop until we get justice,” a woman says in the video. “But we should stop tonight before people get hurt. Please go home, be safe and be ready to keep fighting.”Meanwhile, live video from downtown Louisville around 12:30 a.m. showed some protesters behind makeshift wooden barricades, which appeared to be made out of picnic tables spray-painted with the words “You can’t kill us all.” Police in body armor and face shields held batons and lined up around Louisville City Hall. They appeared to fire rubber bullets and deploy tear gas canisters, fogging the air and inducing coughs among the remaining members of the crowd.Chants from protesters early Friday included “No justice, no peace” and “Whose streets? Our streets.”",0.0
1619912732,2020-05-29 06:23:29,Twitter flags Trump tweet calling Minneapolis protesters ‘thugs’,https://www.sunjournal.com/2020/05/29/twitter-flags-trump-tweet-calling-minneapolis-protesters-thugs/,en,False,,68001,sunjournal.com,http://www.sunjournal.com/#spider,"WASHINGTON — President Trump spent Friday walking back his post-midnight “thugs” tweet about Minneapolis protesters that added to outrage over the police killing of a black man. Trump’s later repeated condemnation of the killing and outreach to the man’s family was a marked change in tone from his earlier comments that also invoked a civil-rights-era phrase fraught with racist overtones. “When the looting starts, the shooting starts,” Trump had written in a tweet that was quickly flagged by Twitter as violating rules against “glorifying violence.” Trump later said his comments had been misconstrued. “Frankly it means when there’s looting, people get shot and they die,” he said. Trump’s whiplash comments came after protesters torched a Minneapolis police station on Thursday night, capping three days of searing demonstrations over the death of George Floyd, who was captured on video pleading for air as a white police officer knelt on his neck for over eight minutes. And they underscored Trump’s complicated relationship with race as he tries to maintain a law-and-order mantle while looking to appeal to black voters during an election year. They also highlighted his refusal to avoid controversy or cede the spotlight even as the battered nation tries to make sense of another killing and reels over the mounting COVID-19 death toll. Trump, in his tweets, borrowed a phrase once used by former Miami Police Chief Walter Headley in a 1967 speech outlining his department’s efforts to “combat young hoodlums who have taken advantage of the civil rights campaign.” In the speech, Headley said his department had been successful “because I’ve let the word filter down that when the looting starts, the shooting starts.” “We don’t mind being accused of police brutality,” he said in the same speech, according to news reports from the time. Trump, after hours of backlash, said Friday evening that he was unaware of the origins of the phrase. “But I’ve heard it for a long time, as most people have. And frankly it means when there’s looting, people get shot and they die,” he said. Trump also revealed that he had been in touch with Floyd’s family as he continued to denounce the circumstances of the man’s killing, which he called “a terrible insult to police and to policemen.” “I just expressed my sorrow,” Trump told reporters. “He was in tremendous pain, obviously, and couldn’t breathe. And it was very obvious to anybody that watched it.” Still, Trump called on protesters to keep their demonstrations peaceful. “The family of George is entitled to justice, and the people of Minnesota are entitled to live in safety,” he said. “Law and order will prevail.” Criticism of the Trump’s tweet had been swift, with his presumptive Democratic presidential rival Joe Biden saying it was “no time for incendiary tweets, no time to incite violence.” “It’s not helpful,” said Minnesota’s Democratic Gov. Tim Walz. “Anything we do to add fuel to that fire is really, really challenging.” Rep. Emmanuel Cleaver, D-Mo., said that, as the country passed the grim milestone of more than 100,000 COVID-19 deaths, Trump had missed a chance to help the public cope with “two viruses: One is the coronavirus and the other is the virus of racial animus.” Trump has been accused of stoking racial tensions and exploiting divisions for personal gain since long before he ran for president, beginning with the full-page ads he ran in 1989 calling for the death penalty for the Central Park Five, five young men of color who were wrongly convicted of assaulting a white jogger. Trump — who rarely holds his tongue — has been silent in the face of a long list of high-profile killings by police of black men, including Eric Garner, who was placed in a chokehold and whose dying words, “I can’t breathe,” became a rallying cry for the Black Lives Matter movement. (Trump has instead invoked those words on several occasions to mock political rivals, even bringing his hands to his neck for dramatic effect.) He spent years railing against NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick and other players for kneeling during the National Anthem to protest racial injustice and police brutality. And in one speech he appeared to advocate rougher treatment of people in custody, speaking dismissively of the police practice of shielding the heads of handcuffed suspects as they are being placed in patrol cars. At the same time, Trump and his campaign have tried to make inroads with black Americans, particularly after Biden suggested last week that black voters who support Trump “ain’t black.” A bedrock of the Democratic base, black Americans are unlikely to embrace Trump en masse, but his campaign believes even a marginal shift could make a difference — and send a message to white voters uneasy about the president’s charged rhetoric. Meanwhile, the unrest complicates the Trump campaign’s plans for Minnesota, one of the key swing states he hopes to win in November. Twitter’s decision to flag Trump’s tweet — the second time it has acted this week — came a day after he signed an executive order challenging the social media giant’s protections against lawsuits as he accuses it of stifling conservative voices. The warning label prevented the tweet from being shared or liked, though it could still be viewed by users. The White House, trying to skirt the blockage, reposted the message on its own official Twitter account Friday morning. Twitter quickly flagged that tweet, too, accusing the White House of promoting violence. Supporters of the president balked at the move. Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale accused the media, Biden and other Democrats of “purposefully misrepresenting what the President had said, and showing once again that they are incapable of resisting their base impulse of dividing Americans, solely for the purpose of political gain, ratings, and cable news profit.” « Previous Next »",0.0

1619930482,2020-05-29 06:23:29,Twitter flags Trump tweet calling Minneapolis protesters ‘thugs’,https://www.centralmaine.com/2020/05/29/twitter-flags-trump-tweet-calling-minneapolis-protesters-thugs/,en,False,,29592,onlinesentinel.com,http://www.onlinesentinel.com#spider,"WASHINGTON — President Trump spent Friday walking back his post-midnight “thugs” tweet about Minneapolis protesters that added to outrage over the police killing of a black man. Trump’s later repeated condemnation of the killing and outreach to the man’s family was a marked change in tone from his earlier comments that also invoked a civil-rights-era phrase fraught with racist overtones. “When the looting starts, the shooting starts,” Trump had written in a tweet that was quickly flagged by Twitter as violating rules against “glorifying violence.” Trump later said his comments had been misconstrued. “Frankly it means when there’s looting, people get shot and they die,” he said. Trump’s whiplash comments came after protesters torched a Minneapolis police station on Thursday night, capping three days of searing demonstrations over the death of George Floyd, who was captured on video pleading for air as a white police officer knelt on his neck for over eight minutes. And they underscored Trump’s complicated relationship with race as he tries to maintain a law-and-order mantle while looking to appeal to black voters during an election year. They also highlighted his refusal to avoid controversy or cede the spotlight even as the battered nation tries to make sense of another killing and reels over the mounting COVID-19 death toll. Trump, in his tweets, borrowed a phrase once used by former Miami Police Chief Walter Headley in a 1967 speech outlining his department’s efforts to “combat young hoodlums who have taken advantage of the civil rights campaign.” In the speech, Headley said his department had been successful “because I’ve let the word filter down that when the looting starts, the shooting starts.” “We don’t mind being accused of police brutality,” he said in the same speech, according to news reports from the time. Trump, after hours of backlash, said Friday evening that he was unaware of the origins of the phrase. “But I’ve heard it for a long time, as most people have. And frankly it means when there’s looting, people get shot and they die,” he said. Trump also revealed that he had been in touch with Floyd’s family as he continued to denounce the circumstances of the man’s killing, which he called “a terrible insult to police and to policemen.” “I just expressed my sorrow,” Trump told reporters. “He was in tremendous pain, obviously, and couldn’t breathe. And it was very obvious to anybody that watched it.” Still, Trump called on protesters to keep their demonstrations peaceful. “The family of George is entitled to justice, and the people of Minnesota are entitled to live in safety,” he said. “Law and order will prevail.” Criticism of the Trump’s tweet had been swift, with his presumptive Democratic presidential rival Joe Biden saying it was “no time for incendiary tweets, no time to incite violence.” “It’s not helpful,” said Minnesota’s Democratic Gov. Tim Walz. “Anything we do to add fuel to that fire is really, really challenging.” Rep. Emmanuel Cleaver, D-Mo., said that, as the country passed the grim milestone of more than 100,000 COVID-19 deaths, Trump had missed a chance to help the public cope with “two viruses: One is the coronavirus and the other is the virus of racial animus.” Trump has been accused of stoking racial tensions and exploiting divisions for personal gain since long before he ran for president, beginning with the full-page ads he ran in 1989 calling for the death penalty for the Central Park Five, five young men of color who were wrongly convicted of assaulting a white jogger. Trump — who rarely holds his tongue — has been silent in the face of a long list of high-profile killings by police of black men, including Eric Garner, who was placed in a chokehold and whose dying words, “I can’t breathe,” became a rallying cry for the Black Lives Matter movement. (Trump has instead invoked those words on several occasions to mock political rivals, even bringing his hands to his neck for dramatic effect.) He spent years railing against NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick and other players for kneeling during the National Anthem to protest racial injustice and police brutality. And in one speech he appeared to advocate rougher treatment of people in custody, speaking dismissively of the police practice of shielding the heads of handcuffed suspects as they are being placed in patrol cars.

That was quite a scene of what you've just endured for the past hour. Can you tell us what happened? Well, we saw a lot of it play out on TV there. There seemed to be a little bit of confusion as to what what was supposed to or what was allowed to happen. Now, well, as we're reporting, we had been in verbal contact. At least it seemed, with some of the police officers saying, All right, where can we be? We have heard we played some of it as they were giving out commands for people to clear the area. And we saw that as protesters completely cleared out. And that, of course, came after there was an hour and 1/2. Or at least where we're standing, where there was no sort of police presence. So as people came down, we saw them walking down the block, and whether repress or not, we wanted to make sure we were out of the way. So you so we basically stepped onto the corner is where we were. And I think the moment before the arrest actually happened was we saw at least 11 protester or Allison, who was not media sort of run past us. And that person was cornered by State Patrol was the main unit that seemed to be there. And after that person was apprehended, they then turned toward us now, and that was the first moment I could say that police had gotten behind us. So in a sense, we were sort of surrounded by state patrolman, and it seemed like Minneapolis police officers as well. But again, it was that moment where all of a sudden someone runs past and there are already on edge based on the absolute destruction that's all around them. And that arrests happened just right in front of the Minneapolis Third Precinct. That, of course, went up in flames last night. Omar, I'm not sure you know this, but our cameras were not only rolling the whole time you were taken into custody, but the cameras continue to roll. Frankly, for the entire ride to the precinct, we could see the picture for the whole time. First of all, let me also say, Omar, what an amazing job you did throughout that your composure and your ability to keep your cool is a testament to your professionalism. Um, which we already knew about by how great of a job you're doing covering the story on the streets there. You and your team did a terrific job. Now what we did not hear, even though we saw the transportation, is from the moment you were lead away until the moment you were just released. So can you please tell us what took place while you were in custody? Well, everyone to their credit, was pretty cordial after that happened. So it seemed I was actually talking to the officer that was leading me away. I was like, And then we're gonna be out here for the next few days. What is the guidance of where we should be? If you don't want us that close, where should we? Because we're under the impression that that was OK. And he said, Look, I don't know, man. I'm just following orders, so I don't know who is potentially giving that order in that particular moment. But as far as the people that were leading me away, they there was no animosity there. They weren't they weren't violent with me. We're having conversation about just how crazy this week has been for every single part of the city. And like I mentioned, a lot of these people are on edge. And as we were walking by, we saw a person on the edge of sort of the perimeter that they had formed. And this wasn't a protester. This was just a a random it seemed citizen, who was saying, Hey, I need to get back into my place over there. And where were you when this neighborhood? Completely about the short. I mean, we saw where they were. They were in the middle of what became a focal point of anger, passion, violence, even at times and there they were forced to retreat. And then this morning, literally within a matter of minutes, we saw all of them swarm back in clearing out these protesters from the city level. That's we saw the fire department and Police Department come in. And then the State Patrol was advancing as we're seeing up that street toward our location. Now, where we were standing basically to my right, was where all the protesters were outside or in front of the the building that was on fire and into our left was where they were advancing. So we were basically just going to try and step back and let them continue to advance down the street. But again, you saw what unfolded there. But as far as what happened in between again, they were They were pretty cordial. Once we're in the trucks as well. They were were downtown. Obviously, this is the Hennepin County Public Safety Building here. They're all pretty pretty good with us. Onda conversation. Well, that's a relief, Omar, because you could not have been more professional. You were doing your job by the book. You presented your credentials. You told them that you were a journalist. You told them that you were within and you told them you were. They were. You were live on the air. I mean, you did them the courtesy of explaining that we were live on the air at that moment. And I'm just wondering, after you and your crew were arrested, at what point did they? I mean, did they ever say sorry, that was a mistake. Or when they released you, Was there an explanation of that? That had all been a big misunderstanding or mistake and you're allowed to report there. That conversation may have happened above some of the people that were with for us. It was literally a situation off. Tell me who you are. Me as far as identification purposes than they left. And they came back and said, You're with CNN, Correct? Yes. And then we explained that to other team members that were with me on three, including the security that we that we had hired for this. And then they left, came back and then let us out of the van, were inside the van, handcuffed the whole time. And then we were sat down, waited for a little bit more, and then from there, that was when they eventually came back with our with our belongings that they confiscated. Over the course of this, they had they unclipped our handcuffs. And then that is when we were let out. And again, it's answer your question. There was no sort of sorry. This is a big misunderstanding, blah, blah, blah, because it seems that conversation may have happened. But it didn't happen with us in particular, but also is the difference of jurisdiction. Just just one more question because it was It was a nerve racking moment for all of us watching. You know, Bakari Sellers just described watching it and saying that it was really emotional and heart pumping for him because he was scared for you and other people watching. Given the backdrop of everything that's happening in Minneapolis, he was scared for you at this moment when you were being taken into custody. You know, I should also let you know that Josh Campbell, who was reporting a block or two away from you, was not taken into custody. He was treated quite politely. Were you scared when this was happening? And do you have any idea why you were arrested and not Josh Kim? Well, there was a moment, I would say, minutes after it happened, where things started to sink in a little bit. I think I don't have to tell you Alison or John that sometimes when you're in this job in these scenarios, there's a lot of adrenaline pumping. You're trying to focus and balance so many different factors. In a case like this, I'm tryingto balance what the actual story is, how the story line is advancing while also trying to be aware of our surroundings, which at times can get dangerous. So there's that mentality, and then the arrest happened. I was still trying to communicate with you all as this was going on, because I was just confused as you. We have been showing our credentials throughout this entire week, and especially in the moments leading up to that. So I couldn't really understand what was going on. But as we were walking away and you're sort of taking in the entire neighborhood that had been completely decimated again from the passion of the protesters and unfortunately, some of the rioting and looting that we had seen. It did cross my mind that what is really happening here, and the one thing that gave me a little bit of comfort was that it happened on live TV. There has been this When you talk within the community about, let's just say what's happened with George Floyd. There's always a discussion that what's happening isn't new. It's being filmed, and that speaks to the power of having something happen on camera because you can have people speak up for you without you saying anything. And that gave me a little bit of comfort knowing that you guys saw what was happening. I was living what was happening, and the country was seeing what was happening unfold in real time, right before their eyes. You don't have to doubt my story. It's not filtered in any sort of way. You saw it for your own eyes, and that gave me a little bit of comfort, but it definitely was nerve racking a certain point.

1620028657,2020-05-29 08:32:22,7 shot at Louisville protest over fatal police shooting,https://www.pressherald.com/2020/05/29/7-shot-at-louisville-protest-over-fatal-police-shooting/,en,False,,366984,pressherald.com,http://pressherald.com/,"LOUISVILLE, Ky. — At least seven people were shot in Louisville as hundreds of protesters converged on City Hall demanding justice for Breonna Taylor, a black woman who was fatally shot in March by police who broke down her door. Louisville Metro Police said early Friday that at least one person was in critical condition. “No officers discharged their service weapons,” and all seven shot were civilians, police spokesman Sgt. Lamont Washington wrote in an email to The Associated Press. “I feel the community’s frustration, the anger, the fear, but tonight’s violence and destruction is not the way to solve it,” Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer said in a video posted to Twitter. He said two of the wounded underwent surgery and five were in good condition. Thursday night’s demonstration came as protesters across the country, in cities including Los Angeles, Denver, New York and Memphis, turned out in alliance with demonstrators in Minneapolis, where George Floyd became the latest black man to die in police custody. It also came hours after the release of a 911 call Taylor’s boyfriend made on March 13, moments after the 26-year-old emergency medical technician was shot eight times by narcotics detectives who knocked down her front door. No drugs were found in the home. Around 500 to 600 demonstrators marched through the Kentucky city’s downtown streets, the Courier Journal reported. The protests continued for more than six hours, ending in the early hours of Friday as rain poured down. At one point, protesters took turns hoisting the stone hand of King Louis XVI after it was broken off his statue outside City Hall. Shots were later heard, prompting some of the protesters to scramble for safety. “Understandably, emotions are high,” Fischer tweeted just before midnight, sharing a Facebook post that appealed for people to remain non-violent as they demand justice and accountability. “As Breonna’s mother says let’s be peaceful as we work toward truth and justice,” the mayor wrote. Attention on Taylor’s death has intensified after her family sued the police department this month. The case has attracted national headlines alongside the shooting of Ahmaud Arbery in a Georgia neighborhood in February. Around 12:20 a.m., Fischer tweeted a video that he said was a message from Taylor’s family. “Louisville, thank you so much for saying Breonna’s name tonight. We are not going to stop until we get justice,” a woman says in the video. “But we should stop tonight before people get hurt. Please go home, be safe and be ready to keep fighting.” Meanwhile, live video from downtown Louisville around 12:30 a.m. showed some protesters behind makeshift wooden barricades, which appeared to be made out of picnic tables spray-painted with the words “You can’t kill us all.” A small fire inside a trash can was visible in the middle of the street. Police in body armor and face shields held batons and lined up downtown. They appeared to fire rubber bullets and deploy tear gas canisters, fogging the air and inducing coughs among the remaining members of the crowd. Protesters recorded officers with their cellphones. Kentuckians are still under social distancing mandates driven by the coronavirus pandemic. Many protesters wore masks. Chants early Friday included “No justice, no peace” and “Whose streets?

1620144419,2020-05-29 10:35:52,Human Rights Watch calls for Tulsa Race Massacre reparations a century after violence,https://www.pressherald.com/2020/05/29/human-rights-watch-calls-for-tulsa-race-massacre-reparations-a-century-after-violence/,en,False,,366984,pressherald.com,http://pressherald.com/,"On the eve of the 99th anniversary of the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre, Human Rights Watch released a report Friday demanding reparations for survivors and descendants of the violence, which left hundreds of black people dead and blocks smoldering. “No one has ever been held responsible for these crimes, the impacts of which black Tulsans still feel today,” says the report, entitled “The Case for Reparations in Tulsa, Oklahoma: A Human Rights Argument.” “Efforts to secure justice in the courts have failed due to the statute of limitations. Ongoing racial segregation, discriminatory policies, and structural racism have left black Tulsans, particularly those living in North Tulsa, with a lower quality of life and fewer opportunities.” Human Rights Watch argued that the beyond the physical destruction, the state and city government created polices of structural racism that kept black people in Tulsa from prospering. The lingering economic impact of the massacre can be seen today in the high poverty rates and lower life expectancies in North Tulsa. “Generations of black Tulsans, especially massacre survivors and their descendants, have endured cumulative economic and moral losses and an inescapable cycle of pain,” said Dreisen Heath, the U.S. program advocacy officer at Human Rights Watch and author of the report. “Reparations are the right thing to do, and the city of Tulsa and state of Oklahoma have the power to repair a century of harm.” A spokesperson for Tulsa’s Mayor G.T. Bynum, R, said the mayor had not seen the report and could not comment. In January, Bynum told The Post he believed the city should address the issue of reparations after the city completes its investigation into mass graves. It was preparing to dig when the coronavirus pandemic put the search for mass graves on hold. “There is a strong demand to start talking about reparations,” Bynum said. “A lot of people when they talk about reparations, they talk about cash payments to descendants. There is a challenge to track descendants, who are scattered all over the world.” The massacre-one of the worst incidents of racial violence in U.S. history-began on May 31, 1921, when a white mob descended on Greenwood, an African American community so prosperous it was called “Black Wall Street.” Over the next 48 hours, historians believe as many as 300 black people were killed, and more 10,000 were left homeless, after businesses and homes were burned to the ground. There were reports of airplanes flying above Greenwood and dropping kerosene bombs. Witnesses recounted seeing white mobs looting homes of black people and setting the houses on fire. “They tried to kill all the black folks they could see,” a survivor, George Monroe, recalled. Some said bodies were thrown into the Arkansas River or buried in mass graves. On June 1, 1921, martial law was declared. Troops rounded up black survivors and detained them in camps in throughout the city. “Government officials committed no public money to help Greenwood rebuild,” Human Rights Watch reported. “Rather, they impeded rebuilding, even rejecting offers of medical and reconstruction assistance from within and outside Tulsa.” In 2001, the Tulsa Race Riot Commission, which was charged by the state with finding out what happened during the massacre, recommended reparations for massacre survivors and descendants, but city officials ignored the commission’s recommendations. The city also did not act on the commission’s recommendation to excavate for possible mass graves. The case seemed closed until 2018, when Bynum announced the city would reopen an investigation into the possibility of mass graves. In October, scientists and forensic anthropologists armed with ground-penetrating radar began scanning the grounds of Tulsa’s Oaklawn Cemetery. In December, a team of forensic anthropologists and archaeologists, led by the Oklahoma Archaeological Survey at the University of Oklahoma, announced they found “possible common graves” at two sites in Tulsa. The city was scheduled to begin digging at Oaklawn Cemetery in April, but the excavation was postponed by the covid-19 pandemic. Officials said they will reschedule the dig when it is safe for scientists to travel. On Sunday, the 99th anniversary of the massacre, activists, community and civil rights leaders are set to begin a series of virtual forums titled “Their Blood Cries Out,” in which panelists will talk about reparations and racial justice. Kristi Williams, a community activist in Tulsa, said she believes reparations are past due. “We lost homes, businesses and lives,” Williams said. “We need to be compensated because it is time for us to build from what our ancestors left us. And their blood has been crying out for a long time.” The Rev. Robert Turner, pastor of the historic Vernon AME Church where black people hid during the massacre, said, “Reparations should look like justice. Nothing has been done as far as slavery from 1619 and nothing has been done in regards to worst race massacre in American history. Meanwhile, we have compensated other parts of this state for mass terror-the Oklahoma City bombing. Yet Greenwood, the first site of an aerial bombing terrorism in this country, has not received a dime.” In 2005, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed without comment a lawsuit against Tulsa, its police department and the State of Oklahoma, demanding reparations. Survivors-many of them in their 90s- stood on the steps of the Supreme Court utterly crestfallen, having hoped for justice before they died. Otis G. Clark, who was 18 when the mob burned down his home during the massacre, explained his loss. “Family and friends missing. Jobs gone,” Clark said in an interview before he died in 2012. “The city took my grandmother’s land and didn’t give us nothing in return. We suffered. But Tulsa has given us nothing . . . even to this day – nothing.” Send questions/comments to the editors. « Previous Next » filed under:",0.0
1620147935,2020-05-29 10:24:03,Minneapolis Seethes Over George Floyd's Death As Trump Calls Protesters 'THUGS',https://www.mainepublic.org/post/minneapolis-seethes-over-george-floyds-death-trump-calls-protesters-thugs,en,False,,79928,mpbn.net,http://www.mpbn.net/#spider,"Minneapolis is burning. For a third straight night, the Midwestern city saw clashes between police and protesters after the death of George Floyd, a black man whose arresting officer was recorded kneeling on his neck for minutes on end. The four officers involved have been fired and the incident is under federal investigation, but demonstrators are not satisfied. Some of them stormed the 3rd Police Precinct, setting fire to that building and others in the neighborhood. President Trump, who called Floyd's death ""very sad and tragic"" earlier this week, said early Friday that he had told Minnesota's governor that ""the Military is with him all the way."" He also described the source of the unrest as ""THUGS"" — a word widely criticized for bearing racial overtones. ""Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts,"" he continued, in a tweet flagged by Twitter for violating its policy against glorifying violence. The president's comments came after a night of chaos in the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul, where several fires raged and some businesses were sacked, according to Minnesota Public Radio. Protesters also overran the 3rd Precinct after police withdrew in an attempt to mitigate tensions. ""Brick and mortar is not as important as life,"" Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said, noting that though the building was emptied, patrols would continue in the neighborhood. ""We are doing absolutely everything that we can to keep the peace."" Minneapolis has seethed since the release of the video depicting Floyd's arrest by a white police officer. The officer plants a knee on his neck for at least seven minutes as Floyd cries for help and eventually falls silent and as bystanders shout that he's dying. The officer did not remove his knee until paramedics showed up to move Floyd's unresponsive body into an ambulance. He was reported dead later that night. Since then, Minneapolis has seen a series of escalating protests over his death, while anger has been evident in other cities, as well. Protesters have turned out to express their outrage as far as Los Angeles and New York City. Meanwhile in Louisville, Ky., demonstrators gathered Thursday to protest death of Breonna Taylor, a black woman shot by police in her home in March. As one protester in Minneapolis told NPR, the anger over Floyd's death is about more than just one man — it's about how police treat black people across the U.S. ""This is how our people react, you know? When we've been done wrong for so long,"" he said. ""So, me, I'm just praying and hoping everybody makes it home safe."" On Friday morning, state police arrested a CNN crew while they were reporting about the unrest on live television. ""A black reporter from CNN was arrested while legally covering the protests in Minneapolis,"" the network pointedly noted. ""A white reporter also on the ground was not."" The crew consisting of correspondent Omar Jimenez, producer Bill Kirkos and photojournalist Leonel Mendez was released about an hour later. CNN Worldwide President Jeff Zucker said that Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz personally apologized to him for the incident. The swift backtrack did little to soften the shock of the spectacle, though. ""With all the perversions of American democracy that we have witnessed, few rival the dystopian spectacle of a U.S. journalist calmly reporting the news and repeatedly offering to reposition his crew at the police's request, only to be arrested, cuffed and hauled away alongside his crew,"" said Suzanne Nossel, CEO of PEN America, advocacy group that fights for press freedom. She added: ""For us at PEN America, where we routinely document the arrest and imprisonment of writers and journalists worldwide, the action was eerily familiar, but something we expect to see in authoritarian states: Turkey, Hong Kong, Egypt. To see it in the United States of America is appalling."" NPR's Adrian Florido contributed to this report. ",0.0

The FBI has opened an investigation into the shooting death.Hundreds flocked downtown Thursday night, and on Friday, it happened again — people demanding justice in the death of Taylor, as well as two minority men recently killed.Details of the case remained quiet for several weeks, but gained national attention after video of the Ahmaud Arbery shooting death in Georgia was made public. Activists across the country began speaking out about the deaths of unarmed black citizens at the hands of police and/or racist white people.In March, Taylor was shot at least eight times when three officers forcibly entered her apartment to serve a search warrant in a narcotics investigation. The department said the men announced themselves and returned gunfire when Taylor's boyfriend fired at them.But in a wrongful death lawsuit, Taylor's mother says the officers didn't knock at all and should've called off their search because the suspect they sought had already been arrested.Officers didn't find drugs in her apartment when they entered, Taylor's mother said in the lawsuit.In the weeks leading up to Thursday’s violent protest, Taylor’s family called for the LMPD officers involved in the case to be relieved of their duties and charged. Activists held a candlelight vigil, a parade and a wreath-laying ceremony to bring attention to the case. The events were all held peacefully, and Taylor's mother said she would like it to remain that way. Police presence intensified around 9:45 p.m. Friday, as officers in riot gear stood shoulder-to-shoulder moving people down a key street near City Hall, the Courier Journal reported.A police officer was seen on camera during a WAVE-TV broadcast firing what appeared to be pepper bullets directly at the camera crew.“I'm getting shot! I'm getting shot!” WAVE-TV reporter Kaitlin Rust is heard yelling off-camera. She told the indignant anchors int he studio that the crew was behind the line, but police wanted them to move further away.Seven people were shot during Thursday’s rally. Two people wounded in the gunfire underwent surgery, while five were in good condition, Mayor Greg Fischer said. CNN contributed to this report.",0.0
1620253281,2020-05-29 12:36:40,Portland police chief speaks out about Minneapolis police killing,https://www.pressherald.com/2020/05/29/portland-police-chief-speaks-out-about-minneapolis-police-killing/,en,False,,366984,pressherald.com,http://pressherald.com/,"Hundreds of people marched through Portland on Friday to protest police violence against people of color, in one of many demonstrations around the nation following the death of a black man who was detained by police in Minneapolis on Monday. George Floyd, 46, died after Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin was caught on camera kneeling on Floyd’s neck as he begged for breath before he lost consciousness. When paramedics arrived, he had no pulse and was unresponsive. Chauvin was arrested and charged with murder Friday, but not before outraged residents of Minneapolis and neighboring St. Paul demonstrated through the night, plunging the cities into unrest and chaos. The protests have spread across the nation, with groups taking to the streets from New York to California and Colorado to Florida to Atlanta. Some of the demonstrations have been peaceful, but others have led to vandalism and confrontations with police. In Portland, two groups marched peacefully through the city with dozens of police in tow blocking traffic and clearing a path for the demonstrators. The first group assembled after 3 p.m. before City Hall, marched to the Portland police station on Middle Street, and then to Monument Square before dispersing without incident around 5 p.m. Simultaneously, another group of demonstrators blocked Franklin Street near Whole Foods for about an hour before moving to the intersection of Congress Street and High Street, shutting down what is typically one of the city’s busiest intersections. Demonstrators dispersed by about 8 p.m., and there were no signs of violence or arrests. In 2016, Black Lives Matter demonstrators marched through Portland after two black men were shot and killed by police in Louisiana and Minnesota. That protest generated more than a dozen arrests, but no one was arrested during the demonstrations on Friday, and police cleared traffic and stood by as demonstrators hurled insults at them and chanted profanities. One of the demonstrators who attended the Monument Square rally, Raymond Diamond, 24, carried a white sign painted in flowing black letters that asked, “could it have been me?” Diamond said he grew up in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, where a history of slavery, racism and oppression began before the nation’s independence and continues in subtler forms today. Although Diamond said he senses less racial tension overall in Maine, he fears he could one day be the victim of police violence simply for being black. His fear of police began when he was about 14 or 15, when Diamond watched from the passenger seat as a police officer pulled over his mother in their own neighborhood, eventually making the traffic stop in their own driveway, he said. Someone must have thought they didn’t belong there, Diamond recalled. He still remembers his mother’s anger, and her warning to him afterward. “She told me to be careful and to protect myself and to do what I had to do to come home, so she isn’t one of those mothers crying on the news,” he said. “With a history like what we have, I’m not surprised this is where we are. The police are a reflection of the state. That’s not something that we can get around.” Ahead of the local demonstrations in Portland, the Portland police chief and leaders of two labor unions representing officers released a letter to the community to say they were disturbed by Floyd’s death and the way his arrest was handled. But the local police leaders – who collectively have several decades of policing experience – did not say in the written statement released Friday whether they believe the officer should face criminal prosecution. Some police leaders around the country condemned the death as nothing short of murder, and by midday Friday, Chauvin was charged by a local prosecutor and taken into custody. He faces one count of third-degree murder and one count of manslaughter. Floyd was initially detained Monday by Minneapolis police because he matched the description of someone who tried to pay with a counterfeit bill at a convenience store. A bystander’s disturbing video shows Chauvin, who is white, kneeling on Floyd’s neck, even as Floyd begs for air and slowly stops talking and moving. The statement on Friday from Portland’s chief of police, Frank Clark, was co-signed by Officer Les Smith and Sgt. Eric Nevins, who lead the patrol and supervisors’s unions, respectively. The police leaders expressed sorrow and frustration at Floyd’s death, and said they believe the professionalism, training and rigorous hiring standards in Portland mean there is little to no chance of a similar episode occurring in Maine. “You should know that the Portland Police Department has policies and strategies in place in order to prevent such a tragedy from happening here,” the letter said. “Our policies and training prohibit neck type restraints. They also call for our officers’ use of force to be in response to an actual or imminent threat.” The letter did not include a copy of the department’s use-of-force policy; the department has not responded to a request for a copy of the policy. In an interview early Friday afternoon, Clark said he and every other member of the department who has spoken to him about Floyd’s death has been taken aback by Chauvin’s actions, calling it “unacceptable.” “My first reaction was what if that was my brother or father or son?” Clark said. “To say it was disturbing is probably an understatement. I immediately think of the impact, wherever it is in the country, I think of the impact it’s going to have in our department and among our officers and in our community.” “Never say never, but one of the other initial reactions I had was that would not happen here,” Clark said. “That would not happen here in Maine or in the city of Portland.” Smith, the president of the local Police Benevolent Association, has more than 30 years on the job, and for the last decade has taught self defense and use-of-force classes to Portland’s officers at the state’s only police academy, in Vassalboro. “My first reaction was that (Chauvin) was not taught that at any academy and he was not taught that at the police department,” Smith said. “Our whole goal is to use just enough force to protect the officer, keep the suspect safe, and keep the civilian safe. From the perspective I saw in the video, it just seemed it was out of line. It was way, way too much.” Smith continued: “Its very frustrating to watch that happen. I put my heart and my soul into my training, and the Portland Police Department does the same. We take it very seriously. So when I see this, I take it to heart, when someone isn’t doing what they should be doing.” The death is the latest in a history of police-involved killings that stretches back years, in which mostly minority men have died at the hands of police. Some of the cases have resulted in prosecutions, while many have not. Police officers enjoy special legal protections while they perform their duties, which often include controlled acts of violence that are permitted in order to bring someone under control, or to protect themselves or bystanders. In many communities across the country and especially during the post-slavery Jim Crow era, police embodied the use of state power to reinforce a racial hierarchy and oppress non-white citizens. Although Maine does not have a deep history of Jim Crow-era oppression, black people in Maine still see disparate treatment by police, the courts and in schools, according to the ACLU of Maine. “Police departments around the country have been silent about the unnecessary killings of black people for far too long, so we are glad the Portland Police Department made this public statement,” said Alison Beyea, executive director of the ACLU of Maine. Black children in Maine face more discipline, expulsions, suspensions and arrests at school than their white peers. Black residents have also documented ill treatment by private businesses, and in March, a 38-year-old Biddeford man was found guilty on federal hate-crime charges for his role in two unprovoked attacks on black men in Portland and Biddeford. Most recently, black Mainers suffer a far greater impact from the COVID-19 pandemic than white people, Beyea said, echoing a national trend, despite Maine’s relatively small non-white population. “We wish the PPD and all Maine law enforcement would recognize and condemn the systemic racism that makes these killings so commonplace. Policies and protocols and training are important, but they won’t stop people from being killed until we address the root of the problem,” Beyea wrote. “It will take all of us acknowledging and fighting against racism to prevent the next tragic incident from happening here,” she said. Police training in recent years has evolved to acknowledge that racism and unintentional bias play a role in how everyone views others and makes decisions, including police officers, and anti-bias training is now part of Portland’s training regimen and is reinforced through rotating classes that all Maine police officers must complete annually to maintain their certification.

In Portland, two groups marched peacefully through the city with dozens of police in tow blocking traffic and clearing a path for the demonstrators. The first group assembled after 3 p.m. before City Hall, marched to the Portland police station on Middle Street, and then to Monument Square before dispersing without incident around 5 p.m. Simultaneously, another group of demonstrators blocked Franklin Street near Whole Foods for about an hour before moving to the intersection of Congress Street and High Street, shutting down what is typically one of the city’s busiest intersections. Demonstrators dispersed by about 8 p.m., and there were no signs of violence or arrests. In 2016, Black Lives Matter demonstrators marched through Portland after two black men were shot and killed by police in Louisiana and Minnesota. That protest generated more than a dozen arrests, but no one was arrested during the demonstrations on Friday, and police cleared traffic and stood by as demonstrators hurled insults at them and chanted profanities. One of the demonstrators who attended the Monument Square rally, Raymond Diamond, 24, carried a white sign painted in flowing black letters that asked, “could it have been me?” Diamond said he grew up in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, where a history of slavery, racism and oppression began before the nation’s independence and continues in subtler forms today. Although Diamond said he senses less racial tension overall in Maine, he fears he could one day be the victim of police violence simply for being black. His fear of police began when he was about 14 or 15, when Diamond watched from the passenger seat as a police officer pulled over his mother in their own neighborhood, eventually making the traffic stop in their own driveway, he said. Someone must have thought they didn’t belong there, Diamond recalled. He still remembers his mother’s anger, and her warning to him afterward. “She told me to be careful and to protect myself and to do what I had to do to come home, so she isn’t one of those mothers crying on the news,” he said. “With a history like what we have, I’m not surprised this is where we are. The police are a reflection of the state. That’s not something that we can get around.” Ahead of the local demonstrations in Portland, the Portland police chief and leaders of two labor unions representing officers released a letter to the community to say they were disturbed by Floyd’s death and the way his arrest was handled. But the local police leaders – who collectively have several decades of policing experience – did not say in the written statement released Friday whether they believe the officer should face criminal prosecution. Some police leaders around the country condemned the death as nothing short of murder, and by midday Friday, Chauvin was charged by a local prosecutor and taken into custody. He faces one count of third-degree murder and one count of manslaughter. Floyd was initially detained Monday by Minneapolis police because he matched the description of someone who tried to pay with a counterfeit bill at a convenience store. A bystander’s disturbing video shows Chauvin, who is white, kneeling on Floyd’s neck, even as Floyd begs for air and slowly stops talking and moving. The statement on Friday from Portland’s chief of police, Frank Clark, was co-signed by Officer Les Smith and Sgt. Eric Nevins, who lead the patrol and supervisors’s unions, respectively. The police leaders expressed sorrow and frustration at Floyd’s death, and said they believe the professionalism, training and rigorous hiring standards in Portland mean there is little to no chance of a similar episode occurring in Maine. “You should know that the Portland Police Department has policies and strategies in place in order to prevent such a tragedy from happening here,” the letter said. “Our policies and training prohibit neck type restraints. They also call for our officers’ use of force to be in response to an actual or imminent threat.” The letter did not include a copy of the department’s use-of-force policy; the department has not responded to a request for a copy of the policy. In an interview early Friday afternoon, Clark said he and every other member of the department who has spoken to him about Floyd’s death has been taken aback by Chauvin’s actions, calling it “unacceptable.” “My first reaction was what if that was my brother or father or son?” Clark said. “To say it was disturbing is probably an understatement. I immediately think of the impact, wherever it is in the country, I think of the impact it’s going to have in our department and among our officers and in our community.” “Never say never, but one of the other initial reactions I had was that would not happen here,” Clark said. “That would not happen here in Maine or in the city of Portland.” Smith, the president of the local Police Benevolent Association, has more than 30 years on the job, and for the last decade has taught self defense and use-of-force classes to Portland’s officers at the state’s only police academy, in Vassalboro. “My first reaction was that (Chauvin) was not taught that at any academy and he was not taught that at the police department,” Smith said. “Our whole goal is to use just enough force to protect the officer, keep the suspect safe, and keep the civilian safe. From the perspective I saw in the video, it just seemed it was out of line. It was way, way too much.” Smith continued: “Its very frustrating to watch that happen. I put my heart and my soul into my training, and the Portland Police Department does the same. We take it very seriously. So when I see this, I take it to heart, when someone isn’t doing what they should be doing.” The death is the latest in a history of police-involved killings that stretches back years, in which mostly minority men have died at the hands of police. Some of the cases have resulted in prosecutions, while many have not. Police officers enjoy special legal protections while they perform their duties, which often include controlled acts of violence that are permitted in order to bring someone under control, or to protect themselves or bystanders. In many communities across the country and especially during the post-slavery Jim Crow era, police embodied the use of state power to reinforce a racial hierarchy and oppress non-white citizens. Although Maine does not have a deep history of Jim Crow-era oppression, black people in Maine still see disparate treatment by police, the courts and in schools, according to the ACLU of Maine. “Police departments around the country have been silent about the unnecessary killings of black people for far too long, so we are glad the Portland Police Department made this public statement,” said Alison Beyea, executive director of the ACLU of Maine. Black children in Maine face more discipline, expulsions, suspensions and arrests at school than their white peers. Black residents have also documented ill treatment by private businesses, and in March, a 38-year-old Biddeford man was found guilty on federal hate-crime charges for his role in two unprovoked attacks on black men in Portland and Biddeford. Most recently, black Mainers suffer a far greater impact from the COVID-19 pandemic than white people, Beyea said, echoing a national trend, despite Maine’s relatively small non-white population. “We wish the PPD and all Maine law enforcement would recognize and condemn the systemic racism that makes these killings so commonplace. Policies and protocols and training are important, but they won’t stop people from being killed until we address the root of the problem,” Beyea wrote. “It will take all of us acknowledging and fighting against racism to prevent the next tragic incident from happening here,” she said. Police training in recent years has evolved to acknowledge that racism and unintentional bias play a role in how everyone views others and makes decisions, including police officers, and anti-bias training is now part of Portland’s training regimen and is reinforced through rotating classes that all Maine police officers must complete annually to maintain their certification.

George Floyd, 46, died after Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin was caught on camera kneeling on Floyd’s neck as he begged for breath before he lost consciousness. When paramedics arrived, he had no pulse and was unresponsive. Chauvin was arrested and charged with murder Friday, but not before outraged residents of Minneapolis and neighboring St. Paul demonstrated through the night, plunging the cities into unrest and chaos.

1620284019,2020-05-29 12:16:12,Governor acknowledges 'abject failure' in protest response,https://www.fosters.com/zz/news/20200529/governor-acknowledges-abject-failure-in-protest-response?rssfeed=true,en,False,,661135,Sanford News,http://www.fosters.com/apps/pbcs.dll/section?category=SANNEWS,"MINNEAPOLIS — With smoke drifting over Minneapolis, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz on Friday acknowledged the ""abject failure"" of the response to this week's violent protests and called for swift justice for police involved in the death of George Floyd, a handcuffed black man who pleaded for air as a white officer knelt on his neck. Walz said the state would take over the response and that it's time to show respect and dignity to those who are suffering. ""Minneapolis and St. Paul are on fire. The fire is still smoldering in our streets. The ashes are symbolic of decades and generations of pain, of anguish unheard,"" Walz said, adding. ""Now generations of pain is manifesting itself in front of the world — and the world is watching."" The governor cited a call he received from a state senator who described her district ""on fire, no police, no firefighters, no social control, constituents locked in houses wondering what they were going to do. That is an abject failure that cannot happen."" His comments came the morning after protesters torched a police station that officers abandoned during a third night of violence. Livestream video showed protesters entering the building, where intentionally set fires activated smoke alarms and sprinklers. President Donald Trump threatened action, tweeting ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts,"" which prompted a warning from Twitter for ""glorifying violence."" The governor faced tough questions after National Guard leader Maj. Gen. Jon Jensen blamed a lack of clarity about the Guard's mission for a slow response. Walz said the state was in a supporting role and that it was up to city leaders to run the situation. Walz said it became apparent as the 3rd Precinct was lost that the state had to step in, which happened at 12:05 a.m. Requests from the cities for resources ""never came,"" he said. ""You will not see that tonight, there will be no lack of leadership,"" Walz said. Dozens of fires were also set in nearby St. Paul, where nearly 200 businesses were damaged or looted. Protests spread across the U.S., fueled by outrage over Floyd's death, and years of violence against African Americans at the hands of police. Demonstrators clashed with officers in New York and blocked traffic in Columbus, Ohio, and Denver. Trump threatened to bring Minneapolis ""under control,"" calling the protesters ""thugs"" and tweeting that ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts."" The tweet drew another warning from Twitter, which said the comment violated the platform's rules, but the company did not remove it. Trump also blasted the ""total lack of leadership"" in Minneapolis. A visibly tired and frustrated Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey made his first public appearance of the night early Friday at City Hall and took responsibility for evacuating the precinct, saying it had become too dangerous for officers. As Frey continued, a reporter cut across loudly with a question: ""What's the plan here?"" ""With regard to?"" Frey responded. Then he added: ""There is a lot of pain and anger right now in our city. I understand that ... What we have seen over the past several hours and past couple of nights here in terms of looting is unacceptable."" He defended the city's lack of engagement with looters — only a handful of arrests across the first two nights of violence — and said, ""We are doing absolutely everything that we can to keep the peace."" He said National Guard members were stationed in locations to help stem looting, including at banks, grocery stores and pharmacies. The Minnesota State Patrol arrested a CNN television crew early Friday as the journalists reported on the unrest. While live on air, CNN reporter Omar Jimenez was handcuffed and led away. A producer and a photojournalist for CNN were also taken away in handcuffs. The Minnesota State Patrol said the journalists were among four people arrested as troopers were ""clearing the streets and restoring order,"" and they were released after being confirmed to be media members. CNN said on Twitter that the arrests were ""a clear violation of their First Amendment rights."" Firefighters worked Friday to contain a number of blazes as National Guard troops blocked access to streets where businesses had been damaged. They marched side by side and block by block as they expanded a perimeter around a heavily damaged area. Protests first erupted Tuesday, a day after Floyd's death in a confrontation with police captured on widely seen citizen video. In the footage, Floyd can be seen pleading as officer Derek Chauvin presses his knee against him. As minutes pass, Floyd slowly stops talking and moving. Minutes after the precinct burned, the Guard tweeted that it had activated more than 500 soldiers across the metro area. By Friday morning, a couple dozen Guard members armed with assault-style rifles blocked a street near a Target store that has sustained heavy damage by looters. The Guard said a ""key objective"" was to make sure firefighters could respond to calls, and said in a follow-up tweet that soldiers would assist the Minneapolis Fire Department. But no move was made to put out the 3rd Precinct fire. Assistant Fire Chief Bryan Tyner said fire crews could not safely respond to blazes at the precinct station and some surrounding buildings. Elsewhere in Minneapolis, thousands of peaceful demonstrators marched through the streets calling for justice. In New York City, protesters defied New York's coronavirus prohibition on public gatherings Thursday, clashing with police, while demonstrators blocked traffic in downtown Denver and downtown Columbus. A day earlier, demonstrators had taken to the streets in Los Angeles and Memphis. About 10 protesters went to a Florida home believed to belong to Chauvin. The Orange County Sheriff's Office tweeted Friday that Chauvin was not at the residence and has no plans to be in the area. In Louisville, Kentucky, police confirmed that at least seven people had been shot Thursday night as protesters demanded justice for Breonna Taylor, a black woman who was fatally shot by police in her home in March. In Mississippi, the mayor of the community of Petal resisted calls to resign following his remarks about Floyd's death. Hal Marx, a Republican, asked on Twitter: ""Why in the world would anyone choose to become a police officer in our society today?"" In a follow-up tweet, he said he ""didn't see anything unreasonable."" The city on Thursday released a transcript of the 911 call that brought police to the grocery store where Floyd was arrested. The caller described someone paying with a counterfeit bill, with workers rushing outside to find the man sitting on a van. The caller described the man as ""awfully drunk"" and said he was ""not in control of himself."" Asked by the 911 operator whether the man was ""under the influence of something,"" the caller said: ""Something like that, yes. He is not acting right."" Police said Floyd matched the caller's description of the suspect. State and federal authorities are investigating Floyd's death. Chauvin, the officer who knelt on Floyd's neck, was fired Tuesday, along with three other officers involved in the arrest. ___ Associated Press writers Steve Karnowski, Jeff Baenen and Doug Glass in Minneapolis, Gretchen Ehlke in Milwaukee, and Aaron Morrison in New York contributed to this report.",0.0
1620305830,2020-05-29 13:31:02,Minneapolis police officer who put knee on man’s neck as he died has been arrested,https://www.pressherald.com/2020/05/29/minnesota-police-officer-who-knelt-on-mans-neck-has-been-arrested-in-his-death/,en,False,,366984,pressherald.com,http://pressherald.com/,"MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — The white Minneapolis police officer who pressed his knee into George Floyd’s neck as he begged for air was arrested Friday and charged with murder, as authorities imposed overnight curfews to try to stem violent protests over police killings of African Americans that have spread to cities across the country. Thousands of protesters marched through downtown Minneapolis past curfew and encircled a police precinct station. “Prosecute the police!” some chanted, and “Say his name: George Floyd!” There was no violence, but some protesters sprayed graffiti on buildings. Elsewhere in the city, officers fired tear gas and rubber bullets to drive back crowds of protesters. It wasn’t clear if — or how — authorities would enforce the curfew amid sharp questions about how city and state leaders have handled the crisis. The restrictions came a night after protesters torched an abandoned police station. The renewed protests come the same day Officer Derek Chauvin, 44, was charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. He also was accused of ignoring another officer who expressed concerns about Floyd as he lay handcuffed on the ground, pleading that he could not breathe as Chauvin pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes. Floyd, who was black, had been arrested on suspicion of using a counterfeit bill at a store. Related Hundreds fill Portland streets to protest Minneapolis police killing Chauvin, who was fired along with three other officers who were at the scene, faces more than 12 years in prison if convicted of murder. An attorney for Floyd’s family welcomed the arrest but said he expected a more serious murder charge and wants the other officers arrested, too. Prosecutor Mike Freeman said more charges were possible, but authorities “felt it appropriate to focus on the most dangerous perpetrator.” Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey’s curfew also will be in place Saturday, and nearby cities announced similar restrictions. “I know that whatever hope you feel today is tempered with skepticism and a righteous outrage,” Frey said in a statement. “Today’s decision from the County Attorney is an essential first step on a longer road toward justice and healing our city.” Protests nationwide are fueled by outrage over Floyd’s death and years of police violence against African Americans. Protesters smashed windows at CNN headquarters in Atlanta, set a police car on fire and struck officers with bottles. Large demonstrations in New York, Houston, Washington, D.C., and other cities ranged from people peacefully blocking roads to clashing with police. “You are disgracing our city,” Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms told protesters. “You are disgracing the life of George Floyd and every other person who has been killed in this country.” Police were trying to put Floyd in a squad car Monday when he stiffened and fell to the ground, saying he was claustrophobic, a criminal complaint said. Chauvin and Officer Tou Thoa arrived and tried several times to get the struggling Floyd into the car. Chauvin pulled Floyd out of the passenger side, and the handcuffed Floyd went to the ground face down. Officer J.K. Kueng held Floyd’s back and Officer Thomas Lane held his legs while Chauvin put his knee on Floyd’s head and neck area, the complaint said. When Lane asked if Floyd should be rolled onto his side, Chauvin said, “No, staying put is where we got him.” Lane said he was “worried about excited delirium or whatever.” An autopsy said the combined effects of being restrained, potential intoxicants in Floyd’s system and his underlying health issues, including heart disease, likely contributed to his death. It revealed nothing to support strangulation as the cause of death. There were no other details about intoxicants, and toxicology results can take weeks. In the 911 call that drew police, the caller describes the man suspected of paying with counterfeit money as “awfully drunk and he’s not in control of himself.” After Floyd apparently stopped breathing, Lane again said he wanted to roll Floyd onto his side. Kueng checked for a pulse and said he could not find one, according to the complaint. Chauvin had his knee on Floyd’s neck for 8 minutes, 46 seconds, including nearly three minutes after Floyd stopped moving and talking, the complaint said. Chauvin’s attorney had no comment when reached by The Associated Press. The prosecutor highlighted the “extraordinary speed” in charging the case four days after Floyd’s death and defended himself against questions about why it did not happen sooner. Freeman said his office needed time to gather evidence, including what he called the “horrible” video recorded by a bystander. News of the arrest came moments after Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz acknowledged the “abject failure” in responding to this week’s protests and called for swift justice for the officers. Walz said the state took the lead after the police station burned. “Minneapolis and St. Paul are on fire. The fire is still smoldering in our streets. The ashes are symbolic of decades and generations of pain, of anguish unheard,” Walz said. “Now generations of pain is manifesting itself in front of the world — and the world is watching.” President Trump threatened action, tweeting “when the looting starts, the shooting starts,” which prompted a warning from Twitter for “glorifying violence.” Trump later said he was referring to shooting that had happened during the protests. Later, the president said he’d spoken to Floyd’s family and “expressed my sorrow.” Trump called video of the arrest “just a horrible thing to witness and to watch. It certainly looked like there was no excuse for it.” Attorney Benjamin Crump, who is representing Floyd’s family, asked to take custody of Floyd’s body for an independent autopsy. The doctor who will do the autopsy is Michael Baden, former chief medical examiner of New York City, who was hired to do an autopsy for Eric Garner, a black man who died in 2014 after New York police placed him in a chokehold and he pleaded that he could not breathe. State and federal authorities also are investigating Floyd’s death. The owner of a popular Latin nightclub said Floyd and Chauvin both worked as security guards there as recently as last year, but it’s not clear whether they worked together. Chauvin served as an off-duty security guard at the El Nuevo Rodeo club for nearly two decades, and Floyd had worked there more recently for about a dozen events featuring African American music, Maya Santamaria told the AP. Santamaria, who recently sold the venue, said Chauvin got along well with the regular Latino customers but did not like to work the African American nights. When he did, and there was a fight, he would spray people with mace and call for police backup and half-dozen squad cars would soon show up, something she felt was “overkill.” Send questions/comments to the editors. « Previous Next »",0.0

Prosecutor Mike Freeman said more charges were possible, but authorities “felt it appropriate to focus on the most dangerous perpetrator.” Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey’s curfew also will be in place Saturday, and nearby cities announced similar restrictions. “I know that whatever hope you feel today is tempered with skepticism and a righteous outrage,” Frey said in a statement. “Today’s decision from the County Attorney is an essential first step on a longer road toward justice and healing our city.” Protests nationwide are fueled by outrage over Floyd’s death and years of police violence against African Americans. Protesters smashed windows at CNN headquarters in Atlanta, set a police car on fire and struck officers with bottles. Large demonstrations in New York, Houston, Washington, D.C., and other cities ranged from people peacefully blocking roads to clashing with police. “You are disgracing our city,” Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms told protesters. “You are disgracing the life of George Floyd and every other person who has been killed in this country.” Police were trying to put Floyd in a squad car Monday when he stiffened and fell to the ground, saying he was claustrophobic, a criminal complaint said. Chauvin and Officer Tou Thoa arrived and tried several times to get the struggling Floyd into the car. Chauvin pulled Floyd out of the passenger side, and the handcuffed Floyd went to the ground face down. Officer J.K. Kueng held Floyd’s back and Officer Thomas Lane held his legs while Chauvin put his knee on Floyd’s head and neck area, the complaint said. When Lane asked if Floyd should be rolled onto his side, Chauvin said, “No, staying put is where we got him.” Lane said he was “worried about excited delirium or whatever.” An autopsy said the combined effects of being restrained, potential intoxicants in Floyd’s system and his underlying health issues, including heart disease, likely contributed to his death. It revealed nothing to support strangulation as the cause of death. There were no other details about intoxicants, and toxicology results can take weeks. In the 911 call that drew police, the caller describes the man suspected of paying with counterfeit money as “awfully drunk and he’s not in control of himself.” After Floyd apparently stopped breathing, Lane again said he wanted to roll Floyd onto his side. Kueng checked for a pulse and said he could not find one, according to the complaint. Chauvin had his knee on Floyd’s neck for 8 minutes, 46 seconds, including nearly three minutes after Floyd stopped moving and talking, the complaint said. Chauvin’s attorney had no comment when reached by The Associated Press. The prosecutor highlighted the “extraordinary speed” in charging the case four days after Floyd’s death and defended himself against questions about why it did not happen sooner. Freeman said his office needed time to gather evidence, including what he called the “horrible” video recorded by a bystander. News of the arrest came moments after Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz acknowledged the “abject failure” in responding to this week’s protests and called for swift justice for the officers. Walz said the state took the lead after the police station burned. “Minneapolis and St. Paul are on fire. The fire is still smoldering in our streets. The ashes are symbolic of decades and generations of pain, of anguish unheard,” Walz said. “Now generations of pain is manifesting itself in front of the world — and the world is watching.” President Trump threatened action, tweeting “when the looting starts, the shooting starts,” which prompted a warning from Twitter for “glorifying violence.” Trump later said he was referring to shooting that had happened during the protests. Later, the president said he’d spoken to Floyd’s family and “expressed my sorrow.” Trump called video of the arrest “just a horrible thing to witness and to watch. It certainly looked like there was no excuse for it.” Attorney Benjamin Crump, who is representing Floyd’s family, asked to take custody of Floyd’s body for an independent autopsy. The doctor who will do the autopsy is Michael Baden, former chief medical examiner of New York City, who was hired to do an autopsy for Eric Garner, a black man who died in 2014 after New York police placed him in a chokehold and he pleaded that he could not breathe. State and federal authorities also are investigating Floyd’s death. The owner of a popular Latin nightclub said Floyd and Chauvin both worked as security guards there as recently as last year, but it’s not clear whether they worked together. Chauvin served as an off-duty security guard at the El Nuevo Rodeo club for nearly two decades, and Floyd had worked there more recently for about a dozen events featuring African American music, Maya Santamaria told the AP. Santamaria, who recently sold the venue, said Chauvin got along well with the regular Latino customers but did not like to work the African American nights. When he did, and there was a fight, he would spray people with mace and call for police backup and half-dozen squad cars would soon show up, something she felt was “overkill.” Send questions/comments to the editors. « Previous Next »",0.0

Former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin has been charged with murder and manslaughter in the death of George Floyd. Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman said Chauvin is charged with third degree murder, but they are continuing to review evidence and there may be subsequent charges later. The manslaughter charge is second degree. RELATED: What is 3rd-degree murder and 2nd-degree manslaughter in Minnesota? Freeman said they focused on the ""most dangerous"" perpetrator first, but the other three officers involved in Floyd's arrest are under investigation and he anticipates charges against them as well. The criminal complaint states that Chauvin was the officer seen on video with his knee on Floyd's neck while Floyd was pleading, ""I can't breathe."" ""This is by far the fastest we've ever charged a police officer,"" Freeman said, referring to the video as ""horrible, horrific, terrible."" He said that in addition to that bystander video, they have officers' body-worn cameras, witness statements, the preliminary Medical Examiner's report, and expert opinions as evidence. ""Normally these cases take nine months to a year,"" Freeman said. ""We have to charge these cases very carefully because we have the difficult burden of proof."" When asked whether public unrest factored into the speed, Freeman said, ""I’m not insensitive to what’s happened in the streets."" But he maintained that his job is to charge when his office has ""sufficient evidence."" ""I will not allow us to charge a case before it is ready,"" Freeman said. ""This case is now ready, and we have charged it."" RELATED: MPD Third Precinct burns as protests continue following George Floyd's death RELATED: 'Justice for George Floyd' is fastest growing Change.org petition ever Freeman said that the charges are the same ones levied against former Minneapolis police officer Mohamed Noor in the death of Justine Ruszczyk Damond. According to the criminal complaint in the Floyd case, two officers responded to a report of someone using a counterfeit $20 bill at the Cup Foods on 37th and Chicago Avenue. Officers Thomas Lane and J.A. Kueng were told the man was sitting in a car parked around the corner, on 38th Street. The complaint says Lane began speaking with Floyd, who was in the driver's seat of the car, and then pulled his gun and told Floyd to show his hands. When Floyd put his hands on the steering wheel, Lane put his gun back. According to the complaint, Lane ordered Floyd out of the car, then pulled him out and handcuffed him. Floyd ""actively resisted being handcuffed,"" but then became compliant and sat on the sidewalk at Lane's direction. The attorney's office says in the complaint that Floyd and Lang had a conversation for just under two minutes, and then both officers stood Floyd up and tried to walk him to their squad. At that point, the charges state that Floyd ""stiffened up, fell to the ground, and told the officers he was claustrophobic."" That's when officers Derek Chauvin and Tou Thoa arrived as backup. They made ""several attempts"" to get Floyd into the backseat of the car and ""Floyd did not voluntarily get in the car and struggled with the officers by intentionally falling down, saying he was not going int the car, and refusing to stand still,"" the complaint says. George Floyd Photo courtesy: Benjamin Crump via TMX.news RELATED: Transcript of 911 call on George Floyd released RELATED: Surveillance video captures early moments of George Floyd's encounter with police According to the complaint, Floyd said he could not breathe while he was standing up, and began repeating it. The complaint says officers tried to get Floyd into the car from the passenger side, and and at 8:19 p.m. Chauvin pulled Floyd out of the car. ""Mr. Floyd went to the ground face down and still handcuffed,"" the complaint narrative then reads. ""Kueng held Mr. Floyd’s back and Lane held his legs. The defendant placed his left knee in the area of Mr. Floyd’s head and neck. Mr. Floyd said, 'I can’t breathe' multiple times and repeatedly said, 'Mama' and 'please,' as well. The defendant and the other two officers stayed in their positions."" According to the complaint, the officers told Floyd, ""you are talking fine."" Lane asked if they should roll him on his side, and Chauvin said, ""No, staying put where we got him."" The complaint says that Lane asked again, ""I am worried about excited delirium or whatever,"" and Chauvin said, ""That's why we have him on his stomach."" ""None of the three officers moved from their positions,"" the complaint says. The body-worn camera footage investigators examined showed that Floyd stopped moving at 8:24:24, and stopped breathing or speaking at 8:25:31. Kueng checked Floyd's wrist for a pulse and said ""I couldn't find one,"" but none of the officers moved until 8:27:24, when Chauvin removed his knee from Floyd's neck, according to the complaint. The autopsy report is pending but preliminary findings show that Floyd had underlying health conditions including coronary artery disease and hypertensive heart disease. ""The combined effects of Mr. Floyd being restrained by the police, his underlying health conditions and any potential intoxicants in his system likely contributed to his death,"" the report says, with no evidence of traumatic asphyxia or strangulation. Prosecutors ended the criminal complaint by saying, ""The defendant had his knee on Mr. Floyd’s neck for 8 minutes and 46 seconds in total. Two minutes and 53 seconds of this was after Mr. Floyd was non-responsive. Police are trained that this type of restraint with a subject in a prone position is inherently dangerous."" In a letter to Gov. Walz Friday afternoon, the Minneapolis Delegation requested that the case be handled by the Attorney General's Office rather than the Hennepin County Attorney. The letter, which was written in collaboration by Representatives Fue Lee (59A), Raymond Dehn (59B), Sydney Jordan (60A), Mohamud Noor (60B), Frank Hornstein (61A), Jamie Long (61B), Hodan Hassan (62A), Aisha Gomez (62B), Jim Davnie (63A), Jean Wagenius (63B), reads: We are writing to request that the case against the police officers who killed George Floyd, or may have been otherwise culpable in his death, be transferred to the jurisdiction of the Attorney General's office. Unfortunately, our constituents, especially constituents of color, have lost faith in the ability of Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman to fairly and impartially investigate and prosecute these cases. Freeman's press conference on May 28th, in which he seemed ill-prepared and suggested that there was unseen exculpatory evidence that might exonerate the officers, further ruptured this trust. Given the present circumstances, we believe that this case should be handled in a way that maximizes public trust and gives confidence to the public that justice will be done. Under the circumstances, transferring the case to the Attorney General's office would be one of the most decisive actions that you could take to calm public anger and guarantee a fair process. Attorney General Ellison has earned goodwill of Minneapolis residents through years of service to the city, and is known and respected throughout the community. It is imperative to signal to our constituents, as strongly and quickly as possible, that the authorities are treating this case with the special attention it deserves, and to demonstrate that all Minnesotans are equal in the eyes of the law. RELATED: Officers identified in George Floyd death, Minneapolis mayor calls for charges RELATED: Two fired Mpls. officers had past history of complaints Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey issued a statement in response to the charges Friday, saying, ""We are a nation at a crossroad, and today’s decision from the County Attorney is an essential first step on a longer road toward justice and healing our city."" “What’s happened in Minneapolis is bigger than any one city and any single event,” said Frey. “For our Black community who have, for centuries, been forced to endure injustice in a world simply unwilling to correct or acknowledge it: I know that whatever hope you feel today is tempered with skepticism and a righteous outrage."" Minnesota Department of Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington announced earlier Friday during a different news conference that Chauvin had been arrested. The BCA confirms that he was taken into custody at 11:44 a.m. Friday in Minneapolis. Meanwhile, Governor Tim Walz held a news conference at 10:30 a.m. after another night of violence and looting in Minneapolis and St. Paul, as protests over the death of George Floyd devolved into riots. Walz said he received a call from State Sen. Patricia Torres Ray Thursday that District 63 was burning, and there were no police officers or Minnesota National Guard troops to help. “That is an abject failure that cannot happen,"" Walz said. ""We must restore that order.” Harrington said that national guard troops were called in to help Thursday, but they did not receive a “specific mission” to help clear the streets until midnight, on a call with the mayor. Harrington said Minneapolis Mayor Frey informed them they had ""no more resources"" and they were not able to meet public safety needs on Lake Street. ""When the Third Precinct was abandoned, it seemed that that was the time to move,"" Gov. Walz said. They then had to get a plan together, Harrington said. By the time they brought state patrol, Minnesota National Guard, and other assisting crews to Lake Street, he said it was 3 a.m. They arrested some people at that time and for other looting incidents throughout the day, Harrington said, but he did not have numbers on how many. He said most people left peacefully. Harrington said the people who were out at that hour were not the people of Minneapolis “who are still having their guts ripped out about the Floyd murder.” “I don’t want to prejudice this,” he said regarding using the term “murder.” “I’m just calling it like I see it.” RELATED: Former President Obama issues statement over George Floyd's death RELATED: Memorial grows, mural created to honor George Floyd “I can tell you that no one could have heard Mr. Floyd’s voice in the chaos of the screaming and the shouting and the fires at 1 o’clock in the morning on Lake Street,” he said. “My job is to make sure the community is safe and the team is ready and prepared to keep it safe.” Harrington said his team, including the national guard, state troopers and DNR, is confident that they can make a plan to keep people safe Friday night while protecting First Amendment rights to protest. “We will create a plan that will keep the peace, maintain the peace, and prevent further lawless behavior in the city of Minneapolis, the city of St. Paul and surrounding suburbs,” he said. The governor acknowledged that the ""tools"" needed to restore order, including the Minnesota National Guard, are ""the very same tools that have led to that grief and pain."" Those national guard troops are armed, officials confirmed Friday, and maintain the right to defend themselves, though they would not comment further on the boundaries around their use of force. ""I’m asking you to help us. Help us use a humane way to get the streets to a place where we can restore the justice,"" he said. ""So those who are demanding justice can be heard. Not those who throw fire bombs into businesses."" Walz said that he has spoken with Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman and he is confident that ""justice will be swift, that it will come in a timely manner, and that it will be fair."" ""You're seeing holes in planning,"" Walz said, ""that's for dang sure."" He said Minnesotans can expect to hear what the plan is for Friday night by 2 p.m. ""Tonight needs to be different,"" Walz said. He promised that state troops would step into the gap.

""Ask yourself, what’s going on there?"" he said. ""And is it something that we as a society absolutely must pay attention to? I think we must pay attention."" Ellison pointed out that as Minnesota National Guard troops are deployed to maintain order, they are the same people who were administering COVID-19 tests across the state last week. ""Don’t react to them the way you might react to the Minneapolis Police Department,"" he said. ""It’s not the same group. They have different leadership, different authority, and their job is to try to bring peace and calm back again. Please remember that this is not the group you associate with unfair conduct."" Walz said Friday that he believes the public has ""lost faith"" in the Minneapolis Police Department. The state's response came as businesses and homes continued to burn Thursday night and Friday morning. Just after 10:30 p.m., a crowd stormed the building housing the Minneapolis Police Department's Third Precinct, setting it on fire. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey held a press conference just after 1 a.m. to address the continued unrest across the city. Frey said rioting posed an imminent threat to the safety of the officers and staffers within MPD's Third Precinct, forcing him to make the decision to evacuate the compound. “Symbolism of a building cannot outweigh the importance of life or the public,” Frey said. “We could not risk serious injury to anyone… brick and mortar is not as important as life.” However, he went on to say that progress during this crisis would not come from the government alone. “We additionally need help from the community. We need to make sure that people are looking out for our city right now. It's not just enough to do the right thing for yourself. We need to make sure that all of us are upholding the ideals that we stand by.” Although the mayor acknowledged the pain and frustration in recent days, he made it clear, the devastation is unacceptable. “What we have seen over the past couple of nights in terms of looting is unacceptable. These are businesses. These are community institutions that we need. These are banks that people rely on to get cash, grocery stores that people rely on to get food … We need to ensure that they are protected.” In St. Paul, fires burned in buildings across the street from Allianz Field. According to a post from the Saint Paul Police Department, more than 170 businesses have been damaged or looted along with dozens of fires. President Trump also weighed in on Twitter late Thursday night, blaming the emergent social disturbance on a lack of local leadership, and threatened to send in the federal National Guard unless the city was brought under control. The president went on to tweet, ""These THUGS are dishonoring the memory of George Floyd, and I won’t let that happen. Just spoke to Governor Tim Walz and told him that the Military is with him all the way. Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts. Thank you!"" Twitter has since removed a portion of the president's tweet, citing violations of their user policy for glorifying violence. Trump tweeted again Friday saying, ""The National Guard has arrived on the scene. They are in Minneapolis and fully prepared. George Floyd will not have died in vain. Respect his memory!!!""

Thousands of protesters marched through downtown Minneapolis past curfew and encircled a police precinct station. “Prosecute the police!” some chanted, and “Say his name: George Floyd!” There was no violence, but some protesters sprayed graffiti on buildings. Elsewhere in the city, officers fired tear gas and rubber bullets to drive back crowds of protesters. It wasn’t clear if — or how — authorities would enforce the curfew amid sharp questions about how city and state leaders have handled the crisis. The restrictions came a night after protesters torched an abandoned police station. The renewed protests come the same day Officer Derek Chauvin, 44, was charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. He also was accused of ignoring another officer who expressed concerns about Floyd as he lay handcuffed on the ground, pleading that he could not breathe as Chauvin pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes. Floyd, who was black, had been arrested on suspicion of using a counterfeit bill at a store.

1620325426,2020-05-29 12:36:40,Portland police chief speaks out about Minneapolis police killing,https://www.sunjournal.com/2020/05/29/portland-police-chief-speaks-out-about-minneapolis-police-killing/,en,False,,68001,sunjournal.com,http://www.sunjournal.com/#spider,"Hundreds of people marched through Portland on Friday to protest police violence against people of color, in one of many demonstrations around the nation following the death of a black man who was detained by police in Minneapolis on Monday. George Floyd, 46, died after Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin was caught on camera kneeling on Floyd’s neck as he begged for breath before he lost consciousness. When paramedics arrived, he had no pulse and was unresponsive. Chauvin was arrested and charged with murder Friday, but not before outraged residents of Minneapolis and neighboring St. Paul demonstrated through the night, plunging the cities into unrest and chaos. The protests have spread across the nation, with groups taking to the streets from New York to California and Colorado to Florida to Atlanta. Some of the demonstrations have been peaceful, but others have led to vandalism and confrontations with police. In Portland, two groups marched peacefully through the city with dozens of police in tow blocking traffic and clearing a path for the demonstrators. The first group assembled after 3 p.m. before City Hall, marched to the Portland police station on Middle Street, and then to Monument Square before dispersing without incident around 5 p.m. Simultaneously, another group of demonstrators blocked Franklin Street near Whole Foods for about an hour before moving to the intersection of Congress Street and High Street, shutting down what is typically one of the city’s busiest intersections. Demonstrators dispersed by about 8 p.m., and there were no signs of violence or arrests. In 2016, Black Lives Matter demonstrators marched through Portland after two black men were shot and killed by police in Louisiana and Minnesota. That protest generated more than a dozen arrests, but no one was arrested during the demonstrations on Friday, and police cleared traffic and stood by as demonstrators hurled insults at them and chanted profanities. One of the demonstrators who attended the Monument Square rally, Raymond Diamond, 24, carried a white sign painted in flowing black letters that asked, “could it have been me?” Diamond said he grew up in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, where a history of slavery, racism and oppression began before the nation’s independence and continues in subtler forms today. Although Diamond said he senses less racial tension overall in Maine, he fears he could one day be the victim of police violence simply for being black. His fear of police began when he was about 14 or 15, when Diamond watched from the passenger seat as a police officer pulled over his mother in their own neighborhood, eventually making the traffic stop in their own driveway, he said. Someone must have thought they didn’t belong there, Diamond recalled. He still remembers his mother’s anger, and her warning to him afterward. “She told me to be careful and to protect myself and to do what I had to do to come home, so she isn’t one of those mothers crying on the news,” he said. “With a history like what we have, I’m not surprised this is where we are. The police are a reflection of the state. That’s not something that we can get around.” Ahead of the local demonstrations in Portland, the Portland police chief and leaders of two labor unions representing officers released a letter to the community to say they were disturbed by Floyd’s death and the way his arrest was handled. But the local police leaders – who collectively have several decades of policing experience – did not say in the written statement released Friday whether they believe the officer should face criminal prosecution. Some police leaders around the country condemned the death as nothing short of murder, and by midday Friday, Chauvin was charged by a local prosecutor and taken into custody. He faces one count of third-degree murder and one count of manslaughter. Floyd was initially detained Monday by Minneapolis police because he matched the description of someone who tried to pay with a counterfeit bill at a convenience store. A bystander’s disturbing video shows Chauvin, who is white, kneeling on Floyd’s neck, even as Floyd begs for air and slowly stops talking and moving. The statement on Friday from Portland’s chief of police, Frank Clark, was co-signed by Officer Les Smith and Sgt. Eric Nevins, who lead the patrol and supervisors’s unions, respectively. The police leaders expressed sorrow and frustration at Floyd’s death, and said they believe the professionalism, training and rigorous hiring standards in Portland mean there is little to no chance of a similar episode occurring in Maine. “You should know that the Portland Police Department has policies and strategies in place in order to prevent such a tragedy from happening here,” the letter said. “Our policies and training prohibit neck type restraints. They also call for our officers’ use of force to be in response to an actual or imminent threat.” The letter did not include a copy of the department’s use-of-force policy; the department has not responded to a request for a copy of the policy. In an interview early Friday afternoon, Clark said he and every other member of the department who has spoken to him about Floyd’s death has been taken aback by Chauvin’s actions, calling it “unacceptable.” “My first reaction was what if that was my brother or father or son?” Clark said. “To say it was disturbing is probably an understatement. I immediately think of the impact, wherever it is in the country, I think of the impact it’s going to have in our department and among our officers and in our community.” “Never say never, but one of the other initial reactions I had was that would not happen here,” Clark said. “That would not happen here in Maine or in the city of Portland.” Smith, the president of the local Police Benevolent Association, has more than 30 years on the job, and for the last decade has taught self defense and use-of-force classes to Portland’s officers at the state’s only police academy, in Vassalboro. “My first reaction was that (Chauvin) was not taught that at any academy and he was not taught that at the police department,” Smith said. “Our whole goal is to use just enough force to protect the officer, keep the suspect safe, and keep the civilian safe. From the perspective I saw in the video, it just seemed it was out of line. It was way, way too much.” Smith continued: “Its very frustrating to watch that happen. I put my heart and my soul into my training, and the Portland Police Department does the same. We take it very seriously. So when I see this, I take it to heart, when someone isn’t doing what they should be doing.” The death is the latest in a history of police-involved killings that stretches back years, in which mostly minority men have died at the hands of police. Some of the cases have resulted in prosecutions, while many have not. Police officers enjoy special legal protections while they perform their duties, which often include controlled acts of violence that are permitted in order to bring someone under control, or to protect themselves or bystanders. In many communities across the country and especially during the post-slavery Jim Crow era, police embodied the use of state power to reinforce a racial hierarchy and oppress non-white citizens. Although Maine does not have a deep history of Jim Crow-era oppression, black people in Maine still see disparate treatment by police, the courts and in schools, according to the ACLU of Maine. “Police departments around the country have been silent about the unnecessary killings of black people for far too long, so we are glad the Portland Police Department made this public statement,” said Alison Beyea, executive director of the ACLU of Maine. Black children in Maine face more discipline, expulsions, suspensions and arrests at school than their white peers. Black residents have also documented ill treatment by private businesses, and in March, a 38-year-old Biddeford man was found guilty on federal hate-crime charges for his role in two unprovoked attacks on black men in Portland and Biddeford. Most recently, black Mainers suffer a far greater impact from the COVID-19 pandemic than white people, Beyea said, echoing a national trend, despite Maine’s relatively small non-white population. “We wish the PPD and all Maine law enforcement would recognize and condemn the systemic racism that makes these killings so commonplace. Policies and protocols and training are important, but they won’t stop people from being killed until we address the root of the problem,” Beyea wrote. “It will take all of us acknowledging and fighting against racism to prevent the next tragic incident from happening here,” she said. Police training in recent years has evolved to acknowledge that racism and unintentional bias play a role in how everyone views others and makes decisions, including police officers, and anti-bias training is now part of Portland’s training regimen and is reinforced through rotating classes that all Maine police officers must complete annually to maintain their certification. « Previous Next » filed under:",0.0

Yet when I go to the grocery store, there are still maskless people going the wrong way in the now one-way aisles, creating traffic problems and exhaling their uncontained droplets for others to breathe. I find their obvious unconcern for my life infuriating. All over the country in the summertime, stores of all sorts have the signs posted, “no shirt, no shoes, no service.” And you know what? No half-naked, barefoot people are allowed in the stores! I fail to see why the stores that post signs that say “masks required” can’t put that sign next to the “no shirts, no shoes” and deny service to the maskless. Add masks: no shirt, no shoes, no mask, no service! Enforce it! Sue Shaw Penobscot Staying safe and healthy I was astounded by the selfishness displayed in several of the letters to the editor in the BDN on May 25. First, I am well aware and empathetic to the hardships being endured by everyone during the pandemic. Lost business and incomes create problems for everyone, for some more than others. I too desire for life to get back to something that passes for normal and miss seeing friends, going to church, and going on outings. But there are facts we all must understand. People are contagious and spreading the virus for several days before having any symptoms or having a positive test. We must consider everyone we see as a potential spreader. The way we can slow the virus, short of a vaccine that is many months away, is social distancing and masks. Folks believe their freedoms are abridged on a day when we honor the ultimate sacrifices to secure those freedoms? We are never free to yell fire in a crowded theater, dump toxic chemicals wherever we want, or drive 80 mph in town or 150 mph on the interstate. Why? Because these actions endanger others. So while we remember those who gave their all, I ask these people if they are prepared to give their all to COVID-19? The all of a loved one, or several loved ones? I am not, and they do not have the freedom to spread the virus and infect others! I believe the only way to be safe is to stay closed. Is staying closed difficult and a sacrifice? Yes! But it beats the alternative. May everyone stay safe and healthy. John Albertini Charleston Appalled by two-party failures As a citizen and investor, I am continually appalled at the two party menagerie that argues continually over spilled milk and whodunit rather addressing the problem (cleanup), i.e. healthcare, the budget, mediocre education and yes, COVID-19. Their latest fumble of the coronavirus pandemic merely underlines the basic incompetency of allowing politicians — generally trained as lawyers — to tackle problems that are the respective bailiwicks of economists, doctors, scientists, and engineers. But we are a nation dazzled by B.S. rather than enlightened by knowledge. Frederick Mendel Sherman What Trump shows us With COVID-19 still in full swing, there are daily reports and newsreels of crowds at beaches, in cities, and elsewhere with many people not wearing masks, social distancing, or making any effort to stem the spread of the virus. Some may be young and carefree, who have no thought of death, and others may in fact think they are immune. In most every case, they likely take their cue from President Donald Trump, who ignores advice from advisers and scientific experts who advocate taking precaution to arrest the spread of the virus. This is vanity, plain and simple, by a man who not only thinks he is so perfect, but also so healthy, that he must display his false machismo. Such an attitude shows an outrageous disregard for the people he supposedly represents. It shows a total lack of compassion, concern, and respect for the truth and for all those who have died from the horrible disease. In short, Donald Trump every day tells us that he does not care about us. Stephen Colhoun Addison We need to reopen as fast as possible Geoff Gratwick’s May 26 OpEd in the BDN is a good example of the arrogance and hypocrisy of many on the left. He apparently believes the state should remain locked down for as long as possible. He’s entitled to that opinion. However, he can’t rest after making his opinion evident — he has to essentially call anyone who disagrees with him “immoral” and “self-centered”, and say their actions are “blind, unthinking and profound in their selfishness.” If the left had demonstrated a better understanding of the virus and its effects than those of us who want reopening, perhaps he’d be justified. But the leftist mayor of New York originally urged residents to get out and go to movies and have fun. The leftist governor of New York initially required nursing homes to accept patients who were known to have the virus. How many thousands of New Yorkers died from those decisions? When we look back 10 years from now, it’s quite possible that we’ll realize the lockdown did more damage than the virus. The economy is suffering now, there are warnings that suicides and domestic violence have increased, and many jobs and businesses will never come back. I believe reopening as fast as possible is the best way to go. Lawrence E. Merrill Bangor A man of his word? With reference to the article on the front page of the BDN on May 18, “ LePage speaks from inside car during protest in Augusta” — I seem to recall that Mr. LePage said he was going to Florida and not coming back.

The protests started peacefully. But shortly after 11:30 p.m., gunfire erupted. It's not yet clear who did the shooting, though Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer said during a Friday morning press conference that the shots did not come from police. All shooting victims are ""stable and recovering,"" Fischer said. The mayor thanked the majority of protesters who were peaceful and he expressed sympathy for those mourning the loss of Taylor, who was shot and killed in her apartment on March 13 as part of a narcotics investigation. The audio of a 911 call made by Taylor's boyfriend, who was with her that night, was released earlier Thursday. The unrest in Louisville happened on the same night that protests escalated in Minneapolis, where demonstrators called for justice over the death of George Floyd. Fischer also spoke of the ""historical injustice"" felt by those in his city and throughout the country who are ""tired and sick of story after story of black lives ending at the hands of law enforcement."" ""We must find a way to stop this cycle of injustice,"" Fischer said before urging residents of Louisville for peace in future protests. ""The violence and demonstration and the destruction that we saw last night will not get us there. It will create more tragedies rather than prevent them,"" Fischer said. 'I don't know where the shots came from' Ryan Van Velzer, a reporter for WFPL in Louisville, described a chaotic scene in front of City Hall on Thursday. ""There were several gunshots and two people went down. I don't know where the shots came from,"" he reported. People in the crowd ran, Van Velzer reported, adding police were able set up a barrier and provide help to the victims. ""It looked like at least one man was shot in the abdomen. I saw blood,"" he said. ""Don't know what happened to the other person, but I saw them laying 5 or 10 feet away."" The station also reported that areas around the protest sustained damage by the end of the evening. ""Protesters damaged the statue of King Louis XVI outside Metro Hall and slashed vehicle tires,"" WFPL reported. ""Police fired tear gas and rubber bullets."" Louisville Metro Police Lt. Col. LaVita Chavous said at the Friday press briefing that officers fired tear gas into the crowd only after gunshots had been fired from within the crowd. The extent of the damage from the unrest is still being tallied, but Chavous said windows were broken and multiple shots were fired into buildings including a courthouse and the Louisville Metro Police Department headquarters. Two officers were treated at a local hospital. One arrest was made for disorderly conduct and failure to disperse. ""All off days for officers have been canceled as we ready to staff any additional situations that arise,"" Chavous said. She said there are no plans to bring in the National Guard, but it is possible other agencies outside of Louisville will be brought in to assist. There are more protests scheduled over the weekend, including one planned by Taylor's family in front of the mayor's office at Louisville's Metro Hall, WHAS, a local ABC affiliate, reports. The Louisville Courier-Journal reported that Louisville Councilwoman Keisha Dorsey, who watched as the streets filled with protesters, said that what happened was ""not a riot."" ""It's a revolt against a system in which people have felt oppressed,"" said Dorsey. ""What I'm seeing is people who are trying their best to do something with their hurt, their pain and their frustration."" Violence in Louisville took place despite calls from the Taylor family to keep protests peaceful. ""We are so grateful for everyone giving Bre a voice tonight, for saying her name, for demanding truth, for demanding justice and for demanding accountability,"" Taylor's sister Juniyah Palmer posted to Facebook on Thursday. She added: ""We demand change. We demand reform. But we do not need for our community to get hurt. We need for our community to get justice."" Latest in the Breonna Taylor case Police were executing a search warrant for at Taylor's apartment after midnight on March 13. The officers say they announced their presence, then forced their way into the apartment, WFPL's Amina Elahi reported Friday on NPR. ""By then, she and her boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, who was there with her that night were scared. And Kenneth Walker says he fired a warning shot at the police because he thought some intruder was breaking in,"" Elahi reported. ""The police fired back, more than 20 shots, and eight of them struck Breonna Taylor and killed her,"" she said. Earlier this week, Walker was released from custody. He had been charged with first-degree assault and attempting to murder a police officer, though Walker has maintained he thought the officers, who were executing a ""no knock"" warrant, were intruders. Last week, Fischer, the Louisville mayor, announced that an internal investigation into the matter had been handed over to Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron's office. A day after that announcement, on May 21, Louisville Metro Police Chief Steve Conrad said he plans to retire in June, as scrutiny over his department's handling of the Taylor case was drawing national attention. That same day, FBI Louisville announced it also is investigating the Taylor shooting. ""The FBI will collect all available facts and evidence and will ensure that the investigation is conducted in a fair, thorough and impartial manner, special agent in charge Robert Brown said in a statement.

Floyd, a black man from Minnesota, died while in police custody Monday, and his home state has since been embroiled in rioting. Earlier in the day, Portland Police Chief Frank Clark and officials in the department’s unions issued an open letter to the community regarding Floyd’s death — that they were waiting for “answers and justice.” The letter came before murder charges were filed against former Minnesota police officer Derek Chauvin, a white man filmed pinning Floyd’s neck to the ground with his knee. The letter also reassured people that departmental policies and procedures would prevent a similar tragedy in Maine’s largest city. But that didn’t keep protesters from gathering at Monument Square to voice their frustration. April, a black woman who wished only to be identified by her first name, says similar incidents could happen here. Joined by her family, she says she has seen police in Maine brush off racist incidents in the past. “I’ve had my tires slashed, I’ve been called the N-word while I’m taking care of these little children here,” she says. After assembling, protesters marched to City Hall before continuing on to police headquarters on Middle Street. There, student Loyde Vumpa says Floyd’s death part is of a deeper social issue. “I want people to know that racism isn’t getting worse, It’s just being filmed,” she says. Outside the police department, the group chanted and voiced solidarity with other protesters around the country before dispersing into the city.

It looks like you hate all white people. You should be ashamed of yourself, A man of your age. It’s people like you who drive people like me to vote for the MAN, Donald Trump. MAGA."" Such ugly messages – as that above received last week – are not uncommon in my inbox. Few, however, are as honest and as illustrative – linking racism and Donald Trump – of an America that, even at a time of economic collapse and pandemic, continues to be plagued by a contagion more persistent, more pernicious than the presence of COVID-19. An America that continues to be plagued by its original sin – racism. This past week, after Christian Cooper, a 57-year-old black birdwatcher asked a 41-year-old white dog-walker, Amy Cooper (no relation), to leash her dog in the Bramble, an area of New York’s Central Park where leashing is required, the fragile white woman exercising her implicit privilege and power – responded by calling the police saying ""an African American man in Central Park ... is recording me and threatened myself and my dog … Please send a cop! Immediately!"" In Minnesota this past week cops immediately responded to a non-violent allegation of forgery in Minneapolis. As a result, a black man, George Floyd, was killed after Derek Chauvin, a white Minneapolis police officer – in the presence of three other policemen – exercising his privilege and power –b unyieldingly pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck as he, handcuffed and prone on the asphalt, shouted he couldn’t breathe. ""Please, the knee in my neck, I can’t breathe, sir."" ""He should not have died,"" Minneapolis Mayor Frey said. ""What we saw was horrible, completely and utterly messed up. ... Whatever the investigation reveals, it does not change the simple truth that he should be with us this morning."" ""Being black in America should not be a death sentence,"" the mayor continued. ""When you hear someone calling for help, you are supposed to help. This officer failed in the most basic human sense."" Being black – being a person of color – in America shouldn’t be a death sentence – how many times must that sentiment be repeated, how many lives lost to prove the point? Indeed, how many lives may have been lost because there were no witnesses, no bystanders video recording deaths and lynchings. On Wednesday, as headlines lamented that more than 100,000 Americans had died of COVID-19 within approximately 100 days, it was also reported, less breathlessly, that with 20,000 deaths, African Americans are dying of the virus at three times the rate of white people. It was reported that COVID-19 is twice as deadly for black and Latinos than whites in New York City; that African Americans are 70% of all coronavirus cases in Chicago – which is 30% black. ""Please, the knee in my neck, I can’t breathe, sir."" Within America’s native communities the toll has been as deadly. The Navajo Nation has infection rates higher than any state: for example, in New Mexico, where Native Americans are 11% of the population they account for more than 50% of the COVID-19 cases. America’s minority communities and communities of color disproportionately suffer from COVID-19 because they have been oppressed – institutionally, medically, educationally, economically and politically disenfranchised – for generations, oppressed by a structural racism that has left their communities vulnerable and marginalized and less able to cope with the health impacts of a pandemic like COVID-19. ""Please, the knee in my neck, I can’t breathe, sir."" Their oppressors – including those like my critic whom I quote above – refuse to recognize that their privilege has – and continues to – dehumanize others, resulting in a system where black lives matter less than white lives. Their insistence in believing they have rights superior to individuals whom they believe are unworthy, untrustworthy, lazy, and ungrateful for the opportunities patronizingly offered to them by the dominant white class. It is within this racist paradigm that MAGA world thrives, a reality where, as Trump addressed the Veterans of Foreign Wars Convention in 2018: ""Just remember, what you are seeing and what you are reading is not what's happening."" A reality where anything that is not ""Trump’s"" truth is a lie. Trump’s reality – that which offends urban elites, immigrants, media and non-whites – is what mobilizes MAGA. Indeed, the more incompetent, incoherent and unhinged Trump is, the more loyal they are – and the more exploited they are. In the end they, too – unconsciously – are losing their breath, their lives, their jobs. They – unconsciously – within their resentments and grievances, are today betraying their own identities, families, and faiths; today losing their humanity. Sadly, MAGA world cannot see that in the pursuit of securing their dominance as oppressor they are dehumanizing themselves, that as they’re dehumanizing the Other they’re dehumanizing themselves. If one is to breathe we must all breathe together. ""As long as I fight,"" Paulo Freire offered in Pedagogy of the Oppressed, ""I am moved by hope; and if I fight with hope, then I can wait."" I fight with hope, and I can wait. Epilogue: ""A riot is the language of the unheard,"" Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., said in 1966 and Thursday night in Minneapolis and in other cities – after I had written the column above – many protesters who had taken to the streets to protest the murder of George Floyd by police officers in full view of a shocked public turned to rioting and looting – in defiance of their oppressors – to demonstrate their opposition to a legal system that systematically fails to defend them. Fails to defend Trayvone Martin, Eric Garner, Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, and George Floyd. Fails to listen to the unheard. ""Please, the knee in my neck, I can’t breathe, sir.""

Stafford said police were able to get inside and stop it before it spread. However, in at least one instance, Stafford said they were not able to respond to car fires burning along Park Avenue and Marietta Street extremely close to a hotel, but they weren't able to get there because of a hostile crowd. Stafford said APD used tear gas to disperse the crowd, but they still were not able to put out the fires. ""We had to let them burn,"" Stafford said, who added that their biggest concern is that one of those hotels or buildings would catch fire and crews wouldn't be able to get to. Safety, tonight, is a ""big deal,"" Stafford said. ""At this point, they really don't care who you are,"" he added, saying crews were attacked with rocks and other objects. Stafford said they are now trying to coordinate with police for protection and eliminate any threats. ""If we can get to these fires, we will extinguish them,"" he said. ""We can't protect ourselves with rocks and put a fire out at the same time."" 10:28 p.m. - Pastor of Ebenezer Baptist Church Rev.

Like you, I am hurting. But I plead with us all to maintain the discipline of peaceful protest. To do otherwise is to put one more weapon in the hands of those who would discredit our protests and dismiss our rightful complaints. Atlanta, the hometown of Martin Luther King Jr., knows the power of nonviolent protest. We must stand in love even as we stand up for justice. It is the more excellent way."" 10:21 p.m. - Police confirm there has been looting, and that the College Football Hall of Fame was one of the places targeted.

Upon returning to Centennial Olympic Park, the majority of protestors entered into the park while a portion walked south on Centennial Olympic Park Drive where they surrounded an officer inside his patrol vehicle. Additional officers arrived and began to push protestors back away from the vehicle, which led to a number of scuffles between police and protestors and at least three arrests. One officer was pushed to the ground and sustained minor injuries. It does appear pepper spray was utilized several times during the confrontation.

1620632821,2020-05-29 19:39:59,Biden ally sees Klobuchar as less likely Biden running mate,https://www.fosters.com/ZZ/news/20200529/biden-ally-sees-klobuchar-as-less-likely-biden-running-mate?rssfeed=true,en,True,,661135,Sanford News,http://www.fosters.com/apps/pbcs.dll/section?category=SANNEWS,"WASHINGTON (AP) "" Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar seems a less likely choice to become Joe Biden's running mate on his presidential ticket following this week's death of a black man in police custody in Minneapolis, a key ally of the former vice president said. Rep. James Clyburn, D-S.C., told reporters on Friday that while he believes Klobuchar is 'absolutely' qualified to be vice president, 'This is very tough timing for her.' Klobuchar was a prosecutor years ago in the county that includes Minneapolis. During that period, more than two dozen people "" mostly minorities "" died during encounters with police. Following customary practice at the time, she sent the cases to grand juries, which brought no criminal charges against any of the officers involved. Clyburn, who called his view a 'gut feeling,' played a pivotal role in helping Biden become the Democratic Party's all-but-certain presidential nominee. Clyburn is the No. 3 House Democratic leader and Congress' highest-ranking black lawmaker. 'So often in politics, timing really dictates things. Barack Obama I don't think could have gotten elected four years before he got elected,"" Clyburn said of the former president during a conference call. 'And I don't know whether he could get elected today.' Clyburn helped revive Biden's badly flagging presidential campaign earlier this year, lifting him to a decisive win in a South Carolina primary in which large numbers of voters were black. That fueled a Biden run to a string of victories in other state contests that resulted in his becoming the party's presumptive nominee. On MSNBC, Biden said the tensions in Minnesota following the death of George Floyd have 'nothing to do with my running mate.' Pressed on whether Floyd's killing increases pressure to place an African American woman on his ticket, Biden said he's talked about putting women of color on the Supreme Court and in his Cabinet. 'And I also already said that there are women of color under consideration,"" he said. Klobuchar did not respond to a request Friday by The Associated Press for an interview. On CNN, she sidestepped a question about her vice presidential prospects. 'He's going to make the best decision on whoever he wants to govern with,' she said of Biden. Before being elected to the Senate in 2006, Klobuchar, who is white, spent eight years as prosecutor for Minnesota's largest county. Most of the more than two dozen people who died during police encounters in her tenure were people of color, according to data compiled by Communities United Against Police Brutality and news articles reviewed by the AP. An officer involved in one of those past fatal incidents was Derek Chauvin, who was arrested and charged Friday in this week's death of Floyd. A video showing Floyd complaining that he could not breathe as Chauvin kneeled on his neck has helped spark unrest in cities around the country. Chauvin was among six officers who fired on and killed a man in 2006 who reportedly stabbed two people and then aimed a shotgun at police. Chauvin's 2006 case went to the grand jury after Klobuchar was elected to the Senate and had left the county attorney's office. Mike Freeman, Klobuchar's successor as prosecutor, made 'all prosecutorial decisions"" about Chauvin, according to a Freeman statement that Klobuchar's office provided Saturday. Klobuchar told MSNBC that she now believes the practice of asking a grand jury to decide whether to charge officers was wrong. Klobuchar and 27 other Democratic senators wrote Friday to the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division, asking it to investigate 'patterns and practices of racially discriminatory and violent policing' by the Minneapolis police. ___ AP reporters Sara Burnett in Chicago and Will Weissert in Washington contributed to this report.",0.0

In Phoenix, Denver, Las Vegas, Los Angeles and beyond, thousands of protesters carried signs that said: “He said I can’t breathe. Justice for George.” They chanted ”“No justice, no peace” and “Say his name. George Floyd.” After hours of peaceful protest in downtown Atlanta, some demonstrators suddenly turned violent, smashing police cars, setting one on fire, spray-painting the iconic logo sign at CNN headquarters, and breaking into a restaurant. The crowd pelted officers with bottles, chanting “Quit your jobs.” At least three officers were hurt and there were multiple arrests, Atlanta police spokesman Carlos Campos said. Campos said protesters shot BB guns at officers and threw bricks, bottles and knives at them. People watched the scene from rooftops, some laughing as skirmishes broke out. Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms passionately addressed the protesters at a news conference: “This is not a protest. This is not in the spirit of Martin Luther King Jr.” Related Hundreds take to Portland streets to protest Minneapolis police killing “You are disgracing our city,” she told protesters. “You are disgracing the life of George Floyd and every other person who has been killed in this country. We are better than this. We are better than this as a city. We are better than this as a country. Go home, go home.” Bottoms was flanked by rappers T.I. and Killer Mike, as well as King’s daughter, Bernice King. Killer Mike cried as he spoke. “We have to be better than this moment. We have to be better than burning down our own homes. Because if we lose Atlanta what have we got?” he said. After Mayor Bottoms appealed for calm, the violence continued. More cars were set on fire, a Starbucks was smashed up, the windows of the College Football Hall of Fame were broken, and the iconic Omni Hotel was vandalized. Protesters gathered outside the White House, with President Donald Trump inside, and some tried to push through barriers set up by the U.S. Secret Service along Pennsylvania Avenue. In Minneapolis, a curfew did little to stop protesters and others from gathering in several areas of the city, including the battered Lake Street neighborhood where a police precinct was burned the night before. There were scattered small fires and some stores in a strip mall were being broken into near the city’s 5th Precinct. An initially peaceful demonstration in New York City spiraled into chaos as night fell, as protesters skirmished with officers, destroyed police vehicles and set fires. In Brooklyn, activists who had marched from Manhattan chanted insults at officers lined up outside the Barclays Center and pelted them with water bottles. Police sprayed an eye-irritating chemical into the largely diverse crowd multiple times, then cleared the plaza. Video posted to social media showed officers using batons and shoving protesters down as they took people into custody and cleared streets. Demonstrators rocked a police van, set it ablaze, then scrawled graffiti across its charred hulk and set it on fire a second time as officers retreated from the area. Blocks away, protesters used a club to batter another police vehicle. Numerous people were arrested and police brought in buses to carry off those they arrested. “We have a long night ahead of us in Brooklyn,” Mayor Bill de Blasio tweeted. “Our sole focus is deescalating this situation and getting people home safe. There will be a full review of what happened tonight. We don’t ever want to see another night like this.” The police department said numerous officers were injured, including one who had a tooth knocked out. The names of black people killed by police, including Floyd and Eric Garner, who died on Staten Island in 2014, were on signs carried by those in the crowd, and in their chants. “It’s my duty to be out here,” said Brianna Petrisko, among those at Foley Square in lower Manhattan, where most were wearing masks amid the coronavirus pandemic. “Our country has a sickness. We have to be out here. This is the only way we’re going to be heard.” In Houston, where George Floyd grew up, several thousand people rallied in front of City Hall. Among them was 19-year-old Jimmy Ohaz, who came from the nearby city of Richmond, Texas. “My question is how many more, how many more? I just want to live in a future where we all live in harmony and we’re not oppressed.” Tensions rose in several West Coast cities as night fell. About 1,000 protesters gathered in Oakland at a demonstration billed on social media as a rally to “F(asterisk)(asterisk)(asterisk) the police,” and some windows were smashed. Demonstrators shut down a freeway in Los Angeles amid isolated scuffles with police that ended in a few protesters detained and one officer receiving medical treatment, police said. An LAPD vehicle had its windows smashed, and CNN reported that someone wrote “killer” on a patrol car. Protesters repeatedly clashed with police in the Silicon Valley city of San Jose, said Mayor Sam Liccardo, and police responded with flash-bang grenades and rubber bullets. One officer was being treated at a hospital for an injury that was not life-threatening, he and police officials said. Liccardo said his own officers shared the community’s outrage over Floyd’s in-custody death. “It was a horrible injustice. I’d venture to guess that every police officer out there feels much of the same anger about what happened in Minneapolis,” he told The Associated Press. Thirty miles to the west, Santa Cruz police chief Andrew G. Mills said in a statement that the actions by Minneapolis officers in Floyd’s death “are the antithesis of what we view as good policing.” Send questions/comments to the editors. « Previous Next »",0.0
1621049348,2020-05-30 13:17:28,National Guard summoned to aid cities amid police clashes,https://www.sunjournal.com/2020/05/30/national-guard-summoned-to-aid-cities-amid-police-clashes/,en,False,,68001,sunjournal.com,http://www.sunjournal.com/#spider,"MINNEAPOLIS — Tense protests over the death of George Floyd and other police killings of black people grew Saturday from New York to Tulsa to Los Angeles, with police cars set ablaze and reports of injuries mounting on all sides as the country convulsed through another night of unrest after months of coronavirus lockdowns. The protests, which began in Minneapolis following Floyd’s death Monday after a police officer pressed a knee on his neck until he stopped breathing, have left parts of the city a grid of broken windows, burned-out buildings and ransacked stores. The unrest has since become a national phenomenon as protesters decry years of deaths at police hands. Tens of thousands of people were in the streets across the country, many of them not wearing masks or observing social distancing, raising concerns among health experts about the potential for spreading the coronavirus pandemic at a time when much of the country is in the process of reopening society and the economy. Few corners of America were untouched, from protesters setting fires inside Reno’s city hall, to police launching tear gas at rock-throwing demonstrators in Fargo, North Dakota, to shattered windows at police headquarters in Richmond, Virginia. After a tumultuous Friday night, racially diverse crowds took to the streets again for mostly peaceful demonstrations in dozens of cities from coast to coast. The previous day’s protests also started calmly, but many descended into violence later in the day. • In Indianapolis, police were investigating “multiple shootings” downtown, including one that left a person dead, amid the protests. Police gave few details but said no officers were involved. • In Washington, the D.C. National Guard was called in as hundreds converged on the mall and pockets of violence erupted during a second straight night of protests. Outside the White House, crowds chanted, taunted Secret Service agents and at times pushed against security barriers, and police used pepper spray. President Donald Trump, who spent much of Saturday in Florida for the SpaceX rocket launch, landed on the lawn in the presidential helicopter at dusk and went inside without speaking to journalists. • In Philadelphia, at least 13 officers were injured when peaceful protests turned violent and at least four police vehicles were set on fire. Other fires were set throughout downtown. • In the Greenwood District of Tulsa, Oklahoma, the site of a 1921 massacre of black people that left as many as 300 dead and the city’s thriving black district in ruins, protesters blocked intersections and chanted the name of Terence Crutcher, a black man killed by a police officer in 2016. • In Seattle, police fired tear gas and stun grenades to try to disperse black-clad crowds that smashed downtown shopfronts, stole merchandise and tossed mannequins onto the street. • In Los Angeles, protesters chanted “Black Lives Matter,” some within inches of the face shields of officers. Police used batons to move the crowd back and fired rubber bullets. One man used a skateboard to try to break a police SUV’s windshield. A spray-painted police car burned in the street. • And in New York City, dangerous confrontations flared repeatedly as officers made arrests and cleared streets. A video showed two NYPD cruisers lurching into a crowd of demonstrators who were pushing a barricade against one of them and pelting it with objects, knocking several people to the ground. It was unclear if anyone was hurt. “Our country has a sickness. We have to be out here,” said Brianna Petrisko, among those at lower Manhattan’s Foley Square, where most were wearing masks amid the coronavirus pandemic. “This is the only way we’re going to be heard.” Back in Minneapolis, the city where the protests began, 29-year-old Sam Allkija said the damage seen in recent days reflects longstanding frustration and rage in the black community. “I don’t condone them,” he said. “But you have to look deeper into why these riots are happening.” Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, who said local forces had been overmatched Friday, fully mobilized the state’s National Guard and promised a massive show of force. The Guard announced Saturday it had more than 4,000 members responding to Minneapolis and would quickly have nearly 11,000. “The situation in Minneapolis is no longer in any way about the murder of George Floyd,” Walz said. “It is about attacking civil society, instilling fear and disrupting our great cities.” Soon after the city’s 8 p.m. curfew went into force, lines of police cars and officers in riot gear moved in to confront protesters, firing tear gas to push away throngs of people milling around the city’s 5th police precinct station. The tougher tactics came after city and state leaders were criticized for not forcefully enough confronting days of violent and damaging protests that included protesters burning down a police station shortly after officers abandoned it. Related Hundreds take to Portland streets to protest Minneapolis police killing Trump appeared to cheer on the tougher tactics Saturday night, commending the Guard deployment in Minneapolis, declaring “No games!” and saying police in New York City “must be allowed to do their job!” Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden condemned the violence as he continued to express common cause with those demonstrating after Floyd’s death. “The act of protesting should never be allowed to overshadow the reason we protest,” Biden said in a statement Saturday night. Overnight curfews were imposed in more than a dozen major cities nationwide, ranging from 6 p.m. in parts of South Carolina to 10 p.m. around Ohio. People were also told to be off the streets of Atlanta, Denver, Los Angeles, Seattle and Minneapolis — where thousands had ignored the same order Friday night. More than 1,300 people have been arrested in 16 cities since Thursday, with more than 500 of those happening in Los Angeles on Friday. The unrest comes at a time when most Americans have spent months inside over concerns surrounding the coronavirus, which the president has called an “invisible enemy.” The events of the last 72 hours, seen live on national television, have shown the opposite: a sudden pivot to crowds, screaming protesters and burning buildings, a stark contrast to the empty streets of recent months. “Quite frankly I’m ready to just lock people up,” Atlanta Police Chief Erika Shields said at a news conference. Demonstrations there turned violent Friday, and police were arresting protesters Saturday on blocked-off downtown streets. “Yes, you caught us off balance once.

The protests, which began in Minneapolis following Floyd’s death Monday after a police officer pressed a knee on his neck until he stopped breathing, have left parts of the city a grid of broken windows, burned-out buildings and ransacked stores. The unrest has since become a national phenomenon as protesters decry years of deaths at police hands. Tens of thousands of people were in the streets across the country, many of them not wearing masks or observing social distancing, raising concerns among health experts about the potential for spreading the coronavirus pandemic at a time when much of the country is in the process of reopening society and the economy. Few corners of America were untouched, from protesters setting fires inside Reno’s city hall, to police launching tear gas at rock-throwing demonstrators in Fargo, North Dakota, to shattered windows at police headquarters in Richmond, Virginia. After a tumultuous Friday night, racially diverse crowds took to the streets again for mostly peaceful demonstrations in dozens of cities from coast to coast. The previous day’s protests also started calmly, but many descended into violence later in the day. • In Indianapolis, police were investigating “multiple shootings” downtown, including one that left a person dead, amid the protests. Police gave few details but said no officers were involved. • In Washington, the D.C. National Guard was called in as hundreds converged on the mall and pockets of violence erupted during a second straight night of protests. Outside the White House, crowds chanted, taunted Secret Service agents and at times pushed against security barriers, and police used pepper spray. President Donald Trump, who spent much of Saturday in Florida for the SpaceX rocket launch, landed on the lawn in the presidential helicopter at dusk and went inside without speaking to journalists. • In Philadelphia, at least 13 officers were injured when peaceful protests turned violent and at least four police vehicles were set on fire. Other fires were set throughout downtown. • In the Greenwood District of Tulsa, Oklahoma, the site of a 1921 massacre of black people that left as many as 300 dead and the city’s thriving black district in ruins, protesters blocked intersections and chanted the name of Terence Crutcher, a black man killed by a police officer in 2016. • In Seattle, police fired tear gas and stun grenades to try to disperse black-clad crowds that smashed downtown shopfronts, stole merchandise and tossed mannequins onto the street. • In Los Angeles, protesters chanted “Black Lives Matter,” some within inches of the face shields of officers. Police used batons to move the crowd back and fired rubber bullets. One man used a skateboard to try to break a police SUV’s windshield. A spray-painted police car burned in the street. • And in New York City, dangerous confrontations flared repeatedly as officers made arrests and cleared streets. A video showed two NYPD cruisers lurching into a crowd of demonstrators who were pushing a barricade against one of them and pelting it with objects, knocking several people to the ground. It was unclear if anyone was hurt. “Our country has a sickness. We have to be out here,” said Brianna Petrisko, among those at lower Manhattan’s Foley Square, where most were wearing masks amid the coronavirus pandemic. “This is the only way we’re going to be heard.” Back in Minneapolis, the city where the protests began, 29-year-old Sam Allkija said the damage seen in recent days reflects longstanding frustration and rage in the black community. “I don’t condone them,” he said. “But you have to look deeper into why these riots are happening.” Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, who said local forces had been overmatched Friday, fully mobilized the state’s National Guard and promised a massive show of force. The Guard announced Saturday it had more than 4,000 members responding to Minneapolis and would quickly have nearly 11,000. “The situation in Minneapolis is no longer in any way about the murder of George Floyd,” Walz said. “It is about attacking civil society, instilling fear and disrupting our great cities.” Soon after the city’s 8 p.m. curfew went into force, lines of police cars and officers in riot gear moved in to confront protesters, firing tear gas to push away throngs of people milling around the city’s 5th police precinct station. The tougher tactics came after city and state leaders were criticized for not forcefully enough confronting days of violent and damaging protests that included protesters burning down a police station shortly after officers abandoned it. Related Hundreds take to Portland streets to protest Minneapolis police killing Trump appeared to cheer on the tougher tactics Saturday night, commending the Guard deployment in Minneapolis, declaring “No games!” and saying police in New York City “must be allowed to do their job!” Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden condemned the violence as he continued to express common cause with those demonstrating after Floyd’s death. “The act of protesting should never be allowed to overshadow the reason we protest,” Biden said in a statement Saturday night. Overnight curfews were imposed in more than a dozen major cities nationwide, ranging from 6 p.m. in parts of South Carolina to 10 p.m. around Ohio. People were also told to be off the streets of Atlanta, Denver, Los Angeles, Seattle and Minneapolis — where thousands had ignored the same order Friday night. More than 1,300 people have been arrested in 16 cities since Thursday, with more than 500 of those happening in Los Angeles on Friday. The unrest comes at a time when most Americans have spent months inside over concerns surrounding the coronavirus, which the president has called an “invisible enemy.” The events of the last 72 hours, seen live on national television, have shown the opposite: a sudden pivot to crowds, screaming protesters and burning buildings, a stark contrast to the empty streets of recent months. “Quite frankly I’m ready to just lock people up,” Atlanta Police Chief Erika Shields said at a news conference. Demonstrations there turned violent Friday, and police were arresting protesters Saturday on blocked-off downtown streets. “Yes, you caught us off balance once.

1621064100,2020-05-30 14:06:16,Louisville PD apologizes for targeting news crew at protest,https://www.sunjournal.com/2020/05/30/louisville-pd-apologizes-for-targeting-news-crew-at-protest/,en,False,,68001,sunjournal.com,http://www.sunjournal.com/#spider,"LOUISVILLE, Ky. — Kentucky’s governor on Saturday called in the National Guard to “help keep the peace” in Louisville after a second night of protests sparked by the police shooting of a black woman led to widespread damage. Gov. Andy Beshear said he didn’t want to silence protesters but decided to activate the Guard to quell the actions of “outside groups” that are “trying to create violence.” His action came after the unrest Friday night spread through parts of downtown Louisville, resulting in windows being shattered and small fires being set. Police said six people were arrested during Friday’s protest, which began peacefully but grew more destructive as the night went on. During the protests, a police officer was seen on camera firing what appeared to be pepper balls at a news crew during a live television broadcast. A crew from WAVE-TV was on air when reporter Kaitlin Rust was heard yelling off-camera: “I’ve been shot! I’ve been shot!” Video shows a police officer aiming directly at the camera crew, as Rust describes the projectiles as “pepper bullets.” A clip of the WAVE-TV broadcast posted to Twitter amassed more than 8 million views in less than six hours, and was retweeted more than 50,000 times, including by other journalists and rapper Ice-T. Louisville Police spokeswoman Jesse Halladay apologized for the incident. Halladay said police would review the video and “if we need to do any investigation for discipline, we will do that.” Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer, standing in front of a business with broken windows Saturday morning, imposed a dusk-to-dawn curfew in Kentucky’s largest city. “The tone clearly changed last night. The number of people on our street clearly changed last night, as well,” Fischer said. “This turned from being a peaceful protest into violence and terrorism and looting on the streets of our city.” Several downtown businesses had windows shattered and graffiti sprayed on walls. About 350 National Guard members will be sent to Louisville to assist police Saturday afternoon. Louisville’s protests followed the release of a 911 call by shooting victim Breonna Taylor’s boyfriend made March 13, moments after the 26-year-old EMT was shot eight times by narcotics detectives who knocked down her front door. No drugs were found in her home. Taylor’s death has captured national headlines alongside the killings of Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia in February and George Floyd, the black man who died after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck for several minutes as he pleaded for air. Protesters carried signs calling for justice for Taylor and Floyd, whose death has touched off protests across the country this week. The use of nonlethal force on the WAVE-TV crew happened the same day CNN employees were arrested live on air while covering protests in Minnesota. Gunfire erupted during earlier Louisville protests on Thursday night, wounding seven people. Beshear, a Democrat, has pledged to listen to the frustrations of protesters and to “do everything I can to help moving forward.” But he said he wants to make sure that “we are all safe” in deciding to call in guardsmen to reinforce Louisville police. “The demonstrations in Louisville have all started peacefully, but what we have seen, especially last night, and what our intelligence says is going to happen, are outside groups moving in, trying to create violence to harm everybody who is on those streets,” Beshear said Saturday. “We cannot let Breonna’s legacy be marred by violence, and we can’t let our streets turn violent.” « Previous Next »",0.0

He worked with the city’s booming business community and the City Council. He reached out to minority neighborhoods and advocated for affordable housing. He implemented stricter disciplinary measures against police who violated the city’s body camera policy. When George Floyd, a handcuffed black man, died Monday after a white police officer pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes and ignored his “I can’t breathe” pleas, Frey quickly expressed outrage and called for charges against the officer. Four officers were fired the next day, and on Friday, Officer Derek Chauvin was charged in Floyd’s death. But Frey’s leadership is being questioned after police failed to quell three nights of looting, rioting and fires that followed Floyd’s death. Frey, who pleaded for calm, also approved the decision to abandon the city’s 3rd Precinct station on Thursday night, surrendering it to protesters who set fire to the building. The night the station burned, Frey appeared at an early-morning news conference after hours of criticism on social media for a police response that didn’t confront the violence despite the activation of the National Guard. As he began talking, one reporter snapped, “What’s the plan here?” Frey struggled to answer, and the next morning, Gov. Tim Walz — like Frey, a Democrat — criticized the “abject failure” of the city’s response and said the state had taken control. President Donald Trump took to Twitter to call Frey a “very weak Radical Left Mayor” and threatened to get involved. By early Saturday morning, it was Walz who found himself struggling with the enormity of the challenge, conceding that he didn’t have enough people to cope with the protests and moving to mobilize another 1,000 Guard members. Walz also took pains to praise Frey, who appeared alongside him after another night of unrest. Some wonder whether Frey’s approach to the crisis might damage his chances for reelection next year. The 38-year-old former lawyer, community organizer and one-term City Council member took office in 2018 after defeating Betsy Hodges, whose time as mayor was marred by two high-profile police shootings. The 2015 shooting of 24-year-old black resident Jamar Clark after a scuffle with two white police officers set off weeks of protests; neither officer was charged. The 2017 shooting of unarmed Australia native Justine Ruszczyk Damond, who had called 911 to report a possible sexual assault behind her house, provoked an international outcry. The black officer in that case was convicted of third-degree murder and is serving a 12 1/2 year term. Frey campaigned partly on a promise to add police officers. But a City Council committee this spring voted against applying for a federal grant to hire 10 new officers for traffic enforcement, with one member saying he worried it would exacerbate racial disparities in vehicle stops. Community activist Mel Reeves, who said he has led rallies to protest Floyd’s killing, refused to discuss the mayor’s response except to say that Frey had been “put in a difficult position.” He said the black community doesn’t trust police and prosecutors to do the right thing. “The mayor is new, and he said all the right things,” Reeves said. “This is not about the mayor; it’s about the police department.” The day after the 3rd Precinct fire, University of Minnesota political science professor Larry Jacobs said Frey was “out of his depth” and “clearly unable to understand what he has to do to restore order while also creating the kind of healing that has to happen in Minneapolis.” He said abandoning the police station “sent a powerful message” that the city was not in control. “There needs to be another message: ‘Here is the line and order will be maintained,’” said Jacobs. “You’ve got businesses that are just shocked without words to see property going up in flames, often with no police intervention at all. You have the black community (that has) heard his words but does not believe them. “He worked really hard at those relationships and they appear to be in tatters. And I think a lot of residents are unnerved by the violence and the chaos.” Jonathan Weinhagen, president and CEO of the Minneapolis Regional Chamber, said the mayor still has his support, and that many businesses damaged by the violent protests, including those owned by minorities and immigrants, want to rebuild. “There is a lot of fear right now. If your store has been hit, you feel violated,” said Weinhagen, adding that some businesses already were suffering because of the coronavirus restrictions. “They were just beginning to see some light and this hit.” But he believes the mayor is “leading with his values” and getting a lot of things right, including requesting the Guard assistance and implementing a curfew Friday and Saturday nights. Jacobs, the political scientist, said Frey has been energetic, upbeat and dynamic, effectively leading the fast-growing city. But his inexperience with crisis management has shown. “Until about a week ago, he looked to be on glide path to reelection, and within a week, his mayorship looks like it’s crumbled,” Jacobs said.

The shooting occurred about 11:30 p.m. Friday near Detroit’s Greektown entertainment district as officers were confronted with dozens of protesters, said Sgt. Nicole Kirkwood, a police spokeswoman. She said an officer wasn’t involved in the shooting. A police report released Saturday said the shooting victim, a 21-year-old man, was sitting in the driver’s seat of a silver Dodge Caliber in a parking lot with two other male occupants when an unknown person fired shots into the vehicle and then fled on foot. Police earlier said that based on preliminary information, the shooting suspect had pulled up in a Dodge Durango and fired shots into a crowd. Kirkwood said the victim was pronounced dead at a hospital and that police were still investigating the circumstances surrounding the shooting. Police made more than 60 arrests during Friday’s protest. The majority of those arrested live in Detroit’s suburbs and not the city itself, Kirkwood said. “We know that the individuals from outside the city of Detroit who converged at the protest location don’t represent this city,” Police Chief James Craig told reporters Friday evening. The demonstration began earlier in the day and was peaceful as protesters marched by Detroit Police Headquarters. As evening wore on, some in the crowd became belligerent and a police commander was struck with a rock Friday evening and hospitalized. Officers, many in riot gear, confronted the demonstrators and formed lines across streets during the demonstration, but by midnight, the crowd had thinned considerably as police shot canisters of gas toward the protesters. The violence in Detroit and many other cities was sparked by anger over over Floyd’s death in Minneapolis on Monday, which was captured on cellphone video. It led to the firing Tuesday of the four police officers who were arresting Floyd on for suspicion of passing a counterfeit bill and to third-degree murder and manslaughter charges being filed Friday against the officer who used his knee to pin Floyd down by his neck for more than eight minutes, even as Floyd pleaded for air and went limp. Wayne County Prosecutor Kym Worthy said Saturday in a statement that “an overwhelming number of people were engaged in peaceful protest” during Friday’s protests over Floyd’s death — a death which she said “has profoundly affected our nation.” Worthy said that while peaceful protests over Floyd’s death are “absolutely warranted,” acts of violence are not. And she urged protesters to engage in “safe, peaceful and civil protest of his murder.” “The point of protesting what happened to Mr. Floyd can be lost when violence becomes the narrative of the protest,” she said. « Previous Next »",0.0

The identities of the officers were not released and there was no word on the condition of the wounded officer. The officers protect federal court houses as part of their regular duties. The shooting happened less than a half-mile from the Oakland Police headquarters where demonstrators gathered to protest the police killing of George Floyd in Minnesota. Some demonstrators smashed windows, vandalized stores stopped traffic on a freeway and set fires. Police said several officers were struck by objects and responded by firing tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse the crowd. The federal building’s glass doors were smashed and the front entrance was sprayed with anti-police graffiti. « Previous Next »",0.0

The protests, which began in Minneapolis following Floyd’s death Monday after a police officer pressed a knee on his neck until he stopped breathing, have left parts of the city a grid of broken windows, burned-out buildings and ransacked stores. The unrest has since become a national phenomenon as protesters decry years of deaths at police hands. Tens of thousands of people were in the streets across the country, many of them not wearing masks or observing social distancing, raising concerns among health experts about the potential for spreading the coronavirus pandemic at a time when much of the country is in the process of reopening society and the economy. Few corners of America were untouched, from protesters setting fires inside Reno’s city hall, to police launching tear gas at rock-throwing demonstrators in Fargo, North Dakota, to shattered windows at police headquarters in Richmond, Virginia. After a tumultuous Friday night, racially diverse crowds took to the streets again for mostly peaceful demonstrations in dozens of cities from coast to coast. The previous day’s protests also started calmly, but many descended into violence later in the day. • In Indianapolis, police were investigating “multiple shootings” downtown, including one that left a person dead, amid the protests. Police gave few details but said no officers were involved. • In Washington, the D.C. National Guard was called in as hundreds converged on the mall and pockets of violence erupted during a second straight night of protests. Outside the White House, crowds chanted, taunted Secret Service agents and at times pushed against security barriers, and police used pepper spray. President Donald Trump, who spent much of Saturday in Florida for the SpaceX rocket launch, landed on the lawn in the presidential helicopter at dusk and went inside without speaking to journalists. • In Philadelphia, at least 13 officers were injured when peaceful protests turned violent and at least four police vehicles were set on fire. Other fires were set throughout downtown. • In the Greenwood District of Tulsa, Oklahoma, the site of a 1921 massacre of black people that left as many as 300 dead and the city’s thriving black district in ruins, protesters blocked intersections and chanted the name of Terence Crutcher, a black man killed by a police officer in 2016. • In Seattle, police fired tear gas and stun grenades to try to disperse black-clad crowds that smashed downtown shopfronts, stole merchandise and tossed mannequins onto the street. • In Los Angeles, protesters chanted “Black Lives Matter,” some within inches of the face shields of officers. Police used batons to move the crowd back and fired rubber bullets. One man used a skateboard to try to break a police SUV’s windshield. A spray-painted police car burned in the street. • And in New York City, dangerous confrontations flared repeatedly as officers made arrests and cleared streets. A video showed two NYPD cruisers lurching into a crowd of demonstrators who were pushing a barricade against one of them and pelting it with objects, knocking several people to the ground. It was unclear if anyone was hurt. “Our country has a sickness. We have to be out here,” said Brianna Petrisko, among those at lower Manhattan’s Foley Square, where most were wearing masks amid the coronavirus pandemic. “This is the only way we’re going to be heard.” Back in Minneapolis, the city where the protests began, 29-year-old Sam Allkija said the damage seen in recent days reflects longstanding frustration and rage in the black community. “I don’t condone them,” he said. “But you have to look deeper into why these riots are happening.” Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, who said local forces had been overmatched Friday, fully mobilized the state’s National Guard and promised a massive show of force. The Guard announced Saturday it had more than 4,000 members responding to Minneapolis and would quickly have nearly 11,000. “The situation in Minneapolis is no longer in any way about the murder of George Floyd,” Walz said. “It is about attacking civil society, instilling fear and disrupting our great cities.” Soon after the city’s 8 p.m. curfew went into force, lines of police cars and officers in riot gear moved in to confront protesters, firing tear gas to push away throngs of people milling around the city’s 5th police precinct station. The tougher tactics came after city and state leaders were criticized for not forcefully enough confronting days of violent and damaging protests that included protesters burning down a police station shortly after officers abandoned it. Related Hundreds take to Portland streets to protest Minneapolis police killing Trump appeared to cheer on the tougher tactics Saturday night, commending the Guard deployment in Minneapolis, declaring “No games!” and saying police in New York City “must be allowed to do their job!” Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden condemned the violence as he continued to express common cause with those demonstrating after Floyd’s death. “The act of protesting should never be allowed to overshadow the reason we protest,” Biden said in a statement Saturday night. Overnight curfews were imposed in more than a dozen major cities nationwide, ranging from 6 p.m. in parts of South Carolina to 10 p.m. around Ohio. People were also told to be off the streets of Atlanta, Denver, Los Angeles, Seattle and Minneapolis — where thousands had ignored the same order Friday night. More than 1,300 people have been arrested in 16 cities since Thursday, with more than 500 of those happening in Los Angeles on Friday. The unrest comes at a time when most Americans have spent months inside over concerns surrounding the coronavirus, which the president has called an “invisible enemy.” The events of the last 72 hours, seen live on national television, have shown the opposite: a sudden pivot to crowds, screaming protesters and burning buildings, a stark contrast to the empty streets of recent months. “Quite frankly I’m ready to just lock people up,” Atlanta Police Chief Erika Shields said at a news conference. Demonstrations there turned violent Friday, and police were arresting protesters Saturday on blocked-off downtown streets. “Yes, you caught us off balance once. It’s not going to happen twice.” This week’s unrest recalled the riots in Los Angeles nearly 30 years ago after the acquittal of the white police officers who beat Rodney King, a black motorist who had led them on a high-speed chase. The protests of Floyd’s killing have gripped many more cities, but the losses in Minneapolis have yet to approach the staggering totals Los Angeles saw during five days of rioting in 1992, when more than 60 people died, 2,000-plus were injured and thousands arrested, with property damage topping $1 billion. Related Secret Service clashes with crowds at White House Many protesters spoke of frustration that Floyd’s death was one more in a litany. It came in the wake of the killing in Georgia of Ahmaud Arbery, a black man who was shot dead after being pursued by two white men while running in their neighborhood, and in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic that has thrown millions out of work, killed more than 100,000 people in the U.S. and disproportionately affected black people. The officer who held his knee to Floyd’s neck as he begged for air was arrested Friday and charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. But many protesters are demanding the arrests of the three other officers involved. Leaders in many affected cities have voiced outrage over Floyd’s killing and expressed sympathy for protesters’ concerns. But as the unrest intensified, they spoke of a desperate need to protect their cities and said they would call in reinforcements, despite concerns that could lead to more heavy-handed tactics. Minnesota has steadily increased to 1,700 the number of National Guardsmen it says it needs to contain the unrest, and the governor is considering a potential offer of military police put on alert by the Pentagon. Trump stoked the anger on Twitter, saying that if protesters had breached the White House fence, they would “have been greeted with the most vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons, I have ever seen.” Leaders in many affected cities have voiced outrage over Floyd’s killing and expressed sympathy for protesters’ concerns. But as the unrest intensified, they spoke of a desperate need to protect their cities and said they would call in reinforcements, despite concerns that could lead to more heavy-handed tactics. Governors in Georgia, Kentucky, Ohio and Texas also activated the National Guard after protests there turned violent. Police in St. Louis were investigating the death of a protester who climbed between two trailers of a Fed Ex truck and was killed when it drove away. And a person was killed in the area of protests in downtown Detroit just before midnight after someone fired shots into an SUV, officers said.

The shooting drew angry condemnations from Arab residents and leaders and further raised tensions in the region as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu presses ahead with plans to annex large parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Relatives identified the deceased man as Iyad Halak, 32. They said he suffered from autism and was heading to the school for students with special needs where he studied each day when he was shot. “They killed him in cold blood,” Halak’s mother told Israel’s Channel 12 TV. In a statement, Israeli police said they spotted a suspect “with a suspicious object that looked like a pistol.” When he failed to obey orders to stop, officers opened fire, the statement said. Police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld later said no weapon was found. Channel 12 said police fired at Halak and chased him into a dead-end alley. It said a senior officer ordered a halt in fire as they entered the alley, but that a second officer did not listen and fired six or seven bullets from an M-16 rifle, killing Halak. The report said both officers were taken into custody and interrogated for several hours. AP video from the scene showed three bullet holes in a white wall at the end of the alleyway. Halak’s father, Kheiri, said police raided the family’s home after the shooting. “They found nothing,” he said, claiming that police had cursed his daughter when she became upset at them. Lone Palestinian attackers with no clear links to armed groups have carried out a series of stabbings, shootings and car-ramming attacks in recent years. Palestinians and Israeli human rights groups have long accused Israeli security forces of using excessive force in some cases, either by killing individuals who could have been arrested or using lethal force when their lives were not in danger. “We must resist the expected cover-up and make sure that the police will sit in jail,” Ayman Odeh, the leader of the main Arab party in parliament, wrote on Twitter. “Justice will be done only when the Halak family, their friends and the rest of the Palestinian people know freedom and independence.” On social media, some pro-Palestinian activists compared the shooting to this week’s death of George Floyd, the Minnesota man whose death in police custody has set off violent protests across the U.S. Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid, whose daughter is autistic, said Halak’s death was “heartbreaking.” “The death of a young person with special needs is heartbreaking and all of Israel bows their heads. This is not our way,” he tweeted. In west Jerusalem, about 150 protesters, some pounding drums, gathered to demonstrate against police violence. “A violent policeman must stay inside,” they chanted. At a smaller protest in Tel Aviv, one poster read “Palestinian lives matter.” The shooting came a day after Israeli soldiers killed a Palestinian in the occupied West Bank who they said had tried to ram them with his vehicle. No Israelis were wounded in either incident. Saturday’s shooting occurred in east Jerusalem, which Israel captured in the 1967 war along with the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. The Palestinians want all three territories for their future state. Tensions have risen in recent weeks as Israel has pressed ahead with plans to annex large parts of the West Bank in line with President Donald Trump’s Middle East plan, which strongly favors Israel and was rejected by the Palestinians. Netanyahu has said he plans on moving ahead with the plan in July. The Palestinian Authority, which governs autonomous enclaves in the West Bank, said last week that it was no longer bound by past agreements with Israel and the United States and was cutting off all ties, including longstanding security coordination, to protest the annexation plan. The Trump plan would allow the Palestinians to establish a capital on the outskirts of the city, beyond Israel’s separation barrier. It would grant them limited statehood in a cluster of enclaves surrounded by Israel, but only if they meet a long list of stringent conditions. The annexation plan has also drawn widespread condemnations from Israeli allies in Europe and across the Arab world. Send questions/comments to the editors. « Previous Next »",0.0

On Saturday, five days after George Floyd was killed in Minneapolis, Brown tweeted a call to action for his followers to join him walking the streets of Atlanta in the wake of Friday’s events. 5:30 @ cnn to MLK memorial cite come walk with me — Jaylen Brown (@FCHWPO) May 30, 2020 “5:30 @ cnn to MLK memorial cite,” Brown tweeted, referencing the CNN Center in downtown Atlanta. “come walk with me.” “don’t meet me there beat me there come walk with me bring your own signs,” Brown added. Brown spent most of the NBA’s coronavirus shutdown working out in Boston. Over the last week, protests cropped up throughout the country following the death of Floyd in Minneapolis. Floyd, 46, was killed by Derek Chauvin, a police officer who knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes and remained on Floyd after he stopped moving. Chauvin was charged with murder and manslaughter Friday. On Friday, Brown tweeted that there are “no more cheeks to turn,” adding that police brutality is “an act of terrorism.” “Being a bystander is no longer acceptable,” Brown said on Instagram. “If you and your friends are around or are witnesses to cultural biases, micro-aggressions, subtle acts of racism, actual racism etc. and you don’t speak up on it or do something about it, you are part of the problem. We’re past the point where if it’s not in your governance space so you have nothing to do with it. If you don’t speak up on these issues, you just as bad.” Protests in Atlanta on Friday resulted in the destruction of buildings throughout the community. The College Football Hall of Fame was looted, and other businesses were damaged as well. Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms condemned the incidents. “What I see happening on the streets of Atlanta is not Atlanta,” Lance Bottoms said at a news conference. “This is not a protest. This is not in the spirit of Martin Luther King, Jr. This is chaos. A protest has purpose. When Dr. King was assassinated, we didn’t do this to our city. If you want change in America, go and register to vote.” Protests in Boston broke out as well. Some protestors were pepper sprayed outside of the District 4 Boston Police station on Harrison Avenue, but other protests in Massachusetts were peaceful.

NASA’s Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken rode skyward aboard a sleek, white-and-black, bullet-shaped Dragon capsule on top of a Falcon 9 rocket, lifting off at 3:22 p.m. from the same launch pad used to send the Apollo astronauts to the moon a half-century ago. Minutes later, they safely entered orbit. “Let’s light this candle,” Hurley said just before ignition, borrowing the words used by Alan Shepard on America’s first human spaceflight, in 1961. We have liftoff. History is made as @NASA_Astronauts launch from @NASAKennedy for the first time in nine years on the @SpaceX Crew Dragon: pic.twitter.com/alX1t1JBAt — NASA (@NASA) May 30, 2020 The two men are scheduled to arrive at the International Space Station on Sunday for a stay of up to four months, after which they will return to Earth in a Right Stuff-style splashdown at sea. The mission unfolded amid the gloom of the coronavirus outbreak, which has killed over 100,000 Americans, and racial unrest across the U.S. over the death of George Floyd, a handcuffed black man, at the hands of Minneapolis police. NASA officials and others held out hope the flight would would be a morale-booster. “Maybe there’s an opportunity here for America to maybe pause and look up and see a bright, shining moment of hope at what the future looks like, that the United States of America can do extraordinary things even in difficult times,” NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine said before launch. With the on-time liftoff, SpaceX, founded by Musk, the Tesla electric-car visionary, became the first private company to launch people into orbit, a feat achieved previously by only three governments: the U.S., Russia and China. The flight also ended a nine-year launch drought for NASA, the longest such hiatus in its history. Ever since it retired the space shuttle in 2011, NASA has relied on Russian spaceships launched from Kazakhstan to take U.S. astronauts to and from the space station. In the intervening years, NASA outsourced the job of designing and building its next generation of spaceships to SpaceX and Boeing, awarding them $7 billion in contracts in a public-private partnership aimed at driving down costs and spurring innovation. Boeing’s spaceship, the Starliner capsule, is not expected to fly astronauts until early 2021. Musk said earlier in the week that the project is aimed at “reigniting the dream of space and getting people fired up about the future.” Ultimately, NASA hopes to rely in part on its commercial partners as it works to send astronauts back to the moon in the next few years, and on to Mars in the 2030s. Before setting out for the launch pad in a gull-wing Tesla SUV — another Musk product — Behnken pantomimed a hug of his 6-year-old son, Theo, and said: “Are you going to listen to Mommy and make her life easy?” Hurley blew kisses to his 10-year-old son and wife. A launch attempt on Wednesday was called off with less than 17 minutes to go in the countdown because of lightning. On Saturday, stormy weather in Florida threatened another postponement for most of the day, but then the skies began to clear in the afternoonjust in time. Nine minutes after liftoff, the rocket’s first stage booster landed, as designed, on a barge a few hundred miles off the Florida coast. Inside Kennedy Space Center, attendance was strictly limited because of the coronavirus, and the small crowd of a few thousand was a shadow of what it would have been without the threat of COVID-19. President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence flew in for the event for the second time in four days. By NASA’s count, over 3 million viewers tuned in online. Despite NASA’s insistence that the public stay safe by staying home, spectators gathered along beaches and roads hours in advance. Among them was Neil Wight, a machinist from Buffalo, New York, who staked out a view of the launch pad from a park in Titusville. “It’s pretty historically significant in my book, and a lot of other people’s books. With everything that’s going on in this country right now, it’s important that we do things extraordinary in life,” Wight said. “We’ve been bombarded with doom and gloom for the last six, eight weeks, whatever it is, and this is awesome. It brings a lot of people together.” The astronauts were kept in quasi-quarantine for more than two months before liftoff. The SpaceX technicians who helped them get into their spacesuits wore masks and gloves that made them look like black-clad ninjas. And at the launch center, the SpaceX controllers were seated far apart. Hurley, a 53-year-old retired Marine, and Behnken, 49, an Air Force colonel, are veterans of two space shuttle flights each. Hurley piloted the space shuttle on the last launch of astronauts from Kennedy, on July 8, 2011. In keeping with Musk’s penchant for futuristic flash, the astronauts wore angular white uniforms with black trim. Instead of the usual multitude of dials, knobs and switches, the Dragon capsule has three large touchscreens. SpaceX has been launching cargo capsules to the space station since 2012. In preparation for Wednesday’s flight, SpaceX sent up a Dragon capsule with only a test dummy aboard last year, and it docked smoothly at the orbiting outpost on autopilot, then returned to Earth in a splashdown. During the Mercury, Gemini, Apollo and shuttle programs, NASA relied on aerospace contractors to build spacecraft according to the agency’s designs. NASA owned and operated the ships. Under the new, 21st-century partnership, aerospace companies design, build, own and operate the spaceships, and NASA is essentially a paying customer on a list that could eventually include non-government researchers, artists and tourists. (Tom Cruise has already expressed interest.) “What Elon Musk has done for the American space program is he has brought vision and inspiration that we hadn’t had” since the shuttle’s retirement in 2011, Bridenstine said on the eve of launch. He called the SpaceX chief “brilliant” and said Musk has “absolutely delivered” for NASA. The mission is technically considered by SpaceX and NASA to be a test flight. The next SpaceX voyage to the space station, set for the end of August, will have a full, four-person crew: three Americans and one Japanese. Wednesday’s first human flight was originally targeted for around 2015. But NASA’s commercial crew program encountered bureaucratic delays and technical setbacks. A SpaceX capsule exploded on the test stand last year. Boeing’s first Starliner capsule ended up in the wrong orbit during an crew-less test flight in December and was nearly destroyed at the mission’s end. Both companies had trouble with such things as the landing parachutes. Send questions/comments to the editors. filed under:",0.0

(Tom Cruise has already expressed interest.) “What Elon Musk has done for the American space program is he has brought vision and inspiration that we hadn’t had” since the shuttle’s retirement in 2011, Bridenstine said on the eve of launch. He called the SpaceX chief “brilliant” and said Musk has “absolutely delivered” for NASA. The mission is technically considered by SpaceX and NASA to be a test flight. The next SpaceX voyage to the space station, set for the end of August, will have a full, four-person crew: three Americans and one Japanese. Wednesday’s first human flight was originally targeted for around 2015. But NASA’s commercial crew program encountered bureaucratic delays and technical setbacks. A SpaceX capsule exploded on the test stand last year. Boeing’s first Starliner capsule ended up in the wrong orbit during an crew-less test flight in December and was nearly destroyed at the mission’s end. Both companies had trouble with such things as the landing parachutes. « Previous Next » filed under:",0.0
1621130808,2020-05-30 16:26:01,"Disease, hardship, outrage add up to a ‘tinderbox’",https://www.pressherald.com/2020/05/30/disease-hardship-outrage-add-up-to-a-tinderbox/,en,False,,366984,pressherald.com,http://pressherald.com/,"A global pandemic has now killed more than 100,000 Americans and left 40 million unemployed in its wake. Protests – some of them violent – have once again erupted in spots across the country over police killings of black Americans. President Trump, meanwhile, is waging a war against Twitter, attacking his political rivals, criticizing a voting practice he himself uses and suggesting that looters could be shot. America’s persistent political dysfunction and racial inequality were laid bare this week, as the coronavirus death toll hit a tragic new milestone and as the country was served yet another reminder of how black people are killed by law enforcement in disproportionately high numbers. Together, the events present a grim tableau of a nation in crisis – one seared by violence against its citizens, plagued by a deadly disease that remains uncontained and rattled by a devastating blow to its economy. “The threads of our civic life could start unraveling, because everybody’s living in a tinderbox,” said historian and Rice University professor Douglas Brinkley. Barbara Ransby, a historian at the University of Illinois at Chicago and a longtime political activist, said the toll of the coronavirus outbreak made long-standing racial inequities newly stark. Then, images of police violence made those same disparities visceral. “People are seething about all kinds of things,” said Ransby, the author of “Making All Black Lives Matter: Reimagining Freedom in the Twenty-First Century.” “There are major turning points and ruptures in history. . . . This is one of these moments, but we’ve not seen how it will fully play out.” In the days after a 46-year-old black man died in the custody of Minneapolis police in an incident caught on video, demonstrators took to the streets. In that city, a police precinct was breached and set ablaze, along with other businesses. In Colorado, shots were fired near the statehouse. At a protest in Louisville, seven people were shot. Authorities announced charges against the officer in the Minneapolis case Friday – which observers saw as a development that might quell some of the unrest. Some said the tumult, set in the broader context of the twin health and economic emergencies, could mark a rupture as dramatic as signature turning points in the country’s history, from the economic dislocation of the Great Depression to the social convulsions of 1968. Others were skeptical that a fundamental change was at hand. Eric Foner, a historian at Columbia University, said the past is filled with events whose outcomes have not been as sweeping as they seemed to portend. He pointed to examples as disparate as the European revolutions of 1848 – famously said to be the “turning point at which modern history failed to turn” – and Hurricane Katrina in 2005, which exposed lethal failures but did not cause political transformation. “There seems to be a very powerful inertia pushing us back to normal,” Foner said. “I’m skeptical of those who think this coronavirus is going to change everything.” It was only in February that the Senate voted to acquit Trump after he became the third president in U.S. history to be impeached. The next month, much of American business and social activity shut down in an attempt to stem the spread of the novel coronavirus. The country has just now begun to reopen, with culture wars raging over how and when it is safe and appropriate to do so. Then, this week, Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin pressed his knee into the neck of a handcuffed black man, pinning him to the ground. George Floyd died. His cries of “I can’t breathe” quickly rocketed around the world. The protests that erupted in Minnesota spread to places like Columbus, Phoenix, Denver and Louisville, which recently experienced a controversial police killing when officers serving a warrant shot and killed a 26-year-old EMT inside her home. More demonstrations broke out Friday evening across the country, including in the District. Floyd’s death followed the slaying of a black man, Ahmaud Arbery, who was jogging in Georgia, and a viral dust-up in New York’s Central Park when a white woman called the police on a black man there to bird-watch. Both incidents also were captured on video. “I was amazed watching people who were out,” said Raoul Cunningham, head of the NAACP branch in Louisville. “To me, it made clear that we’re at a period of time like we’ve never faced before.” A president’s impeachment, demonstrations over police killings and even global pandemics all have precedents. But their confluence in such a short span of time – under this president, who consistently pushes the boundaries of historic norms associated with his office – has exacerbated the nation’s sense of unease. “It’s natural to wish for life to ‘just get back to normal’ as a pandemic and economic crisis upend everything around us,” former president Barack Obama said in a statement. “But we have to remember that for millions of Americans, being treated differently on account of race is tragically, painfully, maddeningly ‘normal’ – whether it’s while dealing with the health care system, or interacting with the criminal justice system, or jogging down the street, or just watching birds in a park.” Trump responded to the latest crisis Friday as he often does: by lashing out. In a tweet that Twitter labeled as violating its rules meant to stem the glorification of violence, the president attacked Minneapolis’s mayor, a Democrat; labeled the protesters “THUGS”; and vowed to send in the National Guard. “Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts,” he wrote, appearing to echo a warning issued more than 50 years ago by Miami’s police chief amid unrest that gripped blacked neighborhoods there. Trump later sought to clarify that he did not “want” looters to be shot. “It was spoken as a fact, not as a statement,” he said. Former vice president Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, took a veiled shot at the president, saying in a video address that this was “no time to encourage violence.” He said he had spoken with Floyd’s family and called on Americans to confront the nation’s history of racial injustice. “The original sin of this country still stains our nation today,” Biden said. “And sometimes we manage to overlook it. We just push forward with a thousand other tasks in our daily life. But it’s always there. And weeks like this, we see it plainly that we’re a country with an open wound.” In Minnesota, some local officials acknowledged that the demonstrations – at least before the charges were announced – seemed to be spiraling beyond their control. Police at one point took a CNN correspondent and crew into custody on live TV, though they were later released. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, a Democrat, said in an emotional news conference that the unrest was a result of “generations of pain, of anguish” over racism in policing. Hodan Hassan, a state lawmaker who represents part of the district engulfed in flames this week, said the devastation visited on businesses there will only deepen the economic pain familiar to south Minneapolis – and now spreading across the country in the pandemic’s wake. “This community was struggling because of years of disinvestment,” she said. “And then the pandemic came. And to add fuel to the fire, now this is happening. It feels like we can’t catch a break.” Ben Crump, a lawyer for Floyd’s family, said in a statement that Chauvin’s arrest was “welcome,” but that the family expected more serious charges and also wanted other officers at the scene to be taken into custody. “The pain that the black community feels over this murder and what it reflects about the treatment of black people in America is raw and is spilling out onto streets across America,” Crump said. Brinkley, the Rice University historian, said the moment seemed akin to Richard Nixon’s presidency, when the country was divided politically over the Vietnam War and the president was attacking the press over the Pentagon Papers. Trump, he said, seems to see the unrest as a potentially helpful “political issue,” if he can position himself as a law-and-order candidate cracking down on anarchy and possibly distract from the pandemic. A Washington Post national average of polls in May shows Trump trailing Biden by seven points, 42 percent to 49 percent. “Is this going to be the summer of COVID-19? Or is this going to be the summer of urban unrest?” Brinkley said. “And Trump does not want it to be the summer of COVID-19.” Jameel Jaffer, executive director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, said Trump seemed to be exacerbating the crisis. “It seems like many of the institutions that we have relied on to check government power have been weakened considerably over the last few years,” he said. “Norms that we took for granted have been eroded. And at a time when what is most needed is thoughtful, calm, deliberate leadership, we have the opposite.”",0.0

Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) during a campaign event on March 2, 2020 in Dallas, Texas. Klobuchar has suspended her campaign and endorsed Biden before the upcoming Super Tuesday Democratic presidential primaries. (Photo by Ron Jenkins/Getty Images) Advertisement Biden ally sees Klobuchar as less likely Biden running mate Share Shares Copy Link Copy Sen. Amy Klobuchar seems a less likely choice to become Joe Biden's running mate on his presidential ticket following this week's death of a black man in police custody in Minneapolis, a key ally of the former vice president said Friday. Rep. James Clyburn, D-S.C., told reporters that while he believes Klobuchar is “absolutely” qualified to be vice president, “This is very tough timing for her.” Klobuchar, D-Minn., was a prosecutor years ago in the county that includes Minneapolis. As she was leaving the post to join the Senate, an officer involved in this week’s death of George Floyd was involved in the death of another man. The officer ultimately was not prosecuted. Clyburn, who said his view was his “gut feeling,” played a pivotal role in helping Biden become the party’s all-but-certain presidential nominee. Clyburn is the No. 3 House Democratic leader and Congress’ highest-ranking black lawmaker.Related: NY protesters demand justice for George Floyd“So often in politics, timing really dictates things, Barack Obama I don’t think could have gotten elected four years before he got elected,"" Clyburn said of the former president during a conference call. “And I don’t know whether he could get elected today.”On MSNBC, Biden said the tensions in Minnesota have “nothing to do with my running mate.” Pressed on whether Floyd’s killing increases pressure to place an African American woman on his ticket, Biden said he's talked about putting women of color on the Supreme Court and in his Cabinet. “And I also already said that there are women of color under consideration,"" he said. Clyburn helped revive Biden’s badly flagging presidential campaign earlier this year, lifting him to a decisive triumph in a South Carolina primary in which large numbers of voters were black. That fueled a Biden run to a string of victories in other state contests that resulted in his becoming the party’s presumptive nominee. Before being elected to the Senate in 2006, Klobuchar, who is white, was prosecutor of Minnesota's largest county, which includes Minneapolis. While Klobuchar was in that job, more than two dozen citizens died during encounters with police but none of the officers involved were criminally charged. Most victims were people of color, according to data compiled by Communities United Against Police Brutality and news articles reviewed by the AP. An officer involved in one of the past fatal incidents was Derek Chauvin, who was arrested and charged Friday in this week's death of Floyd. A video showing Floyd complaining that he could not breath as Chauvin kneeled on his neck has helped spark unrest in cities around the country. Chauvin was among six officers who fired on and killed a man in 2006 who reportedly stabbed two people and then aimed a shotgun at police. The case went to the grand jury after Klobuchar had been elected to the Senate and had left the county attorney’s office. Klobuchar did not respond to a request by The Associated Press for an interview on Friday. But she told NBC news that reports stating she had declined the case involving Chauvin years ago were “absolutely false.”Klobuchar told the network that during the years she led the office, it was the practice to present police shooting cases to a grand jury to consider charges. She said she now believes the practice of asking a grand jury to decide whether to charge officers was wrong. Klobuchar and 27 other Democratic senators wrote a letter Friday to the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division, asking it to investigate “patterns and practices of racially discriminatory and violent policing” by the Minneapolis police. ___AP reporters Sara Burnett in Chicago and Will Weissert in Washington contributed to this report.",0.0
1621131085,2020-05-30 15:47:34,SpaceX’s Crew Dragon launches first manned test flight to space station,https://www.centralmaine.com/2020/05/30/spacexs-crew-dragon-launches-first-manned-test-flight-to-space-station/,en,False,,25755,Central Maine News,https://www.centralmaine.com/,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. — A rocket ship built by Elon Musk’s SpaceX company thundered away from Earth with two Americans on board Saturday, ushering in a new era of commercial space travel and putting NASA back in the business of launching astronauts from U.S. soil for the first time in nearly a decade. NASA’s Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken rode skyward aboard a sleek, white-and-black, bullet-shaped Dragon capsule on top of a Falcon 9 rocket, lifting off at 3:22 p.m. from the same launch pad used to send the Apollo astronauts to the moon a half-century ago. Minutes later, they safely entered orbit. “Let’s light this candle,” Hurley said just before ignition, borrowing the words used by Alan Shepard on America’s first human spaceflight, in 1961. We have liftoff. History is made as @NASA_Astronauts launch from @NASAKennedy for the first time in nine years on the @SpaceX Crew Dragon: pic.twitter.com/alX1t1JBAt — NASA (@NASA) May 30, 2020 The two men are scheduled to arrive at the International Space Station on Sunday for a stay of up to four months, after which they will return to Earth in a Right Stuff-style splashdown at sea. The mission unfolded amid the gloom of the coronavirus outbreak, which has killed over 100,000 Americans, and racial unrest across the U.S. over the death of George Floyd, a handcuffed black man, at the hands of Minneapolis police. NASA officials and others held out hope the flight would would be a morale-booster. “Maybe there’s an opportunity here for America to maybe pause and look up and see a bright, shining moment of hope at what the future looks like, that the United States of America can do extraordinary things even in difficult times,” NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine said before launch. With the on-time liftoff, SpaceX, founded by Musk, the Tesla electric-car visionary, became the first private company to launch people into orbit, a feat achieved previously by only three governments: the U.S., Russia and China. The flight also ended a nine-year launch drought for NASA, the longest such hiatus in its history. Ever since it retired the space shuttle in 2011, NASA has relied on Russian spaceships launched from Kazakhstan to take U.S. astronauts to and from the space station. In the intervening years, NASA outsourced the job of designing and building its next generation of spaceships to SpaceX and Boeing, awarding them $7 billion in contracts in a public-private partnership aimed at driving down costs and spurring innovation. Boeing’s spaceship, the Starliner capsule, is not expected to fly astronauts until early 2021. Musk said earlier in the week that the project is aimed at “reigniting the dream of space and getting people fired up about the future.” Ultimately, NASA hopes to rely in part on its commercial partners as it works to send astronauts back to the moon in the next few years, and on to Mars in the 2030s. Before setting out for the launch pad in a gull-wing Tesla SUV — another Musk product — Behnken pantomimed a hug of his 6-year-old son, Theo, and said: “Are you going to listen to Mommy and make her life easy?” Hurley blew kisses to his 10-year-old son and wife. A launch attempt on Wednesday was called off with less than 17 minutes to go in the countdown because of lightning. On Saturday, stormy weather in Florida threatened another postponement for most of the day, but then the skies began to clear in the afternoonjust in time. Nine minutes after liftoff, the rocket’s first stage booster landed, as designed, on a barge a few hundred miles off the Florida coast. Inside Kennedy Space Center, attendance was strictly limited because of the coronavirus, and the small crowd of a few thousand was a shadow of what it would have been without the threat of COVID-19. President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence flew in for the event for the second time in four days. By NASA’s count, over 3 million viewers tuned in online. Despite NASA’s insistence that the public stay safe by staying home, spectators gathered along beaches and roads hours in advance. Among them was Neil Wight, a machinist from Buffalo, New York, who staked out a view of the launch pad from a park in Titusville. “It’s pretty historically significant in my book, and a lot of other people’s books. With everything that’s going on in this country right now, it’s important that we do things extraordinary in life,” Wight said. “We’ve been bombarded with doom and gloom for the last six, eight weeks, whatever it is, and this is awesome. It brings a lot of people together.” The astronauts were kept in quasi-quarantine for more than two months before liftoff. The SpaceX technicians who helped them get into their spacesuits wore masks and gloves that made them look like black-clad ninjas. And at the launch center, the SpaceX controllers were seated far apart. Hurley, a 53-year-old retired Marine, and Behnken, 49, an Air Force colonel, are veterans of two space shuttle flights each. Hurley piloted the space shuttle on the last launch of astronauts from Kennedy, on July 8, 2011. In keeping with Musk’s penchant for futuristic flash, the astronauts wore angular white uniforms with black trim. Instead of the usual multitude of dials, knobs and switches, the Dragon capsule has three large touchscreens. SpaceX has been launching cargo capsules to the space station since 2012. In preparation for Wednesday’s flight, SpaceX sent up a Dragon capsule with only a test dummy aboard last year, and it docked smoothly at the orbiting outpost on autopilot, then returned to Earth in a splashdown. During the Mercury, Gemini, Apollo and shuttle programs, NASA relied on aerospace contractors to build spacecraft according to the agency’s designs. NASA owned and operated the ships. Under the new, 21st-century partnership, aerospace companies design, build, own and operate the spaceships, and NASA is essentially a paying customer on a list that could eventually include non-government researchers, artists and tourists.

1621131083,2020-05-30 16:19:58,Israeli police kill unarmed autistic Palestinian man,https://www.centralmaine.com/2020/05/30/israeli-police-kill-unarmed-autistic-palestinian-man/,en,False,,25755,Central Maine News,https://www.centralmaine.com/,"JERUSALEM — Israeli police shot dead an unarmed autistic Palestinian man in Jerusalem’s Old City on Saturday after mistakenly suspecting he was carrying a weapon. The shooting drew angry condemnations from Arab residents and leaders and further raised tensions in the region as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu presses ahead with plans to annex large parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Relatives identified the deceased man as Iyad Halak, 32. They said he suffered from autism and was heading to the school for students with special needs where he studied each day when he was shot. “They killed him in cold blood,” Halak’s mother told Israel’s Channel 12 TV. In a statement, Israeli police said they spotted a suspect “with a suspicious object that looked like a pistol.” When he failed to obey orders to stop, officers opened fire, the statement said. Police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld later said no weapon was found. Channel 12 said police fired at Halak and chased him into a dead-end alley. It said a senior officer ordered a halt in fire as they entered the alley, but that a second officer did not listen and fired six or seven bullets from an M-16 rifle, killing Halak. The report said both officers were taken into custody and interrogated for several hours. AP video from the scene showed three bullet holes in a white wall at the end of the alleyway. Halak’s father, Kheiri, said police raided the family’s home after the shooting. “They found nothing,” he said, claiming that police had cursed his daughter when she became upset at them. Lone Palestinian attackers with no clear links to armed groups have carried out a series of stabbings, shootings and car-ramming attacks in recent years. Palestinians and Israeli human rights groups have long accused Israeli security forces of using excessive force in some cases, either by killing individuals who could have been arrested or using lethal force when their lives were not in danger. “We must resist the expected cover-up and make sure that the police will sit in jail,” Ayman Odeh, the leader of the main Arab party in parliament, wrote on Twitter. “Justice will be done only when the Halak family, their friends and the rest of the Palestinian people know freedom and independence.” On social media, some pro-Palestinian activists compared the shooting to this week’s death of George Floyd, the Minnesota man whose death in police custody has set off violent protests across the U.S. Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid, whose daughter is autistic, said Halak’s death was “heartbreaking.” “The death of a young person with special needs is heartbreaking and all of Israel bows their heads. This is not our way,” he tweeted. In west Jerusalem, about 150 protesters, some pounding drums, gathered to demonstrate against police violence. “A violent policeman must stay inside,” they chanted. At a smaller protest in Tel Aviv, one poster read “Palestinian lives matter.” The shooting came a day after Israeli soldiers killed a Palestinian in the occupied West Bank who they said had tried to ram them with his vehicle. No Israelis were wounded in either incident. Saturday’s shooting occurred in east Jerusalem, which Israel captured in the 1967 war along with the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. The Palestinians want all three territories for their future state. Tensions have risen in recent weeks as Israel has pressed ahead with plans to annex large parts of the West Bank in line with President Donald Trump’s Middle East plan, which strongly favors Israel and was rejected by the Palestinians. Netanyahu has said he plans on moving ahead with the plan in July. The Palestinian Authority, which governs autonomous enclaves in the West Bank, said last week that it was no longer bound by past agreements with Israel and the United States and was cutting off all ties, including longstanding security coordination, to protest the annexation plan. The Trump plan would allow the Palestinians to establish a capital on the outskirts of the city, beyond Israel’s separation barrier. It would grant them limited statehood in a cluster of enclaves surrounded by Israel, but only if they meet a long list of stringent conditions. The annexation plan has also drawn widespread condemnations from Israeli allies in Europe and across the Arab world. Send questions/comments to the editors. « Previous Next »",0.0

""It was not enough,"" Maj. Gen. Jon A. Jensen said Saturday. Now, with a fifth night of protests looming, Jensen, head of the state's National Guard, said authorities are drastically increasing the military presence in Minneapolis. Officials expected to deploy some 2,500 soldiers and airmen by midday Saturday and will soon mobilize the state's full National Guard force of more than 13,000 — ""an action that has never been taken in 164-year history of the Minnesota National Guard,"" according to Gov. Tim Walz, who spoke at a joint news conference with Jensen. ""We understand the work that we need to do and the generational pain that went into what happened with George Floyd and that murder,"" the governor said Saturday. ""But at this point in time, nothing we do to address those inequities, nothing we do to provide justice to George Floyd and his family that I spoke with last evening — none of those things matter to any of these people who are out there firing upon National Guard, burning businesses of our communities and making intent on disrupting any semblance of civil life."" The Pentagon has also placed as many as 800 members of the military police on prepare-to-deploy orders, a U.S. official confirmed to NPR. The officers would be available to assist with logistics, analysis or surveillance if requested by the governor. More than 1,000 additional Citizen-Soldiers and Airmen are activating today. This is in addition to the 700 that were on duty as of late last night. This represents the largest domestic deployment in the Minnesota’s National Guard’s 164-year history. pic.twitter.com/aV9NOFv5uo — MN National Guard (@MNNationalGuard) May 30, 2020 Less than a week has passed since Floyd's death in police custody. The disturbing video of his arrest, filmed by a bystander Monday evening in Minneapolis, shows Officer Derek Chauvin with his knee on the neck of the handcuffed black man for more than seven minutes. The white police officer — who has since been fired and charged with murder — continues to plant his weight on Floyd well after his pleas for help give way to an unresponsive silence. A federal investigation remains underway into the incident, with more charges possible for Chauvin and the three other officers seen in the video. That has not satisfied protesters, whose furor over Floyd's death has spread well beyond Minneapolis. A slew of cities — from Detroit to Atlanta, from Los Angeles to Washington, D.C. — have seen protesters gather to voice their outrage about police treatment of African Americans. In many of those cities, gatherings turned violent, with some protesters clashing with police and damaging buildings. Law enforcement reported hundreds of arrests across the country and at least one death — a 19-year-old man who was killed when someone fired into a crowd in Detroit, according to local police. Several people were also injured by gunfire Thursday night in Louisville, Ky., where crowds have gathered to protest a grievance closer to home: the death of Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old black woman who was shot and killed by police in her own apartment earlier this year. There were no incidents of gun violence linked to the protests Friday night in Louisville, but NPR member station WFPL reports that clashes erupted between protesters and police. Protesters shattered windows at the courthouse, and police fired tear gas to disperse the crowds, according to WFPL. On Saturday, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear announced that he, too, was calling up the National Guard, in order ""to help keep peace in Louisville."" ""I hope everybody knows this is a big step and a tough step, and it's not one intended to silence any voice, because I want to hear,"" Beshear said in a statement explaining the move. ""But I want to make sure at the end of the day that we are all safe."" President Trump weighed in on the protests Saturday. He said the best way to honor Floyd's memory is for authorities to ""get tougher"" on the protesters who resort to violence, whom he called ""radical left, bad people [who] have got to be taught that you can't do this."" ""They've got to be tough, they've got to be smart,"" Trump said of state officials. ""We have our military ready, willing and able if they ever want to call on our military. But we could have troops on the ground very quickly if they ever want our military."" In a statement Saturday, Attorney General William Barr echoed Trump's comments, saying that though the outrage is ""real and legitimate,"" the protests are ""being hijacked by violent radical elements."" ""Groups of outside radicals and agitators are exploiting the situation to pursue their own separate and violent agenda,"" Barr said. ""In many places, it appears the violence is planned, organized, and driven by anarchistic and far left extremists, using Antifa-like tactics, many of whom travel from out of state to promote the violence.""

Protests – some of them violent – have once again erupted in spots across the country over police killings of black Americans. President Trump, meanwhile, is waging a war against Twitter, attacking his political rivals, criticizing a voting practice he himself uses and suggesting that looters could be shot. America’s persistent political dysfunction and racial inequality were laid bare this week, as the coronavirus death toll hit a tragic new milestone and as the country was served yet another reminder of how black people are killed by law enforcement in disproportionately high numbers. Together, the events present a grim tableau of a nation in crisis – one seared by violence against its citizens, plagued by a deadly disease that remains uncontained and rattled by a devastating blow to its economy. “The threads of our civic life could start unraveling, because everybody’s living in a tinderbox,” said historian and Rice University professor Douglas Brinkley. Barbara Ransby, a historian at the University of Illinois at Chicago and a longtime political activist, said the toll of the coronavirus outbreak made long-standing racial inequities newly stark. Then, images of police violence made those same disparities visceral. “People are seething about all kinds of things,” said Ransby, the author of “Making All Black Lives Matter: Reimagining Freedom in the Twenty-First Century.” “There are major turning points and ruptures in history. . . . This is one of these moments, but we’ve not seen how it will fully play out.” In the days after a 46-year-old black man died in the custody of Minneapolis police in an incident caught on video, demonstrators took to the streets. In that city, a police precinct was breached and set ablaze, along with other businesses. In Colorado, shots were fired near the statehouse. At a protest in Louisville, seven people were shot. Authorities announced charges against the officer in the Minneapolis case Friday – which observers saw as a development that might quell some of the unrest. Some said the tumult, set in the broader context of the twin health and economic emergencies, could mark a rupture as dramatic as signature turning points in the country’s history, from the economic dislocation of the Great Depression to the social convulsions of 1968. Others were skeptical that a fundamental change was at hand. Eric Foner, a historian at Columbia University, said the past is filled with events whose outcomes have not been as sweeping as they seemed to portend. He pointed to examples as disparate as the European revolutions of 1848 – famously said to be the “turning point at which modern history failed to turn” – and Hurricane Katrina in 2005, which exposed lethal failures but did not cause political transformation. “There seems to be a very powerful inertia pushing us back to normal,” Foner said. “I’m skeptical of those who think this coronavirus is going to change everything.” It was only in February that the Senate voted to acquit Trump after he became the third president in U.S. history to be impeached. The next month, much of American business and social activity shut down in an attempt to stem the spread of the novel coronavirus. The country has just now begun to reopen, with culture wars raging over how and when it is safe and appropriate to do so. Then, this week, Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin pressed his knee into the neck of a handcuffed black man, pinning him to the ground. George Floyd died. His cries of “I can’t breathe” quickly rocketed around the world. The protests that erupted in Minnesota spread to places like Columbus, Phoenix, Denver and Louisville, which recently experienced a controversial police killing when officers serving a warrant shot and killed a 26-year-old EMT inside her home. More demonstrations broke out Friday evening across the country, including in the District. Floyd’s death followed the slaying of a black man, Ahmaud Arbery, who was jogging in Georgia, and a viral dust-up in New York’s Central Park when a white woman called the police on a black man there to bird-watch. Both incidents also were captured on video. “I was amazed watching people who were out,” said Raoul Cunningham, head of the NAACP branch in Louisville. “To me, it made clear that we’re at a period of time like we’ve never faced before.” A president’s impeachment, demonstrations over police killings and even global pandemics all have precedents. But their confluence in such a short span of time – under this president, who consistently pushes the boundaries of historic norms associated with his office – has exacerbated the nation’s sense of unease. “It’s natural to wish for life to ‘just get back to normal’ as a pandemic and economic crisis upend everything around us,” former president Barack Obama said in a statement. “But we have to remember that for millions of Americans, being treated differently on account of race is tragically, painfully, maddeningly ‘normal’ – whether it’s while dealing with the health care system, or interacting with the criminal justice system, or jogging down the street, or just watching birds in a park.” Trump responded to the latest crisis Friday as he often does: by lashing out. In a tweet that Twitter labeled as violating its rules meant to stem the glorification of violence, the president attacked Minneapolis’s mayor, a Democrat; labeled the protesters “THUGS”; and vowed to send in the National Guard. “Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts,” he wrote, appearing to echo a warning issued more than 50 years ago by Miami’s police chief amid unrest that gripped blacked neighborhoods there. Trump later sought to clarify that he did not “want” looters to be shot. “It was spoken as a fact, not as a statement,” he said. Former vice president Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, took a veiled shot at the president, saying in a video address that this was “no time to encourage violence.” He said he had spoken with Floyd’s family and called on Americans to confront the nation’s history of racial injustice. “The original sin of this country still stains our nation today,” Biden said. “And sometimes we manage to overlook it. We just push forward with a thousand other tasks in our daily life. But it’s always there. And weeks like this, we see it plainly that we’re a country with an open wound.” In Minnesota, some local officials acknowledged that the demonstrations – at least before the charges were announced – seemed to be spiraling beyond their control. Police at one point took a CNN correspondent and crew into custody on live TV, though they were later released. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, a Democrat, said in an emotional news conference that the unrest was a result of “generations of pain, of anguish” over racism in policing. Hodan Hassan, a state lawmaker who represents part of the district engulfed in flames this week, said the devastation visited on businesses there will only deepen the economic pain familiar to south Minneapolis – and now spreading across the country in the pandemic’s wake. “This community was struggling because of years of disinvestment,” she said. “And then the pandemic came. And to add fuel to the fire, now this is happening. It feels like we can’t catch a break.” Ben Crump, a lawyer for Floyd’s family, said in a statement that Chauvin’s arrest was “welcome,” but that the family expected more serious charges and also wanted other officers at the scene to be taken into custody. “The pain that the black community feels over this murder and what it reflects about the treatment of black people in America is raw and is spilling out onto streets across America,” Crump said. Brinkley, the Rice University historian, said the moment seemed akin to Richard Nixon’s presidency, when the country was divided politically over the Vietnam War and the president was attacking the press over the Pentagon Papers. Trump, he said, seems to see the unrest as a potentially helpful “political issue,” if he can position himself as a law-and-order candidate cracking down on anarchy and possibly distract from the pandemic. A Washington Post national average of polls in May shows Trump trailing Biden by seven points, 42 percent to 49 percent. “Is this going to be the summer of COVID-19? Or is this going to be the summer of urban unrest?” Brinkley said. “And Trump does not want it to be the summer of COVID-19.” Jameel Jaffer, executive director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, said Trump seemed to be exacerbating the crisis. “It seems like many of the institutions that we have relied on to check government power have been weakened considerably over the last few years,” he said. “Norms that we took for granted have been eroded. And at a time when what is most needed is thoughtful, calm, deliberate leadership, we have the opposite.”",0.0
1621135124,2020-05-30 16:27:55,"Cities brace for increasing unrest, call in National Guard",https://www.sunjournal.com/2020/05/30/cities-brace-for-increasing-unrest-call-in-national-guard/,en,False,,68001,sunjournal.com,http://www.sunjournal.com/#spider,"MINNEAPOLIS — Protesters set police cars ablaze, smashed businesses’ windows and skirmished with baton-wielding officers in streets from Atlanta to Los Angeles, as anger over George Floyd’s death spread across the country. Authorities were bracing for more violence Saturday, with some calling in the National Guard to beef up overwhelmed forces. In Minneapolis, the city where Floyd died Monday after a white police officer pressed a knee into his neck and kept it there for more than eight minutes, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz fully mobilized the state’s National Guard and promised a massive show of force to help quell unrest that has grown increasingly destructive. “The situation in Minneapolis is no longer in any way about the murder of George Floyd,” Walz said. “It is about attacking civil society, instilling fear and disrupting our great cities.” On Friday alone, racially diverse crowds took to the streets in more than two dozen cities — from New York to Oakland, California, from Atlanta to Portland, Oregon — for protests that typically began peacefully before many descended into violence. At least two deaths were connected to the demonstrations; hundreds of people were arrested and police used batons, rubber bullets and pepper spray to push back crowds in some cities. Many departments reported officers were injured, while social media was awash in images of police using forceful tactics, throwing protesters to the ground, using bicycles as shields, and trampling a protester while on horseback. Many protesters spoke of frustration that Floyd’s death was one more in a litany. It comes in the wake of the killing in Georgia of Ahmaud Arbery, who was shot after being pursued by two white men while running in their neighborhood, and in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic that has thrown millions out of work, killed more than 100,000 people in the U.S. and disproportionately affected black people. On Friday, the officer who held his knee to Floyd’s neck was arrested and charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter — but that appeared to provide little balm. Many protesters are demanding the arrests of the three other officers involved. Comments from President Trump stoked the anger, when he fired off a series of tweets criticizing Minnesota’s response, ridiculing people who protested outside the White House and warning that if protesters breached the fence, “they would … have been greeted with the most vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons, I have ever seen.” Leaders in many affected cities have voiced outrage over Floyd’s killing and offered sympathy for those who were protesting — but as unrest intensified, many spoke of the desperate need to protect their cities and said they would call in reinforcements, despite concerns that could lead to more heavy handed tactics. Minnesota has steadily increased the number of National Guardsmen it says it needs to contain the unrest, and has now called up 1,700. He is also considering a potential offer of military police, which the Pentagon put on alert. Georgia’s governor declared a state of emergency early Saturday to activate the state National Guard as violence flared in Atlanta. Portland, Oregon, Mayor Ted Wheeler also declared an emergency and ordered a nighttime curfew for the city. The mayor of Cincinnati announced a curfew Saturday and Sunday following damage to about 50 businesses during protests there. The Guard was also on standby in the District of Columbia, where a crowd grew outside the White House and chanted curses at Trump. Some protesters tried to push through barriers set up by the U.S. Secret Service along Pennsylvania Avenue, and threw bottles and other objects at officers wearing riot gear, who responded with pepper spray. “I just feel like he’s just one of many names that we’ve had to create hashtags and T-shirts and campaigns for and I feel like nothing has changed,” district resident Abe Neri said of Floyd. “And so that’s why I’m out here. Yeah, when you say nothing you’re taking the side of the oppressor.” A person was killed in downtown Detroit just before midnight after someone in an SUV fired shots into a crowd of protesters near the Greektown entertainment district, police said. And police in St. Louis were investigating the death of a protester who had climbed between two trailers of a Fed Ex truck and was killed when it drove away. Atlanta saw some of the most extreme unrest. While crews in that city worked to clean up glass and debris from rioting the night before, a large electronic billboard on Saturday morning still carried the message, “If you love Atlanta PLEASE GO HOME,” echoing the mayor’s pleas. National Guard members blocked anyone from approaching heavily damaged buildings, including the College Football Hall of Fame and nearby restaurants. “This is not in the spirit of Martin Luther King Jr.,” Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said. “You are disgracing the life of George Floyd and every other person who has been killed in this country.” Bottoms was flanked by King’s daughter, Bernice King, and rappers T.I. and Killer Mike. “We have to be better than burning down our own homes. Because if we lose Atlanta what have we got?” said Killer Mike, crying as he spoke. Video posted to social media showed New York City officers using batons and shoving protesters down as they took people into custody and cleared streets. One video showed on officer slam a woman to the ground as he walked past her in the street. Demonstrators rocked a police van, set it ablaze, scrawled graffiti across its charred body and set it aflame again as officers retreated. “There will be a full review of what happened tonight,” Mayor Bill de Blasio tweeted, referring to the Brooklyn protest. “We don’t ever want to see another night like this.” Underscoring that Floyd’s killing is part of a pattern, the names of black people killed by police, including Eric Garner, who died on Staten Island in 2014, were on signs and in chants. “Our country has a sickness. We have to be out here,” said Brianna Petrisko, among those at lower Manhattan’s Foley Square, where most were wearing masks amid the coronavirus pandemic. “This is the only way we’re going to be heard.” In Houston and Dallas, Los Angeles and Oakland, California., protesters blocked interstates, but much of the ire in many cities was focused at police. In Portland, Oregon, protesters lit a fire inside police headquarters. Protesters in Houston, where Floyd grew up, included 19-year-old Jimmy Ohaz from the nearby city of Richmond, Texas: “My question is how many more, how many more? I just want to live in a future where we all live in harmony and we’re not oppressed.” « Previous Next »",0.0

Demonstrators also broke windows and vandalized the Atlanta office building where CNN is headquartered, and police in Louisville, Kentucky, apologized on Saturday after an officer fired what appeared to be pepper bullets at a television news crew. Fox’s Leland Vittert was rattled following the Washington attack he said was clearly targeted at his news organization. Related Louisville PD apologizes for targeting news crew at protest “We took a good thumping,” he told The Associated Press. A live shot he was doing was interrupted by a group of protesters who shouted obscenities directed at Fox. Flanked by two security guards, he and photographer Christian Galdabini walked away from Washington’s Lafayette Park trailed by an angry group before riot police dispersed them. Vittert said there were no markings on him or the crew’s equipment to identify them as from Fox. But he said during the demonstration, one man continually asked him who he worked for. He didn’t answer, but the man found a picture of Vittert on his cell phone and shouted to other protesters that he was from Fox. “The protesters stopped protesting whatever it was they were protesting and turned on us,” he said, “and that was a very different feeling.” He compared it to when he was chased away from a demonstration in Egypt during the Arab Spring of 2011 by a group that shouted, “Fox News hates Muslims.” A correspondent from the website The Daily Caller followed Vittert and the demonstrators as they left the park. At one point, someone took Vittert’s microphone and threw it at his back. One woman chasing him wore a t-shirt that said, “I can’t breathe,” a reference what Floyd said earlier this week when a Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee against his neck. Vittert said he was “extremely grateful” to the Daily Caller for documenting the scene; Galdabini’s camera was smashed. “They were putting themselves at risk,” he said. “It makes me proud to do my job and to be a journalist,” he said. “I’m proud to be an organization that is unyielding in our coverage. We’re going to keep on telling our story and doing exactly what we’re doing.” Suzanne Scott, CEO of Fox News Media, said in a memo on Saturday that Fox was taking all necessary security precautions to protect its journalists covering the story. “We are truly living in unprecedented and transformative times and freedom of the press is a vital element to the foundation of our society,” Scott wrote. On Friday, CNN correspondent Omar Jimenez and his two-person crew were arrested while covering overnight protests in Minneapolis. They were quickly released, and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz apologized to CNN. CNN’s headquarters in Atlanta was targeted later Friday by a group of protesters who also fought with police and set cars afire. While police tried to keep them away from the CNN Center, demonstrators broke windows there and scrawled obscene graffiti on the network’s logo. In Louisville, WAVE-TV was on the air covering a demonstration when video showed a police officer aiming a rifle at reporter Kaitlin Rust and her crew. She was heard yelling, “I’ve been shot! I’ve been shot!” and described them as pepper bullets. Louisville Police spokeswoman Jesse Halladay apologized for the incident, and said police would review the video for potential discipline. In Minneapolis on Saturday, a Swedish journalist was shot in the thigh with a rubber bullet, apparently from a police gun, while covering a protest, according to the Norwegian newspaper VG. AP correspondents Mike Stewart in Atlanta, Jari Tanner in Minneapolis and Bruce Schreiner and Dylan Lovan in Louisville contributed to this report. « Previous Next »",0.0
1621135120,2020-05-30 16:43:35,US cities fear protests may fuel new wave of virus outbreaks,https://www.sunjournal.com/2020/05/30/us-cities-fear-protests-may-fuel-new-wave-of-virus-outbreaks/,en,False,,68001,sunjournal.com,http://www.sunjournal.com/#spider,"LOS ANGELES — The massive protests sweeping across U.S. cities following the police killing of a handcuffed black man in Minnesota have elevated fears of a new surge in cases of the coronavirus. Images showing thousands of screaming, unmasked protesters have sent shudders through the health community, which worries its calls for social distancing during the demonstrations are unlikely to be heard. Leaders appealing for calm in places where crowds smashed storefronts and destroyed police cars in recent nights also have been handing out masks and warning protesters they were putting themselves at risk. Related Hundreds take to Portland streets to protest Minneapolis police killing Minnesota’s governor said Saturday that too many protesters weren’t socially distancing or wearing masks after heeding the call earlier in the week. But many seemed undeterred. “It’s not OK that in the middle of a pandemic we have to be out here risking our lives,” Spence Ingram said Friday after marching with other protesters to the state Capitol in Atlanta. “But I have to protest for my life and fight for my life all the time.” Ingram, 25, who was wearing a mask, said she has asthma and was worried about contracting the virus. But she said as a black woman, she always felt that her life was under threat from police and she needed to protest that. The demonstrations over the killing of George Floyd, a black man who died after a white Minneapolis officer pressed a knee into his neck, are coming at a time when many cities were beginning to relax stay-at-home orders. That’s especially worrisome for health experts who fear that silent carriers of the virus who have no symptoms could unwittingly infect others at gatherings with people packed cheek to jowl and cheering and jeering without masks. “Whether they’re fired up or not that doesn’t prevent them from getting the virus,” said Bradley Pollock, chairman of the Department of Public Health Sciences at the University of California, Davis. Images from many demonstrations show most protesters have been wearing masks, but that doesn’t guarantee protection from the coronavirus. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends cloth masks because they can make it more difficult for infected people to spread the virus — but they are not designed to protect the person wearing the mask from getting the virus. The U.S. has been worst hit by the coronavirus outbreak, with more than 1.7 million cases and over 103,000 deaths, according to a tally kept by Johns Hopkins University. In New York City, where more than 21,000 people have died during the pandemic, a large crowd in Brooklyn tossed water bottles at officers and torched a police van Friday outside the Barclays Center. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said after another night of unrest in Minneapolis that many protesters wearing masks were simply trying to hide their identities and “cause confusion and take advantage of this situation.” “I will continue to stress, because it seems like a lifetime ago: We are still in the middle of a pandemic and passed 1,000 deaths yesterday. We still have hospitals on the verge of being overrun with COVID-19,” he said. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey echoed those concerns. “We have two crises that are sandwiched on top of one other,” he said. The state’s health commissioner had warned just days earlier that the massive protests were almost certain to fuel new cases of the virus. Minnesota reported 35 deaths on Thursday, a single-day high since the start of the outbreak, and 29 more on Friday. But it wasn’t just protesters at risk. Images showed unmasked officers standing alongside demonstrators. In Atlanta, police Chief Erika Shields waded into a crowd without a mask Friday while she listened to people air frustrations. When Los Angeles officials announced earlier in the week that the city was relaxing stay-at-home orders and reopening stores, they also said political protests could resume but with a cap of 100 people. Several hundred people showed up for a protest organized by Black Lives Matter-LA and later shut down a freeway. Most wore masks, but many did not observe a buffer zone. Los Angeles County Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer said Friday that was an ongoing concern. “Show respect for each other by putting on that face covering so that your respiratory droplets aren’t unintentionally getting into somebody else’s mouth, nose or eyes,” she said. Meanwhile, the European Union on Saturday urged President Donald Trump to rethink his decision to terminate the U.S. relationship with the World Health Organization as spiking infection rates in India and elsewhere reinforced that the pandemic is far from contained. Trump on Friday charged that the WHO didn’t respond adequately to the pandemic and accused the U.N. agency of being under China’s “total control.” The U.S. is the largest source of financial support for the WHO, and its exit is expected to significantly weaken the organization. The head of the EU’s executive arm urged Trump to reconsider. “The WHO needs to continue being able to lead the international response to pandemics, current and future,” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said. German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas told Germany’s Funke media group that Trump’s decision was the “wrong signal at the wrong time.” In China, where the virus outbreak began, only four new confirmed cases were reported Saturday, all brought from outside the country. Nearly 6 million coronavirus infections have been reported worldwide, with more than 366,000 deaths and almost 2.5 million recoveries, according to the Johns Hopkins tally. The true death toll is widely believed to be significantly higher, with experts saying many victims died of the virus without ever being tested for it. Elite sporting events will be allowed to resume in England starting Monday, but without spectators, paving the way for the planned June 17 return of the Premier League, the world’s richest soccer competition. England’s deputy chief medical officer Jonathan Van-Tam warned that the situation overall remained precarious. “I believe this is also a very dangerous moment,” he said. “We have to get this right.” India registered another record single-day jump of 7,964 cases and 265 deaths. The government had been expected to end a 2-month-old nationwide lockdown but instead extended measures in areas due to coronavirus outbreaks. Seewer reported from Toledo, Ohio.

1621135116,2020-05-30 16:50:41,Retreat or deploy? Police try to balance protest response,https://www.sunjournal.com/2020/05/30/retreat-or-deploy-police-try-to-balance-protest-response/,en,False,,68001,sunjournal.com,http://www.sunjournal.com/#spider,"LOS ANGELES — On two straight nights of unruly protests against police brutality, officers retreated from their posts in some American cities, while in others, they deployed batons, flash-bang grenades and tear gas to quell the unrest. The wide range of responses exacerbated tensions with the protesters in several locations and brought global attention to the tactics that American police use during riots as they try to find a balance between keeping the peace and protecting the safety of officers and the public. The protests came in the wake of George Floyd’s death in Minneapolis after a white police officer pressed a knee into the 46-year-old black man’s neck for more than eight minutes on Memorial Day. Floyd was handcuffed as Officer Derek Chauvin pushed his face into the pavement amid his pleas for help. Tensions rose throughout the week and reached a crescendo Friday night as protests erupted in cities across America. On their smart phones, social media feeds and TVs, viewers saw the extremes in tactics play out all through the night Thursday and Friday, even as the majority of cops nationwide tried to keep the peace without retreating or shoving people to the ground. In Minneapolis, leaders decided to evacuate a police precinct Thursday and surrender it to protesters who set it on fire. Protesters also broke into the police headquarters Friday in Portland, Oregon, and ignited a fire. In New York, officers used batons and shoved protesters down as they took people into custody and cleared the streets. One video showed on officer slam a woman to the ground as he walked past her in the street. In Louisville, a police officer fired what appeared to be pepper balls at a news crew, and a clip of the video amassed more than 8 million views on Twitter in less than six hours. Los Angeles police arrested more than 500 protesters on Friday night. Minneapolis police and Mayor Jacob Frey have been sharply criticized for the noticeably non-confrontational strategy Thursday in handling the protests after Floyd’s death. Chauvin was arrested Friday and charged with murder. To some, the act of protesters taking over the evacuated Minneapolis precinct amid fires could stoke further flames. “You’ve got to defend that,” said former Los Angeles Police Deputy Chief Michael Downing. “That’s your command operation. Symbolically, it looks very bad if you have to give that up.” Downing would know: He witnessed the Los Angeles riots firsthand in 1992 following the acquittal of four officers accused of beating black motorist Rodney King. In Los Angeles, the center of the uprising was an intersection, Florence and Normandie avenues, and the violence spiraled into five days of riots and fires. More than 60 people died, including 10 who were fatally shot by law enforcement. In 1992, then-Lt. Downing would typically oversee that intersection, but he was on vacation studying for a promotional exam. A different lieutenant was in charge instead. The lieutenant made a decision: He ordered his officers to abandon the intersection. An hour later, a truck driver would be pulled from his vehicle and be brutally beaten by rioters. “I think that sent a signal to the rest of the city,” said Downing, who immediately rushed to work. “When you have that coupled with political leadership saying ‘show your anger, go to the streets’ it was kind of like permission to go out and misbehave and be violent.” Nearly 30 years later, police officers around the country are confronted with an eerily similar dilemma, with cities aflame, violent protests erupting and another challenging night ahead Saturday as National Guard troops start arriving in some cities. The mere presence of armed National Guard troops on the streets in Minneapolis and elsewhere brings back memories to the civil rights and anti-war protests of the 1960s and ’70s, but they are only there as a support to local law enforcement and do not have the authority to make arrests. They can use their weapons in “self-defense” but are trained in less lethal crowd control tactics that attempt to de-escalate tensions. Alex Vitale, a sociology professor at Brooklyn College, said that when deciding how to manage large protests, police and political leaders look for ways to facilitate “legitimate outpourings of anger” while trying to limit the likelihood of injury and property destruction. But he said the difficulty is trying to strike that balance. “The crisis of police legitimacy has become so great that then to use the police to manage the situation just enflames the problem,” said Vitale, who has studied the policing of protests for two decades. In Minneapolis and other cities around the nation where high-profile police killings of black people have prompted protests, the rage felt by protesters is understandable, said Ed Gonzalez, sheriff of Harris County, Texas. “We keep promising real change but not delivering it on a consistent basis,” he said. “We see the resulting emotions and anger and calls for change that occur, only for it to happen again.” Edward Maguire, a criminology and criminal justice professor at Arizona State University whose research focuses primarily on policing and violence, said mass arrests are almost always a bad idea during protests. But so is not making arrests in the face of violence and property damage. He said police departments should be continuously engaged in building connections with minority communities, faith representatives and social justices leaders so that they have a degree of social capital and open communications when protests break out. In other recent protests, police found themselves in a similar situation as those on the front lines this week. Police were criticized in Baltimore and Charlottesville, Virginia, for taking too much of a hands-off approach during protests in 2015 and 2017. In Minneapolis, Frey said he made the decision to evacuate the third precinct that was later torched because of “imminent threats” to both officers and the public. “Brick and mortar is not as important as life,” Frey said. Even as law enforcement nationwide harshly condemned Chauvin’s actions in unprecedented language earlier in the week, they denounced the violence of the fiery protests and pleaded for calm. “You can’t allow anarchy just because this horrible injustice has occurred,” said Stephen Downing, Michael Downing’s father and also a retired LAPD deputy chief. “You can’t let your city burn. You just can’t.” AP writer Sarah Rankin contributed to this report from Richmond, Virginia. « Previous Next »",0.0

NASA’s Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken rode skyward aboard a sleek, white-and-black, bullet-shaped Dragon capsule on top of a Falcon 9 rocket, lifting off at 3:22 p.m. from the same launch pad used to send the Apollo astronauts to the moon a half-century ago. Minutes later, they safely entered orbit. “Let’s light this candle,” Hurley said just before ignition, borrowing the words used by Alan Shepard on America’s first human spaceflight, in 1961. We have liftoff. History is made as @NASA_Astronauts launch from @NASAKennedy for the first time in nine years on the @SpaceX Crew Dragon: pic.twitter.com/alX1t1JBAt — NASA (@NASA) May 30, 2020 The two men are scheduled to arrive at the International Space Station on Sunday for a stay of up to four months, after which they will return to Earth in a Right Stuff-style splashdown at sea. The mission unfolded amid the gloom of the coronavirus outbreak, which has killed over 100,000 Americans, and racial unrest across the U.S. over the death of George Floyd, a handcuffed black man, at the hands of Minneapolis police. NASA officials and others held out hope the flight would would be a morale-booster. “Maybe there’s an opportunity here for America to maybe pause and look up and see a bright, shining moment of hope at what the future looks like, that the United States of America can do extraordinary things even in difficult times,” NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine said before launch. With the on-time liftoff, SpaceX, founded by Musk, the Tesla electric-car visionary, became the first private company to launch people into orbit, a feat achieved previously by only three governments: the U.S., Russia and China. The flight also ended a nine-year launch drought for NASA, the longest such hiatus in its history. Ever since it retired the space shuttle in 2011, NASA has relied on Russian spaceships launched from Kazakhstan to take U.S. astronauts to and from the space station. In the intervening years, NASA outsourced the job of designing and building its next generation of spaceships to SpaceX and Boeing, awarding them $7 billion in contracts in a public-private partnership aimed at driving down costs and spurring innovation. Boeing’s spaceship, the Starliner capsule, is not expected to fly astronauts until early 2021. Musk said earlier in the week that the project is aimed at “reigniting the dream of space and getting people fired up about the future.” Ultimately, NASA hopes to rely in part on its commercial partners as it works to send astronauts back to the moon in the next few years, and on to Mars in the 2030s. Before setting out for the launch pad in a gull-wing Tesla SUV — another Musk product — Behnken pantomimed a hug of his 6-year-old son, Theo, and said: “Are you going to listen to Mommy and make her life easy?” Hurley blew kisses to his 10-year-old son and wife. A launch attempt on Wednesday was called off with less than 17 minutes to go in the countdown because of lightning. On Saturday, stormy weather in Florida threatened another postponement for most of the day, but then the skies began to clear in the afternoonjust in time. Nine minutes after liftoff, the rocket’s first stage booster landed, as designed, on a barge a few hundred miles off the Florida coast. Inside Kennedy Space Center, attendance was strictly limited because of the coronavirus, and the small crowd of a few thousand was a shadow of what it would have been without the threat of COVID-19. President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence flew in for the event for the second time in four days. By NASA’s count, over 3 million viewers tuned in online. Despite NASA’s insistence that the public stay safe by staying home, spectators gathered along beaches and roads hours in advance. Among them was Neil Wight, a machinist from Buffalo, New York, who staked out a view of the launch pad from a park in Titusville. “It’s pretty historically significant in my book, and a lot of other people’s books. With everything that’s going on in this country right now, it’s important that we do things extraordinary in life,” Wight said. “We’ve been bombarded with doom and gloom for the last six, eight weeks, whatever it is, and this is awesome. It brings a lot of people together.” The astronauts were kept in quasi-quarantine for more than two months before liftoff. The SpaceX technicians who helped them get into their spacesuits wore masks and gloves that made them look like black-clad ninjas. And at the launch center, the SpaceX controllers were seated far apart. Hurley, a 53-year-old retired Marine, and Behnken, 49, an Air Force colonel, are veterans of two space shuttle flights each. Hurley piloted the space shuttle on the last launch of astronauts from Kennedy, on July 8, 2011. In keeping with Musk’s penchant for futuristic flash, the astronauts wore angular white uniforms with black trim. Instead of the usual multitude of dials, knobs and switches, the Dragon capsule has three large touchscreens. SpaceX has been launching cargo capsules to the space station since 2012. In preparation for Wednesday’s flight, SpaceX sent up a Dragon capsule with only a test dummy aboard last year, and it docked smoothly at the orbiting outpost on autopilot, then returned to Earth in a splashdown. During the Mercury, Gemini, Apollo and shuttle programs, NASA relied on aerospace contractors to build spacecraft according to the agency’s designs. NASA owned and operated the ships. Under the new, 21st-century partnership, aerospace companies design, build, own and operate the spaceships, and NASA is essentially a paying customer on a list that could eventually include non-government researchers, artists and tourists. (Tom Cruise has already expressed interest.) “What Elon Musk has done for the American space program is he has brought vision and inspiration that we hadn’t had” since the shuttle’s retirement in 2011, Bridenstine said on the eve of launch. He called the SpaceX chief “brilliant” and said Musk has “absolutely delivered” for NASA. The mission is technically considered by SpaceX and NASA to be a test flight. The next SpaceX voyage to the space station, set for the end of August, will have a full, four-person crew: three Americans and one Japanese. Wednesday’s first human flight was originally targeted for around 2015. But NASA’s commercial crew program encountered bureaucratic delays and technical setbacks. A SpaceX capsule exploded on the test stand last year. Boeing’s first Starliner capsule ended up in the wrong orbit during an crew-less test flight in December and was nearly destroyed at the mission’s end. Both companies had trouble with such things as the landing parachutes. Send questions/comments to the editors. « Previous Next » filed under:",0.0
1621138604,2020-05-30 16:19:58,Israeli police kill unarmed autistic Palestinian man,https://www.centralmaine.com/2020/05/30/israeli-police-kill-unarmed-autistic-palestinian-man/,en,False,,29592,onlinesentinel.com,http://www.onlinesentinel.com#spider,"JERUSALEM — Israeli police shot dead an unarmed autistic Palestinian man in Jerusalem’s Old City on Saturday after mistakenly suspecting he was carrying a weapon. The shooting drew angry condemnations from Arab residents and leaders and further raised tensions in the region as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu presses ahead with plans to annex large parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Relatives identified the deceased man as Iyad Halak, 32. They said he suffered from autism and was heading to the school for students with special needs where he studied each day when he was shot. “They killed him in cold blood,” Halak’s mother told Israel’s Channel 12 TV. In a statement, Israeli police said they spotted a suspect “with a suspicious object that looked like a pistol.” When he failed to obey orders to stop, officers opened fire, the statement said. Police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld later said no weapon was found. Channel 12 said police fired at Halak and chased him into a dead-end alley. It said a senior officer ordered a halt in fire as they entered the alley, but that a second officer did not listen and fired six or seven bullets from an M-16 rifle, killing Halak. The report said both officers were taken into custody and interrogated for several hours. AP video from the scene showed three bullet holes in a white wall at the end of the alleyway. Halak’s father, Kheiri, said police raided the family’s home after the shooting. “They found nothing,” he said, claiming that police had cursed his daughter when she became upset at them. Lone Palestinian attackers with no clear links to armed groups have carried out a series of stabbings, shootings and car-ramming attacks in recent years. Palestinians and Israeli human rights groups have long accused Israeli security forces of using excessive force in some cases, either by killing individuals who could have been arrested or using lethal force when their lives were not in danger. “We must resist the expected cover-up and make sure that the police will sit in jail,” Ayman Odeh, the leader of the main Arab party in parliament, wrote on Twitter. “Justice will be done only when the Halak family, their friends and the rest of the Palestinian people know freedom and independence.” On social media, some pro-Palestinian activists compared the shooting to this week’s death of George Floyd, the Minnesota man whose death in police custody has set off violent protests across the U.S. Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid, whose daughter is autistic, said Halak’s death was “heartbreaking.” “The death of a young person with special needs is heartbreaking and all of Israel bows their heads. This is not our way,” he tweeted. In west Jerusalem, about 150 protesters, some pounding drums, gathered to demonstrate against police violence. “A violent policeman must stay inside,” they chanted. At a smaller protest in Tel Aviv, one poster read “Palestinian lives matter.” The shooting came a day after Israeli soldiers killed a Palestinian in the occupied West Bank who they said had tried to ram them with his vehicle. No Israelis were wounded in either incident. Saturday’s shooting occurred in east Jerusalem, which Israel captured in the 1967 war along with the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. The Palestinians want all three territories for their future state. Tensions have risen in recent weeks as Israel has pressed ahead with plans to annex large parts of the West Bank in line with President Donald Trump’s Middle East plan, which strongly favors Israel and was rejected by the Palestinians. Netanyahu has said he plans on moving ahead with the plan in July. The Palestinian Authority, which governs autonomous enclaves in the West Bank, said last week that it was no longer bound by past agreements with Israel and the United States and was cutting off all ties, including longstanding security coordination, to protest the annexation plan. The Trump plan would allow the Palestinians to establish a capital on the outskirts of the city, beyond Israel’s separation barrier. It would grant them limited statehood in a cluster of enclaves surrounded by Israel, but only if they meet a long list of stringent conditions. The annexation plan has also drawn widespread condemnations from Israeli allies in Europe and across the Arab world. Send questions/comments to the editors. « Previous Next »",0.0
1621141351,2020-05-30 17:02:43,Minnesota offered use of active-duty military to quell unrest,https://www.pressherald.com/2020/05/30/minnesota-offered-use-of-active-duty-military-to-quell-unrest/,en,False,,366984,pressherald.com,http://pressherald.com/,"WASHINGTON — The Pentagon said Saturday it was ready to provide military help to authorities scrambling to contain unrest in Minneapolis, where George Floyd’s death has sparked widespread protests, but Gov. Tim Walz has not requested federal troops. Jonathan Rath Hoffman, the chief Pentagon spokesman, said several military units have been placed on higher alert “as a prudent planning measure” in case Walz asks for help. The Associated Press first reported on the potential deployments and, citing sources with direct knowledge of the orders, named four locations from which soldiers would be drawn. Hoffman did not identify the units, but other officials said they are mainly military police. Hoffman said these are units normally on 48-hour recall to support state authorities in the event of crises like natural disasters. They are now on four-hour alert, Hoffman said. Defense officials said there was no intent by the Pentagon to deploy any federal forces to Minnesota unless Walz asked for help. If he did make such a request, federal units such as military police could provide logistical and other kinds of support to the Minnesota National Guard or state law enforcement, but would not get directly involved in law enforcement under current plans, the officials said. They were not authorized to discuss the planning publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. Hoffman said Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, had spoken to Walz twice in the past 24 hours and told him the Pentagon was prepared to help if needed. Maj. Gen. Jon Jensen, the adjutant general of the Minnesota National Guard, said the Pentagon’s decision to place some military units on a higher state of alert for potential deployment was “a prudent move” that gave Walz more options. Earlier, Alyssa Farah, the White House director of strategic communications, told the AP that the deployment of active-duty military police to Minnesota was untrue. In an email, she referred to Title 10, the U.S. law that governs the armed forces and would authorize active duty military to operate within the country. “False: off the record – title 10 not under discussion,” said Farah. No off-record agreement was negotiated with the AP. President Donald Trump urged Walz and other authorities in Minnesota to “be tough” in Minneapolis. “We have our military ready, willing and able if they ever want to call our military, and we can have troops on the ground every quickly,” Trump said. Soldiers from Fort Bragg in North Carolina and Fort Drum in New York have been ordered to be ready to deploy within four hours if called, according to three people with direct knowledge of the orders. Soldiers in Fort Carson, in Colorado, and Fort Riley in Kansas have been told to be ready within 24 hours. The people were not were not authorized to discuss the preparations publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. The get-ready orders were sent verbally on Friday, after Trump asked Esper for military options to help quell the unrest in Minneapolis after protests descended into looting and arson in some parts of the city. Trump made the request on a phone call from the Oval Office on Thursday night that included Esper, national security advisor Robert O’ Brien and several others. The president asked Esper for rapid deployment options if the Minneapolis protests continued to spiral out of control, according to one of the people, a senior Pentagon official who was on the call. The person said the military units would be deployed under the Insurrection Act of 1807, which was last used in 1992 during the riots in Los Angeles that followed the Rodney King trial. Another official said Saturday, however, that federal troops could be deployed to Minnesota without invoking that act. In that situation, they would perform non-law enforcement duties such as providing logistics help. “If this is where the president is headed response-wise, it would represent a significant escalation and a determination that the various state and local authorities are not up to the task of responding to the growing unrest,” said Brad Moss, a Washington D.C.-based attorney, who specializes in national security. Members of the police units were on a 30-minute recall alert early Saturday, meaning they would have to return to their bases inside that time limit in preparation for deployment to Minneapolis inside of four hours. Units at Fort Drum are set to head to Minneapolis first, according to the three people, including two Defense Department officials. Roughly 800 U.S. soldiers would deploy to the city if called. Protests erupted in Minneapolis this week after video emerged showing a police officer pressing his knee into Floyd’s neck for several minutes even after Floyd stopping moving and pleading for air. Floyd later died of his injuries. The officer, Derek Chauvin, was arrested and charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter on Friday. The protests turned violent and on Thursday rioters torched the Minneapolis Third Police Precinct near where Floyd was arrested. Mayor Jacob Frey ordered a citywide curfew at 8 p.m. local time, beginning on Friday. In that city, peaceful protests picked up steam as darkness fell, with thousands of people ignoring the curfew to walk streets in the southern part of the city. Some cars were set on fire in scattered neighborhoods, business break-ins began and eventually there were larger fires. Active-duty forces are normally prohibited from acting as a domestic law enforcement agency. But the Insurrection Act offers an exception. There was no indication Saturday that Trump intended to invoke that act. It would allow the military to take up a policing authority it otherwise would not be allowed to do, enforcing state and federal laws, said Stephen Vladeck, a University of Texas School of Law professor who specializes in constitutional and national security law. The statute “is deliberately vague” when it comes to the instances in which the Insurrection Act could be used, he said. The state’s governor could ask Trump to take action or Trump could act on his own authority if he’s determined that the local authorities are so overwhelmed that they can’t adequately enforce the law, Vladeck said. “It is a very, very broad grant of authority for the president,” he added.",0.0
1621151758,2020-05-30 17:39:01,Minnesota governor: Unrest no longer about George Floyd murder,https://www.pressherald.com/2020/05/30/minnesota-governor-unrest-no-longer-about-george-floyd-murder/,en,False,,366984,pressherald.com,http://pressherald.com/,"WASHINGTON — As protests over the death of George Floyd grow in cities across the U.S., government officials have been warning of the “outsiders” – groups of organized rioters they say are flooding into major cities not to call for justice but to cause destruction. But the state and federal officials have offered differing assessments of who the outsiders are. They’ve blamed left-wing extremists, far-right white nationalists and even suggested the involvement of drug cartels. These leaders have offered little evidence to back up those claims, and the chaos of the protests makes verifying identities and motives exceedingly difficult. Police officers across the country were gearing up Saturday for another night of potentially violent clashes in major cities. Some states had even called in the National Guard to aid overwhelmed police. The finger pointing on both sides of the political spectrum is likely to deepen the political divide in the U.S., allowing politicians to advance the theory that aligns with their political view and distract from the underlying frustrations that triggered the protests. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz on Saturday told reporters he’d heard unconfirmed reports that white supremacists were coming from elsewhere to stoke the violence and that even drug cartels “are trying to take advantage of the chaos.” John Harrington, the state’s commissioner of public safety, later said they had received intel reports on white supremacists. “But I cannot say that we have confirmed observations of local law enforcement to say that we’ve seen cells of white supremacists in the area,” he said Saturday. But federal officials later pointed to “far left extremist groups.” President Donald Trump alleged the violence was “being led by Antifa and other radical groups.” Antifa, short for anti-fascists, is an umbrella term for far-left-leaning militant groups that resist neo-Nazis and white supremacists at demonstrations. Attorney General William Barr later seemed to echo Trump’s assertion, saying the violent incidents in Minneapolis were driven by groups using “Antifa-like tactics.” Barr vowed that federal prosecutors across the country would use federal riots statutes to charge protesters who cross state lines to participate in violent rioting. A Justice Department spokesperson said the attorney general’s assertion was based on information provided from state and local law enforcement agencies, but did not detail what that information entailed. Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf was even more vague, declining to point to any particular ideology in his assessment. His agency has heard that “a number of different groups are involved in these whether it’s Antifa or it’s others, frankly,” he said. The groups appeared to be organized and using tactics that wouldn’t normally happen in peaceful protest, he said, though he didn’t elaborate. While the motives behind the violence were unclear, there was firmer evidence that some of the protesters were coming to the demonstrations from outside the urban centers that have been the epicenter of the demonstrations. In New York City, federal officials were bringing charges against several suspects, including one of two sisters from upstate New York accused of throwing a Molotov cocktail through the back window of a police van in Brooklyn, a law enforcement official said. The initially peaceful demonstrations in New York City over Floyd’s death spiraled into chaos as night fell Friday. Protesters confronted police officers, destroying police vehicles and setting fires. In Detroit, 37 of the 60 people who were arrested in overnight protests did not live in the city — and many came from nearby suburbs, police Chief James Craig said Saturday. Although Detroit is about 80% black, many of those arrested were white. “We support the right to free speech. We support peaceful protests,” Craig told reporters. “If you want to disrupt, stay home and disrupt in your own community.” Initially, St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter said he’d been told all of those arrested in his city Friday were from outside the state. But a spokesman said Saturday night the mayor had later learned more than half are from Minnesota. In Hennepin County, which includes Minneapolis, 47 of the 57 people arrested in protest incidents through Saturday morning had provided a Minnesota address to authorities, according to Jeremy Zoss, a spokesman for the Hennepin County Sheriff’s Office. Carter expressed the opinion of many black activists in the Twin Cities who have expressed disbelief that local residents would destroy their own neighborhoods, burning down essential services and damaging small businesses. And while it was local protesters and groups that staged initial angry, but peaceful, demonstrations, it was agitators from elsewhere that strategically escalated the tension by causing damage and setting fires, they said. Their beliefs were reinforced by the large numbers of white people in the protests in Minneapolis. “I think about a third of the people are from out of town here to make the city burn,” said Justin Terrell, executive director of the Council for Minnesotans of African Heritage. “It is just putting black people in a crossfire not just between fascists and anarchists — but putting us in a crossfire with the national guard.” It’s exceedingly difficult in the chaos and dark of the events to prove these claims. The challenge is made harder in the Minnesota protest, where very few arrests were made in the first two nights of unrest. St. Paul arrest records showed 18 people were arrested on charges related to civil unrest from Thursday to early Saturday morning. Of those, only four were from outside the state; two were listed as unknown. Still, some civil rights leaders had a clear message for anyone coming to protest, even those who show up to call for justice for Floyd. “The moment has passed. Go home, stay away from here. We are a vulnerable population. At the end of that day if black folks can’t rebuild then the only thing we’ve done is build more power for white folks,” said Terrell. “You’re talking about years, decades of work undone by these groups — and by the officer.” Trump vowed Saturday that the “radical left criminals, thugs and others” would “not be allowed to set communities ablaze.” “I will not allow angry mobs to dominate,” he said. “Won’t happen.” Hennessey reported from Minneapolis.

National Guard was called in as pockets of violence erupted during a second straight night of protests over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis and President Trump’s response to it. Hundreds of people converged on the White House and marched along the National Mall, chanting “Black Lives Matter,” “I can’t breathe” and “No justice, no peace.” Protesters dragged away barricades and some broke up concrete to use as projectiles. At one point, a trash bin was set on fire. The D.C. demonstration was one of several around the country protesting Floyd’s death. Trump appeared to cheer on the tougher tactics being used by law enforcement to disperse protesters Saturday night. He commended National Guard troops deployed in Minneapolis, declaring “No games!” and he also said police in New York City “must be allowed to do their job!” “Let New York’s Finest be New York’s Finest,” Trump said on Twitter after returning to the White House from Florida, where he watched the launch of a SpaceX rocket. He did not talk to reporters upon his return and it was not clear if he could hear the protest over the sound of his helicopter. But for at least part of the flight, televisions on Air Force One were turned to Fox News and its coverage of the protests. Earlier in the day, he had belittled the protesters and claimed that many Secret Service agents were “just waiting for action” and ready to unleash “the most vicious dogs, and the most ominous weapons, I have ever seen” if protesters crossed the White House’s security fence. He pledged later to “stop mob violence.” “I stand before you as a friend and ally to every American seeking justice and peace, and I stand before you in firm opposition to anyone exploiting this tragedy to loot, rob, attack and menace,” the president said after watching the launch of a SpaceX rocket. “Healing, not hatred, justice, not chaos, are the missions at hand.” There were multiple incidents of protesters pushing against barricades and being repelled with pepper spray. Police were in tactical gear. The D.C. National Guard was activated at the direction of the secretary of the Army after a request from the Park Police to help maintain order near the White House, Commanding Gen. William J. Walker said in a post on the Guard’s Facebook page. “We’re sick of it. The cops are out of control,” protester Olga Hall said. “They’re wild. There’s just been too many dead boys,” she said. During one confrontation, protesters took down a barrier and one person threw an electric scooter at the police. An activist wearing a Black Lives Matter T-shirt put himself between police and the protesters and yelled, “Stop. This is what they want.” Speaking over a megaphone earlier in the evening, Cameron McCall said, “We don’t need violence. All we need are our voices.” While some protesters stayed near the White House, others marched through the streets chanting, “No justice and no peace.” and “Say his name: George Floyd.” The mood was angry and several speakers implored marchers to remain peaceful. At multiple stops along the march, protesters verbally abused lines of uniformed police officers with riot shields. The march paused between the the Washington Monument and the African-American Museum and demonstrators sat down in the street for a nine-minute moment of silence for the nine minutes that the Minneapolis police officer knelt on George Floyd’s neck. . At the Lincoln Memorial, one organizer spoke over a megaphone “Look to the left and to the right and thank that person. We can’t hug anybody because of COVID but I love you anyway.” Many of the protesters wore masks, but did not socially distance themselves. Another group circled through the Capitol Hill neighborhood for at least an hour in cars, honking. A helicopter hovered overhead. During an earlier skirmish, protesters threw bottles and eggs at Secret Service officers on the edge of Lafayette Square and pepper spray was used to disperse them, according to a reporter for radio station WTOP. “After a long stalemate the Secret Service, in full tactical gear, pushed forward and cleared the intersection, and there was a cloud of pepper spray and people ran backwards as fast as they could. It was almost a mad stampede,” said WTOP digital editor Alejandro Alvarez. In a series of tweets earlier Saturday, Trump doubted their allegiance to Floyd’s memory, saying they were “professionally managed.” He offered no evidence to back his assertion, and the president even seemed to invite supporters to make their presence felt: “Tonight, I understand, is MAGA NIGHT AT THE WHITE HOUSE???” Trump later rejected the suggestion that he was stoking a potential conflict between protesters and his supporters. “I was just asking. But I have no idea if they are going to be here,” he said. “MAGA is Make America Great Again. By the way, they love African American people. They love black people.” At Saturday’s demonstration, there was no evidence of a counter-move by Trump supporters. Trump said he had “watched every move” from inside the executive mansion during Friday’s protest and “couldn’t have felt more safe” as the Secret Service let the protesters carry on, “but whenever someone … got too frisky or out of line, they would quickly come down on then, hard — didn’t know what hit them.” The president also criticized the mayors of Washington and Minneapolis. Trump said Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey “is probably a very good person, but he’s a radical, left mayor.” He then described how he watched as a police station in the city was overrun. “For that police station to be abandoned and taken over, I’ve never seen anything so horrible and stupid in my life,” Trump said when speaking briefly to reporters at the White House. He said Minnesota officials have to get tougher with rioters, and that by doing so they would be honoring the memory of Floyd. The Secret Service said in a statement Saturday that six protesters were arrested in Washington and “multiple” officers were injured. There were no details on the charges or nature of the injuries. A spokesman for U.S. Park Police said their officers made no arrests, but several suffered minor injuries and one was taken to a hospital after being struck in the helmet by a projectile. Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf on Saturday called the protesters “criminals” who committed “acts of violence while hiding behind their First Amendment right of lawful protest.” Wolf said the Secret Service was “evolving and adapting to the changing nature of the threats they face.” Floyd is the black man who was being held in handcuffs when he died Monday in Minneapolis after a police officer pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes even after Floyd stopped moving and pleading for air. Protests have erupted in U.S. cities in the days since. As he tweeted, Trump claimed that many Secret Service agents were “just waiting for action” and ready to unleash “the most vicious dogs, and the most ominous weapons, I have ever seen.” His reference to “vicious dogs” potentially being sicced on protesters revisits images from the civil rights movement when marchers faced snarling police dogs and high-pressure fire hoses. In a news conference Saturday afternoon, Muriel Bowser, mayor of the nation’s capital, called Trump’s remark’s “gross” and said the reference to attack dogs conjures up with the worst memories of the nation’s fight against segregation. “I call upon our city and our nation to exercise restraint, great restraint, even as the president tries to divide us,” she said. “I feel like these comments are an attack on humanity, an attack on black America, and they make my city less safe.” In contrast with the president’s tweets, the Secret Service said it “respects the right to assemble and we ask that individuals do so peacefully for the safety of all.” In protests that stretched into the early hours Saturday, people hurled pieces of bricks, bottles and other objects at Secret Service and Park Police officers who were in riot gear behind barricades around the White House. Protesters at times kicked and punched officers and wrestled over the barricades. As some in the crowd grew more aggressive, police deployed pepper spray to keep them back and maintain a perimeter of officers around the White House. The protest went on for hours before police declared the gathering “unlawful” and ordered everyone to leave Lafayette Square, a seven-acre public park located directly north of the White House. Dozens of officers pushed forward with their shields and fired off streams of pepper spray at protesters. “Out of the park or you will be sprayed,” an officer shouted at the crowd.

The Oakland shooting occurred after a vehicle pulled up outside the Ronald V. Dellums Federal Building at about 9:45 p.m. Friday. Someone opened fire at two contract security officers who worked for Homeland Security’s Federal Protective Service, killing one and critically wounding the other, authorities said. The officers protect federal court houses as part of their regular duties. DHS officials said they were monitoring the Oakland protest over the police killing of George Floyd in Minnesota. The identities of the officers have not been released. A suspect hasn’t been named and it wasn’t immediately known whether authorities have determined if the shooting was connected with the protest. Federal officials said they’re seeing more threats and assaults against law enforcement officers at protests and said they will step up security measures to protect them. “There are currently threats by some to attack police stations and federal buildings, Cuccinelli said. “That violence not only won’t be tolerated, we are also committed to ensuring that it won’t succeed anywhere, anywhere.” The protest in downtown Oakland began peacefully but spiraled into chaos late into the night. Some demonstrators smashed windows, set fires and threw objects at officers. Police said 13 officers were injured. The federal building’s glass doors were smashed and the front entrance was sprayed with anti-police graffiti. California Sen. Dianne Feinstein condemned the violence, “We have to know right from wrong and not use the terrible tragedy in Minneapolis to perpetrate more violence.” she said “There’s never an excuse to shoot and kill a security guard, destroy businesses or injure innocent people.” « Previous Next »",0.0

Another group circled through the Capitol Hill neighborhood for at least an hour in cars, honking. A helicopter hovered overhead. During an earlier skirmish, protesters threw bottles and eggs at Secret Service officers on the edge of Lafayette Square and pepper spray was used to disperse them, according to a reporter for radio station WTOP. “After a long stalemate the Secret Service, in full tactical gear, pushed forward and cleared the intersection, and there was a cloud of pepper spray and people ran backwards as fast as they could. It was almost a mad stampede,” said WTOP digital editor Alejandro Alvarez. In a series of tweets earlier Saturday, Trump doubted their allegiance to Floyd’s memory, saying they were “professionally managed.” He offered no evidence to back his assertion, and the president even seemed to invite supporters to make their presence felt: “Tonight, I understand, is MAGA NIGHT AT THE WHITE HOUSE???” Trump later rejected the suggestion that he was stoking a potential conflict between protesters and his supporters. “I was just asking. But I have no idea if they are going to be here,” he said. “MAGA is Make America Great Again. By the way, they love African American people. They love black people.” At Saturday’s demonstration, there was no evidence of a counter-move by Trump supporters. Trump said he had “watched every move” from inside the executive mansion during Friday’s protest and “couldn’t have felt more safe” as the Secret Service let the protesters carry on, “but whenever someone … got too frisky or out of line, they would quickly come down on then, hard — didn’t know what hit them.” The president also criticized the mayors of Washington and Minneapolis. Trump said Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey “is probably a very good person, but he’s a radical, left mayor.” He then described how he watched as a police station in the city was overrun. “For that police station to be abandoned and taken over, I’ve never seen anything so horrible and stupid in my life,” Trump said when speaking briefly to reporters at the White House. He said Minnesota officials have to get tougher with rioters, and that by doing so they would be honoring the memory of Floyd. The Secret Service said in a statement Saturday that six protesters were arrested in Washington and “multiple” officers were injured. There were no details on the charges or nature of the injuries. A spokesman for U.S. Park Police said their officers made no arrests, but several suffered minor injuries and one was taken to a hospital after being struck in the helmet by a projectile. Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf on Saturday called the protesters “criminals” who committed “acts of violence while hiding behind their First Amendment right of lawful protest.” Wolf said the Secret Service was “evolving and adapting to the changing nature of the threats they face.” Floyd is the black man who was being held in handcuffs when he died Monday in Minneapolis after a police officer pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes even after Floyd stopped moving and pleading for air. Protests have erupted in U.S. cities in the days since. As he tweeted, Trump claimed that many Secret Service agents were “just waiting for action” and ready to unleash “the most vicious dogs, and the most ominous weapons, I have ever seen.” His reference to “vicious dogs” potentially being sicced on protesters revisits images from the civil rights movement when marchers faced snarling police dogs and high-pressure fire hoses. In a news conference Saturday afternoon, Muriel Bowser, mayor of the nation’s capital, called Trump’s remark’s “gross” and said the reference to attack dogs conjures up with the worst memories of the nation’s fight against segregation. “I call upon our city and our nation to exercise restraint, great restraint, even as the president tries to divide us,” she said. “I feel like these comments are an attack on humanity, an attack on black America, and they make my city less safe.” In contrast with the president’s tweets, the Secret Service said it “respects the right to assemble and we ask that individuals do so peacefully for the safety of all.” In protests that stretched into the early hours Saturday, people hurled pieces of bricks, bottles and other objects at Secret Service and Park Police officers who were in riot gear behind barricades around the White House. Protesters at times kicked and punched officers and wrestled over the barricades. As some in the crowd grew more aggressive, police deployed pepper spray to keep them back and maintain a perimeter of officers around the White House. The protest went on for hours before police declared the gathering “unlawful” and ordered everyone to leave Lafayette Square, a seven-acre public park located directly north of the White House. Dozens of officers pushed forward with their shields and fired off streams of pepper spray at protesters. “Out of the park or you will be sprayed,” an officer shouted at the crowd.

1621165605,2020-05-30 17:58:21,Minnesota governor: Unrest no longer about George Floyd murder,https://www.sunjournal.com/2020/05/30/minnesota-governor-unrest-no-longer-about-george-floyd-murder/,en,False,,68001,sunjournal.com,http://www.sunjournal.com/#spider,"WASHINGTON — As protests over the death of George Floyd grow in cities across the U.S., government officials have been warning of the “outsiders” – groups of organized rioters they say are flooding into major cities not to call for justice but to cause destruction. But the state and federal officials have offered differing assessments of who the outsiders are. They’ve blamed left-wing extremists, far-right white nationalists and even suggested the involvement of drug cartels. These leaders have offered little evidence to back up those claims, and the chaos of the protests makes verifying identities and motives exceedingly difficult. Police officers across the country were gearing up Saturday for another night of potentially violent clashes in major cities. Some states had even called in the National Guard to aid overwhelmed police. The finger pointing on both sides of the political spectrum is likely to deepen the political divide in the U.S., allowing politicians to advance the theory that aligns with their political view and distract from the underlying frustrations that triggered the protests. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz on Saturday told reporters he’d heard unconfirmed reports that white supremacists were coming from elsewhere to stoke the violence and that even drug cartels “are trying to take advantage of the chaos.” John Harrington, the state’s commissioner of public safety, later said they had received intel reports on white supremacists. “But I cannot say that we have confirmed observations of local law enforcement to say that we’ve seen cells of white supremacists in the area,” he said Saturday. But federal officials later pointed to “far left extremist groups.” President Donald Trump alleged the violence was “being led by Antifa and other radical groups.” Antifa, short for anti-fascists, is an umbrella term for far-left-leaning militant groups that resist neo-Nazis and white supremacists at demonstrations. Attorney General William Barr later seemed to echo Trump’s assertion, saying the violent incidents in Minneapolis were driven by groups using “Antifa-like tactics.” Barr vowed that federal prosecutors across the country would use federal riots statutes to charge protesters who cross state lines to participate in violent rioting. A Justice Department spokesperson said the attorney general’s assertion was based on information provided from state and local law enforcement agencies, but did not detail what that information entailed. Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf was even more vague, declining to point to any particular ideology in his assessment. His agency has heard that “a number of different groups are involved in these whether it’s Antifa or it’s others, frankly,” he said. The groups appeared to be organized and using tactics that wouldn’t normally happen in peaceful protest, he said, though he didn’t elaborate. While the motives behind the violence were unclear, there was firmer evidence that some of the protesters were coming to the demonstrations from outside the urban centers that have been the epicenter of the demonstrations. In New York City, federal officials were bringing charges against several suspects, including one of two sisters from upstate New York accused of throwing a Molotov cocktail through the back window of a police van in Brooklyn, a law enforcement official said. The initially peaceful demonstrations in New York City over Floyd’s death spiraled into chaos as night fell Friday. Protesters confronted police officers, destroying police vehicles and setting fires. In Detroit, 37 of the 60 people who were arrested in overnight protests did not live in the city — and many came from nearby suburbs, police Chief James Craig said Saturday. Although Detroit is about 80% black, many of those arrested were white. “We support the right to free speech. We support peaceful protests,” Craig told reporters. “If you want to disrupt, stay home and disrupt in your own community.” Initially, St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter said he’d been told all of those arrested in his city Friday were from outside the state. But a spokesman said Saturday night the mayor had later learned more than half are from Minnesota. In Hennepin County, which includes Minneapolis, 47 of the 57 people arrested in protest incidents through Saturday morning had provided a Minnesota address to authorities, according to Jeremy Zoss, a spokesman for the Hennepin County Sheriff’s Office. Carter expressed the opinion of many black activists in the Twin Cities who have expressed disbelief that local residents would destroy their own neighborhoods, burning down essential services and damaging small businesses. And while it was local protesters and groups that staged initial angry, but peaceful, demonstrations, it was agitators from elsewhere that strategically escalated the tension by causing damage and setting fires, they said. Their beliefs were reinforced by the large numbers of white people in the protests in Minneapolis. “I think about a third of the people are from out of town here to make the city burn,” said Justin Terrell, executive director of the Council for Minnesotans of African Heritage. “It is just putting black people in a crossfire not just between fascists and anarchists — but putting us in a crossfire with the national guard.” It’s exceedingly difficult in the chaos and dark of the events to prove these claims. The challenge is made harder in the Minnesota protest, where very few arrests were made in the first two nights of unrest. St. Paul arrest records showed 18 people were arrested on charges related to civil unrest from Thursday to early Saturday morning. Of those, only four were from outside the state; two were listed as unknown. Still, some civil rights leaders had a clear message for anyone coming to protest, even those who show up to call for justice for Floyd. “The moment has passed. Go home, stay away from here. We are a vulnerable population. At the end of that day if black folks can’t rebuild then the only thing we’ve done is build more power for white folks,” said Terrell. “You’re talking about years, decades of work undone by these groups — and by the officer.” Trump vowed Saturday that the “radical left criminals, thugs and others” would “not be allowed to set communities ablaze.” “I will not allow angry mobs to dominate,” he said. “Won’t happen.” Hennessey reported from Minneapolis.

1621270230,2020-05-31 00:12:54,Protesters converge on White House for second straight day,https://www.pressherald.com/2020/05/31/protesters-converge-on-white-house-for-second-straight-day/,en,False,,366984,pressherald.com,http://pressherald.com/,"WASHINGTON — Police fired pepper spray at demonstrators near the White House and the D.C. National Guard was called in as pockets of violence erupted during a second straight night of protests over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis and President Trump’s response to it. Hundreds of people converged on the White House and marched along the National Mall, chanting “Black Lives Matter,” “I can’t breathe” and “No justice, no peace.” Protesters dragged away barricades and some broke up concrete to use as projectiles. At one point, a trash bin was set on fire. The D.C. demonstration was one of several around the country protesting Floyd’s death. Trump appeared to cheer on the tougher tactics being used by law enforcement to disperse protesters Saturday night. He commended National Guard troops deployed in Minneapolis, declaring “No games!” and he also said police in New York City “must be allowed to do their job!” “Let New York’s Finest be New York’s Finest,” Trump said on Twitter after returning to the White House from Florida, where he watched the launch of a SpaceX rocket. He did not talk to reporters upon his return and it was not clear if he could hear the protest over the sound of his helicopter. But for at least part of the flight, televisions on Air Force One were turned to Fox News and its coverage of the protests. Earlier in the day, he had belittled the protesters and claimed that many Secret Service agents were “just waiting for action” and ready to unleash “the most vicious dogs, and the most ominous weapons, I have ever seen” if protesters crossed the White House’s security fence. He pledged later to “stop mob violence.” “I stand before you as a friend and ally to every American seeking justice and peace, and I stand before you in firm opposition to anyone exploiting this tragedy to loot, rob, attack and menace,” the president said after watching the launch of a SpaceX rocket. “Healing, not hatred, justice, not chaos, are the missions at hand.” There were multiple incidents of protesters pushing against barricades and being repelled with pepper spray. Police were in tactical gear. The D.C. National Guard was activated at the direction of the secretary of the Army after a request from the Park Police to help maintain order near the White House, Commanding Gen. William J. Walker said in a post on the Guard’s Facebook page. “We’re sick of it. The cops are out of control,” protester Olga Hall said. “They’re wild. There’s just been too many dead boys,” she said. During one confrontation, protesters took down a barrier and one person threw an electric scooter at the police. An activist wearing a Black Lives Matter T-shirt put himself between police and the protesters and yelled, “Stop. This is what they want.” Speaking over a megaphone earlier in the evening, Cameron McCall said, “We don’t need violence. All we need are our voices.” While some protesters stayed near the White House, others marched through the streets chanting, “No justice and no peace.” and “Say his name: George Floyd.” The mood was angry and several speakers implored marchers to remain peaceful. At multiple stops along the march, protesters verbally abused lines of uniformed police officers with riot shields. The march paused between the the Washington Monument and the African-American Museum and demonstrators sat down in the street for a nine-minute moment of silence for the nine minutes that the Minneapolis police officer knelt on George Floyd’s neck. . At the Lincoln Memorial, one organizer spoke over a megaphone “Look to the left and to the right and thank that person. We can’t hug anybody because of COVID but I love you anyway.” Many of the protesters wore masks, but did not socially distance themselves. Another group circled through the Capitol Hill neighborhood for at least an hour in cars, honking. A helicopter hovered overhead. During an earlier skirmish, protesters threw bottles and eggs at Secret Service officers on the edge of Lafayette Square and pepper spray was used to disperse them, according to a reporter for radio station WTOP. “After a long stalemate the Secret Service, in full tactical gear, pushed forward and cleared the intersection, and there was a cloud of pepper spray and people ran backwards as fast as they could.

The move came Friday, hours after the U.S. Department of Justice said it filed court papers in support of campground operators. The campgrounds sued in federal court saying they believe the rule treats Maine residents more favorably than out-of-state residents, and that is hurting them economically. U.S. District Judge Lance Walker on Friday denied a motion for a preliminary injunction, allowing the rule to stand while the lawsuit proceeds, the Portland Press Herald reported. Gov. Janet Mills, a Democrat, said the quarantine is ""a proven tool to prevent the spread of this deadly disease"" and said the Justice Department is ""making a concerted effort to undermine the health of the people of Maine."" Mills said Saturday restaurants in Androscoggin, Cumberland and York counties that she told to delay opening can sell their excess food to prisons. Mills plans to start the second phase of the state's reopening on June 1 but said restaurants in those counties won't be able to open that day. She said the Maine Department of Corrections commissioner has agreed to purchase excess food from restaurants in those areas, WMTE reported. On Saturday, Maine reported four more deaths from COVID-19 for a total of 89. The state also reported 56 new coronavirus cases, raising its total to 2,282 New Hampshire The head of a group that represents New Hampshire nursing homes is begging the public to wear face coverings to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. Brendan Williams, president of the New Hampshire Health Care Association, says he supports Nashua's ordinance requiring face masks in public. ""Considerable sacrifice was demanded of Americans in winning World War II. Are we now unwilling to wear masks, or socially distance, to save those who lived through World War II?"" he said in a statement. Department of Health and Human Services Commissioner Lori Shibinette said May 6 that all nursing home residents would be tested within two weeks. On Friday, she said about 95% had been tested. Staff testing was expected to be completed over the weekend. New Hampshire on Saturday announced four additional COVID-19-related deaths. All were age 60 or older and all were in Hillsborough County. The state also announced 55 new positive test results for COVID-19, bringing the state’s total to 4,545. There were nine new hospitalized cases, keeping the state’s rate of hospitalization at 10%. Of the cases on Saturday with complete information, four were age 18 or younger. The new cases live in Hillsborough County other than Manchester and Nashua (10), Merrimack (7), Rockingham (7), Belknap (2), Carroll (1), Grafton (1), and Strafford (1) counties, and in Manchester (13) and Nashua (12). Through Saturday, the state has conducted 70,280 detection tests and 11,468 antibody tests. Massachusetts City officials in Boston are concerned many Asian American residents may not be getting tested for the new coronavirus. Boston's Chinatown zip code, where half the residents are of Asian descent, is one of city neighborhoods with the lowest percentage of positive coronavirus cases, Marty Martinez, the city's chief of Health and Human Services told the Boston Globe. Only 13% of those tested were positive, compared to the citywide cumulative percentage of 26%. Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders make up just less than 10% of Boston's population but account for only 4% of confirmed COVID-19 cases and 6% of deaths, according the newspaper. At the same time, black residents, who comprise 25% of the city's population, account for 38% of COVID-19 infections and 35% of deaths, in cases where the race and ethnicity is known. Latinos make up nearly 20% of the Boston population and account for 25% of cases and 11% of deaths. Paul Watanabe, a political science professor and director of the Institute for Asian American Studies at the University of Massachusetts Boston who is on the mayor's COVID-19 Health Inequities Task Force, thinks the numbers, though incomplete, show a low level of testing among Boston's Asian American population. The percentage of deaths may indicate those Asian Americans with COVID-19 are getting tested late. ""It suggests people might be contracting the illness, unknown that they got it, and going straight to death... without having their situation diagnosed through a positive test or being dealt with, more importantly,"" Watanabe said. Connecticut Health care workers rallied in New London Saturday to protest what they called a shortage of personal protective equipment and pay tribute to a nurse's aide who died earlier this month after contracting the coronavirus. Gov. Ned Lamont, Lt. Gov. Susan Bysiewicz and U.S. Rep. Joe Courtney, D-Conn., joined workers at Lawrence + Memorial Hospital and the Visiting Nurses Association of Southeastern Connecticut for the rally. Union leaders said nurses, aides and other health care workers are risking their lives caring for COVID-19 patients while lacking sufficient protective gear to keep them safe. People at the rally remembered Elva Graveline, a 52-year-old nurse's aide at Lawrence + Memorial who contracted the coronavirus and died May 19.

The nation is being rocked by the May 25 death of George Floyd in Minneapolis seemingly at the hands of police, and the resulting protests – and in some cases riots. Four Minneapolis police officers involved in the arrest have been fired. One of them, Derek Chauvin was arrested and charged Friday with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter in Floyd’s death. “I believe that when justice isn’t served the people are going to react,” Whitted said. People started gathering at Veteran’s Memorial Park Saturday morning ahead of the march, ready with signs, and the ever-present face masks to help curb the spread of COVID-19. By and large, the marchers want to see change following the death of Floyd and others, including another recent victim, Ahmaud Arbery. In February, Arbery, an African-American, was chased down by two white men, a father and son, and shot to death. The killing took place in February, but no arrests were made until after a video of the incident leaked to the press months later. “I’m so outraged I can’t even articulate my anger,” said Carla Giorgi or Manchester. Giorgi, a white woman raising an African American son, said she fears for her child’s life as he grows up in America, given the violence African Americans are subject to. Giorgi’s friend, Helena Laquinta, of Nashua, said white people have a responsibility to minorities to end the racial injustices that are killing them. “We built this systemic racism, so we have to be the ones who change it,” Laquinta said. India Barrows, a Manchester resident and an African American, said the country needs to stop harming minorities. The violence and discrimination minorities face from civil authorities in New Hampshire is a long-standing problem, she said. “This has been happening since I was 18,” Barrows said. James McKim, president of the Manchester chapter of the NAACP, attended the march to support the Black Lives Matter movement. “We have to talk about the scourge of racism and discrimination in this country,” McKim said. McKim said that while race relations in New Hampshire are good overall, racism is real and it does lasting harm. He’s currently dealing with officials involved in Albany where two New Hampshire State Troopers were caught on video smashing into the car of Jean Saint Preux, an African American, and pulling him out of his vehicle by his dreadlocks. McKim said he’s spoken with police and FBI agents about that case. McKim said the problem stems from people not seeing the full human dignity in other people, and then treating them as less than human. “Many people don’t see others as individuals,” McKim said. Minneapolis Police Officer Derek Chauvin was captured on video with his knee on Floyd’s neck during an arrest as Floyd can be heard begging for air. Floyd later died and it took authorities in Minneapolis days to arrest Chauvin and charge him with third-degree murder. Saturday’s march had protesters headed down Elm Street past City Hall chanting “No Justice, No Peace,” “Black Lives Matter,” and “Hands Up, Don’t Shoot,” among other refrains. The march and rally afterward were peaceful, with Manchester police providing traffic control to clear the road for marchers. Gov. Chris Sununu issued the following statement following the rally: “This morning I called the organizers ahead of the George Floyd March in Manchester to let them know the State of New Hampshire stands with them in their calls for justice,” said Gov. Chris Sununu. “This important conversation must continue and we must constructively work together as a nation to ensure there is change.” Manchester Police Chief Carl Capano is seen on the video engaging with the protesters and talking about Floyd’s death. “[What happened to George Floyd] disgusts me and every police officer standing behind me,” Capano said. “Nobody hates a bad cop more than a good cop.”",0.0

The driver of the truck, Scott Kimball, 43, and passenger, his son, Mark Kimball, 19, were arrested and charged with felony riot and felony criminal threatening, according to police. As of 5 p.m., there was still ""activity"" outside the police station, said Lt. Shawn McCabe, and the building remained closed to visitors for the ""safety of officers and employees."" Police declined to say where the two men were from. Stacy Harrison, a photographer on assignment for Manchester Ink Link, was at the scene when it unfolded. She said a small group of protesters gathered at the police station at 405 Valley St. after the Elm Street demonstration. It was an effort to initiate a dialog with law enforcement, according to organizers of the earlier march, which drew an estimated 1,000 people. The march itself was peaceful and organizers even had two people offering participants free face masks (cognizant of social distancing in the age of COVID-19) in baskets at the end of ski poles. At the police station, however, things turned ugly when a young man saw a black pickup truck with a huge Trump flag in its bed heading up Valley Street, from Elm Street, and nearing the police station. Harrison said the protester, who she described as a black man in his late teens or early 20s, started swearing. She turned to see what he was looking at and saw the truck. The driver and passenger were both white males. ""Every nasty possible thing you can think he was swearing at the truck,"" she said. Harrison said as the truck crawled by her and her 15-year-old daughter, the occupants of the truck – a driver and passenger – began hurling insults at the young man. The young man responded with his own diatribe. She thought those in the truck were going to yell whatever they were going to yell and then keep going but then the young man went toward the truck and a heated exchange took place. ""They were yelling the ""N"" word,"" she said. ""They were screaming at each other and I heard the word ""Trump"" a few times."" By then other people saw what was happening and headed toward the truck as well. ""They all sort of swarmed like a bunch of bees towards the truck,"" she said. The driver pulled the truck over into the parking lot outside Associated Concrete Coatings and the yelling continued. Someone threw something that was white – Harrison thought it might be a piece of paper, a bottle cap or a water bottle – which bounced off the driver’s window. Then she saw something black being waved around by someone in the truck and heard shouts of, ""He’s got a gun. He’s got a gun."" Officers immediately surrounded the truck. Initially, she said there were 20 to 25 officers but more streamed out of the station. She estimated there were about 60 officers in the street by the time two men were taken into custody. Melissa Bernardin, a longtime resident of Concord, was also at police headquarters when the violence erupted. She had come to Manchester Saturday morning to support the cause, and was part of the group that moved from Elm Street to police headquarters. ""By the time I arrived the situation had gone from tense to a positive dialogue with police,"" Bernardin said. At some point she said she noticed a pick-up truck drive slowly by the police station displaying a large Trump flag. Several minutes later she saw the same truck coming back from the other direction. She regarded the people in the truck as instigators. ""Some of the protesters who also saw the truck started yelling at the truck. I recall seeing a protester throw a water bottle at the truck. At that point I started running toward the truck to try and deescalate the situation because I know it wasn’t going to turn into anything good,"" Bernardin said. ""I saw the driver of the truck jump out with a gun at which point I ran away to seek shelter behind a concrete lamp post, but I heard the driver cocked and pointed the gun at the crowd. And then I heard that the passenger got out and drew his gun out of his holster but that he didn’t point it at anyone."" Although Manchester is far removed from Minneapolis, she suspects people came out in solidarity with the Black Life Matters movement here for the same reason she did. ""The issue of racism and police brutality in our country is one that touches all communities, and while there may be different levels of racism and police brutality against people of color in different communities, we all feel every human deserves to be treated with dignity,"" Bernardin says. ""We feel solidarity with individuals who are killed at the hands of police."" She says she considers herself a white ally of the Black Lives Matter movement. ""I’ve personally come to an understanding of how prevalent racism and violence against people of color is in our society through reading and learning and following the news, and the more you follow it the more heartbreaking it is,"" Bernardin said. ""I can’t see any way not to join a protest in solidarity with those being directly affected by police brutality."" She said she’s thankful the day’s events were mostly peaceful. ""I’m thankful the men who jumped out of the truck with guns didn’t kill anyone. It’s terrifying to me that a group of people who show up in public to demonstrate because they care about the intrinsic value of human life could have to face down such a terrifying threat."" In a news release, police agreed that the Black Lives Matter demonstration earlier in the day was peaceful and those in attendance were respectful of each other and police. No one was arrested. After the march, 100 people gathered outside the station when about 1:30 p.m. the confrontation occurred Police confirmed one of the truck’s occupants pulled out a gun – they did not say whether it was the passenger or driver – but both were taken into custody. They were being booked Saturday afternoon. Police said their identities will be released later. People remained outside the station after the arrests were made. Police Chief Carlo Capano and Assistant Chief Ryan Grant talked with protesters following the arrests. In one video recording, posted online by Matthew Lawrence, Capano is heard talking about what happened to George Floyd, the Minneapolis man who died after Officer Derek Chauvin held his foot on Floyd’s neck for nine minutes. Chauvin is charged with third-degree murder. ""[What happened to George Floyd] disgusts me and every police officer standing behind me,"" Capano said. ""Nobody hates a bad cop more than a good cop."" As of 2:30 p.m., some people were still outside the police station. Police said while the department is open, the building is closed ""for the safety of our officers and employees,"" according to the news release issued by Public Information Officer Heather Hamel.

Television news helicopter footage Sunday afternoon showed people running into multiple stores in northeast Philadelphia, well outside the city center, and emerging with merchandise as disorder continued for a second day elsewhere in the city. WCAU-TV showed live aerial shots for more than an hour Sunday afternoon of people running from store to store in strip malls in northeast Philadelphia’s Port Richmond section, emerging with armfuls of merchandise as police units tried to keep up.

1621433181,2020-05-31 06:01:28,Leonard Pitts: George Floyd’s death raises an old question: ‘How long?’,https://www.sunjournal.com/2020/05/31/leonard-pitts-george-floyds-death-raises-an-old-question-how-long/,en,False,,68001,sunjournal.com,http://www.sunjournal.com/#spider,"“I know you’re asking today, how long will it take?” Thus spake Martin Luther King Jr. at the end of the Selma to Montgomery voting rights march. He went on to assure his soul-weary people that the moment of their deliverance was just a little ways down the road. “However difficult the moment,” he said, “however frustrating the hour, it will not be long, because truth crushed to Earth will rise again. How long? Not long, because no lie can live forever. How long? Not long … ” And yet, 55 years later, here we are still asking the same thing. Oh Lord, how long? Because 55 years later, we are trapped in a revolving-door nightmare where every exit leads back to more of the same — Oscar, John, Amadou, Atatiana, Tamir, Sean, Freddie, Eric, Sandra, Breonna, Michael, Philando and now, George Floyd, a litany of unarmed African Americans killed by police acting under color of authority. How long can we see our sons and sisters murdered with impunity? How long can we endure with impotent fury? How long can we go on, exhausted to our bones? How long can we be backstabbed by the American dream? Minneapolis police were called on Floyd Monday for supposedly trying to pass a counterfeit bill. They said — surveillance video does not support this — he resisted arrest. In an excruciating bystander video, Officer Derek Chauvin is seen kneeling his full body weight on Floyd’s neck for many long minutes. “I can’t breathe,” moans Floyd, who is handcuffed. Still Chauvin kneels. “I’m about to die,” cries Floyd. Still Chauvin kneels. “Mama!” howls Floyd. Still Chauvin kneels. Floyd is unconscious. And yet even still, Chauvin kneels, Chauvin kneels, Chauvin kneels. Colin Kaepernick once knelt — remember that? — in protest of police brutality just like this. Many white people, including the one in the White House, lost their minds over that. Do not expect similar outrage here, much less the reckoning we really need. Yes, Chauvin and three other officers have been fired. That’s not enough. Yes, the FBI is investigating. That’s not enough. Yes, the officers could be prosecuted. Still not enough. Indeed, to individuate this to Chauvin or Minneapolis or even policing is to miss the point. It doesn’t matter whether we’re talking police brutality, health care inequality, job discrimination, cross burning or voter suppression. It doesn’t matter if the video shows a man face down on the street crying for his mother as a cop’s knee presses upon his airway or a woman in Central Park weaponizing her whiteness, shrieking to a 911 dispatcher that a black man is attacking her when all he’s done is ask her to put her dog on a leash. Does not matter. It’s all the same story expressed in different ways, contrasting iterations of a single daily aggression: the infernal and seemingly eternal inability of American people and institutions to treat African Americans as if their lives have meaning and value. We’ve been waiting for that to change much longer than 55 years. And to be honest, some of us are tired of it. Indeed, to listen to some African Americans these days — to hear their anger, their deep exhaustion, their cynicism, their emotional disinvestment in this country — is to sense America is running out of time to be what America is supposed to be. And to hear words King meant for reassurance echo as a warning. Just how long can people be expected to put up with hypocrisy and lies? How long can they quiescently endure a revolving-door nightmare? How long before something breaks? How long? Not long. Leonard Pitts Jr. is a columnist for the Miami Herald.

JENNIFER: TH Advertisement National coronavirus updates: Top health officials monitoring nationwide protests in fear of virus spread Share Shares Copy Link Copy The latest:There have been more than 1.9 million coronavirus cases in the United States, according to the Johns Hopkins University tally.The U.S. death toll has surpassed 110,000 people, according to Hopkins.The U.S. government's current supply of remdesivir, the only drug known to work against coronavirus, will run out at the end of the month.New World Health Organization guidance recommends that fabric masks — which can be homemade — be at least three layers.Health officials have raised concern about coronavirus spread as thousands of people are now braving a pandemic to participate in the national protests sparked by the death of George Floyd.The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Sunday it was closely monitoring the demonstrations taking place across the U.S. and warned such gatherings could spur coronavirus transmission. Some states are already seeing upward trends of new cases.For three months, the country passed one grim milestone after the other, hitting 100,000 coronavirus deaths in late May. Public health officials have said without the lockdowns that most states put in place, that death toll could have been significantly higher.As those lockdowns were lifted and other measures were loosened, the CDC and other top health officials urged Americans to use face coverings when they go out and always maintain a distance.But the large protests make it hard to keep the recommended social distancing guidelines and ""may put others at risk,"" CDC spokesperson Kristen Nordlund said in a statement.""It is too early to know what, if any, effect these events will have on the federal COVID-19 response. Every local situation is different. State and local officials will make decisions to protect public health and safety based on circumstances on the ground,"" she said.Earlier this month, CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield said protesters should be evaluated and tested for the virus.""I do think there is a potential, unfortunately, for this to be a seeding event,"" he said — especially in metropolitan areas where there has been significant transmission.So far, more than 1,942,000 people have been infected in the U.S., and at least 110,514 have died, according to Johns Hopkins University.Some states see rise in new casesWhile the early parts of the outbreak in the country hit dense metropolitan areas on the coast the hardest — including California and New York — the past few weeks have seen wider spread in inland states, including Arkansas, Texas and Arizona.In Harris County, Texas, health officials said they identified a nursing home with both cases of the virus and deaths.On Friday, health officials in Utah said they were ""very concerned"" about the rise in new cases over the past week.The state has recorded more than 12,000 infections, according to Johns Hopkins.""When you're away from home, please avoid close contact with others, and wear a mask when other social distancing measures aren't feasible,"" the Utah Department of Health said on Twitter. Utah State Rep. Suzanne Harrison called the spike of cases ""very concerning (and) approaching exponential.""""Today's 18.5% positive test rate is double yesterday's (9.4%),"" she tweeted over the weekend. ""Please be careful. Practice social distancing. Avoid crowds. Use masks where appropriate. Wash your hands.""Several universities have also reported new cases within their athletic programs — including Arkansas State, Auburn University and Oklahoma State University.An important drug could run out Meanwhile, as officials emphasize the U.S. is not yet out of the woods, a government official gave a stark warning. The U.S. government's current supply of remdesivir, the only drug known to work against coronavirus, will run out at the end of the month, Dr. Robert Kadlec, a U.S. Department of Health and Human Services official, told CNN.The government's last shipment of the drug will go out the week of June 29. Gilead Sciences, the company that makes the drug, is ramping up to make more, but it's unclear how much will be available this summer.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration gave emergency authorization for remdesivir last month. The drug, an intravenous antiviral medication studied to treat Ebola, is now used on hospitalized Covid patients. A study has shown it helps cut down the length of hospital stays.The government has been working to help Gilead ""with some of their supply chain challenges in terms of raw materials and being able to accelerate the process,"" Kadlec said.""Whatever the supply may be, there may not be enough for everyone who may need it,"" he said.",0.0
1621559967,2020-05-31 09:29:00,Protesters converge on White House for second straight day,http://bangordailynews.com/2020/05/31/news/nation/protesters-converge-on-white-house-for-second-straight-day/,en,False,,20320,bangordailynews.com,http://bangordailynews.com,"Alex Brandon | AP Alex Brandon | AP • May 31, 2020 9:29 am Updated: June 1, 2020 7:19 am WASHINGTON — Police fired pepper spray at demonstrators near the White House and the D.C. National Guard was called in as pockets of violence and vandalism erupted during a second straight night of protests over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis and President Donald Trump’s response to it. Hundreds of people converged on the White House and marched along the National Mall, chanting “Black Lives Matter,” “I can’t breathe” and “No justice, no peace.” Protesters threw water bottles, traffic cones, scooters, even tear gas cans at police lines. They set fire to a car and a trash bin and smashed windows, including at Bay Atlantic University. “What are you doing? That’s a school,” one man yelled. An American flag hanging at the Export-Import Bank was taken down, burned and replaced with a Black Lives Matter banner. The D.C. demonstration was one of several around the country responding to the death of Floyd, a black man who died in police custody. Trump appeared to cheer on the tougher tactics being used by law enforcement to disperse protesters Saturday night. He commended National Guard troops deployed in Minneapolis, declaring “No games!” and he also said police in New York City “must be allowed to do their job!” “Let New York’s Finest be New York’s Finest,” Trump said on Twitter after returning to the White House from Florida, where he watched the launch of a SpaceX rocket. He did not talk to reporters upon his return and it was not clear if he could hear the protest over the sound of his helicopter. But for at least part of the flight, televisions on Air Force One were turned to Fox News and its coverage of the protests. Earlier in the day, he had belittled the protesters and pledged to “stop mob violence.” “I stand before you as a friend and ally to every American seeking justice and peace, and I stand before you in firm opposition to anyone exploiting this tragedy to loot, rob, attack and menace,” the president said after watching the launch of a SpaceX rocket. “Healing, not hatred, justice, not chaos, are the missions at hand.” Police were in tactical gear. The D.C. National Guard was activated at the direction of the secretary of the Army and at the request of the Park Police to help maintain order near the White House, Commanding Gen. William J. Walker said in a post on the Guard’s Facebook page. “We’re sick of it. The cops are out of control,” protester Olga Hall said. “They’re wild. There’s just been too many dead boys,” she said. Some vocal protesters directed their comments at a black police officer. “Do you support this violence?” they asked him. “How are you going to protect your kids?” The officer got emotional to the point he had to be relieved. An activist wearing a Black Lives Matter T-shirt put himself between police and the protesters and yelled, “Stop. This is what they want.” Speaking over a megaphone earlier in the evening, Cameron McCall said, “We don’t need violence. All we need are our voices.” While some protesters stayed near the White House, others marched through the streets chanting, “No justice and no peace.” and “Say his name: George Floyd.” The mood was angry and several speakers implored marchers to remain peaceful. The march paused between the Washington Monument and the National Museum of African American History and Culture. Demonstrators sat down in the street for a moment of silence lasting for the eight minutes or more that the Minneapolis police officer reportedly knelt on Floyd’s neck. At the Lincoln Memorial, one organizer spoke over a megaphone. “Look to the left and to the right and thank that person. We can’t hug anybody because of COVID, but I love you anyway.” Many of the protesters wore masks, but did not socially distance themselves. Another group circled through the Capitol Hill neighborhood for at least an hour in cars, honking. A helicopter hovered overhead. In a series of tweets earlier Saturday, Trump doubted protesters’ allegiance to Floyd’s memory, saying they were “professionally managed.” He offered no evidence to back his assertion, and the president even seemed to invite supporters to make their presence felt: “Tonight, I understand, is MAGA NIGHT AT THE WHITE HOUSE???” Trump later rejected the suggestion that he was stoking a potential conflict between protesters and his supporters. “I was just asking. But I have no idea if they are going to be here,” he said. “MAGA is Make America Great Again. By the way, they love African American people. They love black people.” At Saturday’s demonstration, there was no evidence of a counter-move by Trump supporters. Trump said he had “watched every move” from inside the executive mansion during Friday’s protest and “couldn’t have felt more safe” as the Secret Service let the protesters carry on, “but whenever someone … got too frisky or out of line, they would quickly come down on then, hard — didn’t know what hit them.” The president also criticized the mayors of Washington and Minneapolis. Trump said Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey “is probably a very good person, but he’s a radical, left mayor.” He then described how he watched as a police station in the city was overrun. “For that police station to be abandoned and taken over, I’ve never seen anything so horrible and stupid in my life,” Trump said when speaking briefly to reporters at the White House. He said Minnesota officials have to get tougher with rioters, and that by doing so they would be honoring the memory of Floyd. The Secret Service said in a statement Saturday that six protesters were arrested in Washington and “multiple” officers were injured. There were no details on the charges or nature of the injuries. A spokesman for U.S. Park Police said their officers made no arrests, but several suffered minor injuries and one was taken to a hospital after being struck in the helmet by a projectile. Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf on Saturday called the protesters “criminals” who committed “acts of violence while hiding behind their First Amendment right of lawful protest.” Late Saturday and early Sunday, protesters vented their rage by breaking into tiny shops of Georgetown, on the western edge of the District, and in downtown Washington, breaking windows and glass doors of many stores and looting some of them. In his tweeting, Trump claimed that many Secret Service agents were “just waiting for action” and ready to unleash “the most vicious dogs, and the most ominous weapons, I have ever seen.” His reference to “vicious dogs” potentially being sicced on protesters revisits images from the civil rights movement when marchers faced snarling police dogs and high-pressure fire hoses. In a news conference Saturday afternoon, Muriel Bowser, mayor of the nation’s capital, called Trump’s remarks “gross” and said the reference to attack dogs conjures up with the worst memories of the nation’s fight against segregation. “I call upon our city and our nation to exercise restraint, great restraint, even as the president tries to divide us,” she said. “I feel like these comments are an attack on humanity, an attack on black America, and they make my city less safe.” In contrast with the president’s tweets, the Secret Service said it “respects the right to assemble and we ask that individuals do so peacefully for the safety of all.” AP video journalist Nathan Ellgren contributed to this report.",0.0
1621559965,2020-05-31 09:42:10,Protests over police killings rage in dozens of US cities,http://bangordailynews.com/2020/05/31/news/nation/protests-over-police-killings-rage-in-dozens-of-us-cities/,en,False,,20320,bangordailynews.com,http://bangordailynews.com,"Travis Long | The News & Observer via AP Travis Long | The News & Observer via AP • May 31, 2020 9:42 am Updated: June 1, 2020 7:19 am MINNEAPOLIS — Tense protests over the death of George Floyd and other police killings of black people grew Saturday from New York to Tulsa to Los Angeles, with police cars set ablaze and reports of injuries mounting on all sides as the country convulsed through another night of unrest after months of coronavirus lockdowns. The protests, which began in Minneapolis following Floyd’s death Monday after a police officer pressed a knee on his neck until he stopped breathing, have left parts of the city a grid of broken windows, burned-out buildings and ransacked stores. The unrest has since become a national phenomenon as protesters decry years of deaths at police hands. Tens of thousands of people were in the streets across the country, many of them not wearing masks or observing social distancing, raising concerns among health experts about the potential for spreading the coronavirus pandemic at a time when much of the country is in the process of reopening society and the economy. After a tumultuous Friday, racially diverse crowds held mostly peaceful demonstrations in dozens of cities, though many later descended into violence as had happened the previous night. Few corners of America were untouched, from protesters setting fires inside Reno’s city hall, to police launching tear gas at rock-throwing demonstrators in Fargo, North Dakota, to shattered windows at police headquarters in Richmond, Virginia. — In Indianapolis, police were investigating “multiple shootings” downtown, including one that left a person dead, amid the protests. Police gave few details but said no officers were involved. — In Washington, the National Guard was deployed outside the White House, where chanting crowds taunted law enforcement officers. Dressed in camouflage and holding shields, the troops stood in a tight line a few yards from the crowd, preventing them from pushing forward. President Donald Trump, who spent much of Saturday in Florida for the SpaceX rocket launch, landed on the lawn in the presidential helicopter at dusk and went inside without speaking to journalists. — In Philadelphia, at least 13 officers were injured when peaceful protests turned violent and at least four police vehicles were set on fire. Other fires were set throughout downtown. — In Salt Lake City, protesters defied a curfew and National Guard troops were deployed by Utah’s governor. Demonstrators flipped a police car and lit it on fire, and another vehicle was later set ablaze. Police said six people were arrested and a police officer was injured after being struck in the head with a baseball bat. — In Los Angeles, protesters chanted “Black Lives Matter,” some within inches of the face shields of officers. Police used batons to move the crowd back and fired rubber bullets. A graffiti-covered police car burned in the street. — And in New York City, dangerous confrontations flared repeatedly as officers made arrests and cleared streets. A video showed two NYPD cruisers lurching into a crowd of demonstrators who were pushing a barricade against one of them and pelting it with objects. Several people were knocked to the ground, and it was unclear if anyone was hurt. “The mistakes that are happening are not mistakes. They’re repeated violent terrorist offenses and people need to stop killing black people,” Brooklyn protester Meryl Makielski said. Not all protests devolved into violence. In Juneau, Alaska, law enforcement officers joined elected officials and residents at a peaceful protest in front of a giant whale sculpture on the city’s waterfront. “We don’t tolerate excessive use of force,” Juneau Police Chief Ed Mercer told the gathering. Back in Minneapolis, the city where the protests began, police, state troopers and National Guard members moved in soon after an 8 p.m. curfew took effect to break up protests, firing tear gas and rubber bullets to clear streets outside a police precinct and elsewhere. The show of force came after three days when police largely avoided engaging protesters, and after the state poured in more than 4,000 National Guard troops to Minneapolis and said the number would soon rise to nearly 11,000. “The situation in Minneapolis is no longer in any way about the murder of George Floyd,” said Gov. Tim Walz, who also said local forces had been overmatched the previous day. “It is about attacking civil society, instilling fear and disrupting our great cities.” Minneapolis’ streets steadily grew calmer as the night went on, and Corrections Commissioner Paul Schnell said the tough response would remain as long as it takes to “quell this situation.” Some residents were glad to see the upheaval dissipating. “l live here. I haven’t been able to sleep,” said Iman Muhammad, whose neighborhood saw multiple fires set Friday night. Muhammad said she sympathized with peaceful protests over Floyd’s death but disagreed with the violence: “Wrong doesn’t answer wrong.” Trump appeared to cheer on the tougher tactics Saturday night, commending the Guard deployment in Minneapolis, declaring “No games!” and saying police in New York City “must be allowed to do their job!” Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden condemned the violence as he continued to express common cause with those demonstrating after Floyd’s death. “The act of protesting should never be allowed to overshadow the reason we protest,” Biden said in a statement Saturday night. Overnight curfews were imposed in more than a dozen major cities nationwide, including Atlanta, Denver, Los Angeles, Minneapolis and Seattle. More than 1,300 people have been arrested in 16 cities since Thursday, including over 500 Friday in Los Angeles. The unrest comes at a time when most Americans have spent months inside over concerns surrounding the coronavirus, which the president has called an “invisible enemy.” The events of the last 72 hours, seen live on national television, have shown the opposite: a sudden pivot to crowds, screaming protesters and burning buildings, and a stark contrast to the empty streets of recent months. “Quite frankly I’m ready to just lock people up,” Atlanta Police Chief Erika Shields said at a news conference. Demonstrations there turned violent Friday, and police were arresting protesters Saturday on blocked-off downtown streets. “Yes, you caught us off balance once. It’s not going to happen twice.” This week’s unrest recalled the riots in Los Angeles nearly 30 years ago after the acquittal of the white police officers who beat Rodney King, a black motorist who had led them on a high-speed chase. The protests of Floyd’s killing have gripped many more cities, but the losses in Minneapolis have yet to approach the staggering totals Los Angeles saw during five days of rioting in 1992, when more than 60 people died, 2,000-plus were injured and thousands arrested, with property damage topping $1 billion. Many protesters spoke of frustration that Floyd’s death was one more in a litany. It came in the wake of the killing in Georgia of Ahmaud Arbery, a black man who was shot dead after being pursued by two white men while running in their neighborhood, and in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic that has thrown millions out of work, killed more than 100,000 people in the U.S. and disproportionately affected black people. The officer who held his knee to Floyd’s neck as he begged for air was arrested Friday and charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. But many protesters are demanding the arrests of the three other officers involved. Trump stoked the anger on Twitter, saying that if protesters had breached the White House fence, they would “have been greeted with the most vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons, I have ever seen.” Leaders in many affected cities have voiced outrage over Floyd’s killing and expressed sympathy for protesters’ concerns. But as the unrest intensified, they spoke of a desperate need to protect their cities and said they would call in reinforcements, despite concerns that could lead to more heavy-handed tactics. Governors in Georgia, Kentucky, Ohio and Texas also activated the National Guard after protests there turned violent. Police in St. Louis were investigating the death of a protester who climbed between two trailers of a Fed Ex truck and was killed when it drove away. And a person was killed in the area of protests in downtown Detroit just before midnight after someone fired shots into an SUV, officers said. Police had initially said someone fired into the crowd from an SUV.",0.0

Terrill | AP Mark J. Terrill | AP • May 31, 2020 10:20 am Updated: June 1, 2020 7:19 am MINNEAPOLIS — Another night of unrest in every corner of the country left charred and shattered landscapes in dozens of American cities Sunday as years of festering frustrations over the mistreatment of African Americans at the hands of police boiled over in expressions of rage met with tear gas and rubber bullets. Cars and businesses were torched, the words “I can’t breathe” were spray-painted all over buildings, a fire in a trash bin burned near the gates of the White House, and tens of thousands marched peacefully through city streets to protest the death of George Floyd, a black man who died Monday after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee on his neck until he stopped breathing. His death is one of a litany of racial tragedies that have thrown the country into chaos amid the coronavirus pandemic that has left millions out of work and killed more than 100,000 people in the U.S., including disproportionate numbers of black people. “We’re sick of it. The cops are out of control,” protester Olga Hall said in Washington D.C. “They’re wild. There’s just been too many dead boys.” People set fire to police cars, threw bottles at police officers and busted windows of storefronts, carrying away TVs and other items even as some protesters urged them to stop. In Indianapolis, police were investigating multiple shootings, including one that left a person dead amid the protests — adding to deaths in Detroit and Minneapolis in recent days. In Minneapolis, the city where the protests began, police, state troopers and National Guard members moved in soon after an 8 p.m. curfew took effect to break up protests, firing tear gas and rubber bullets to clear streets outside a police precinct and elsewhere. At least 13 police officers were injured in Philadelphia when peaceful protests turned violent and at least four police vehicles were set on fire. In New York City, dangerous confrontations flared repeatedly as officers made arrests and cleared streets. A video showed two NYPD cruisers lurching into a crowd of demonstrators who were pushing a barricade against one of them and pelting it with objects. Several people were knocked to the ground, and it was unclear if anyone was hurt. “The mistakes that are happening are not mistakes. They’re repeated violent terrorist offenses and people need to stop killing black people,” Brooklyn protester Meryl Makielski said. Few corners of America were untouched, from protesters setting fires inside Reno’s city hall, to police launching tear gas at rock-throwing demonstrators in Fargo, North Dakota. In Salt Lake City, demonstrators flipped a police car and lit it on fire. Police said six people were arrested and a police officer was injured after being struck in the head with a baseball bat. In Ferguson, Missouri, where Michael Brown Jr. was shot and killed by a white police officer in 2014, sparking a wave of protests throughout the country, mostly peaceful protests turned late Saturday and six officers hit with rocks and fireworks were injured. Police have arrested at least 1,669 people in 22 cities since Thursday, according to a tally by The Associated Press. Nearly a third of those arrests came in Los Angeles, where the governor declared a state of emergency and ordered the National Guard to back up the city’s 10,000 police officers as dozens of fires burned across the city. The damage in U.S. cities came as many Americans plan to return to in-person church services on Sunday for the first time in several weeks since the pandemic forced a ban on large gatherings. Pastors in pulpits across the country will likely be urging peace amid the rubble of riots. Trump appeared to cheer on the tougher tactics Saturday night, commending the National Guard deployment in Minneapolis, declaring “No games!” and saying police in New York City “must be allowed to do their job!” Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden condemned the violence as he continued to express common cause with those demonstrating after Floyd’s death. “The act of protesting should never be allowed to overshadow the reason we protest,” Biden said in a statement Saturday night. Overnight curfews were imposed in more than a dozen major cities nationwide, including Atlanta, Denver, Los Angeles, Minneapolis, San Francisco and Seattle. This week’s unrest recalled the riots in Los Angeles nearly 30 years ago after the acquittal of the white police officers who beat Rodney King, a black motorist who had led them on a high-speed chase. The protests of Floyd’s killing have gripped many more cities, but the losses in Minneapolis have yet to approach the staggering totals Los Angeles saw during five days of rioting in 1992, when more than 60 people died, 2,000-plus were injured and thousands arrested, with property damage topping $1 billion. But not all protests were marred by violence. In Juneau, Alaska, local police joined protesters at a rally in front of a giant whale sculpture on the city’s waterfront. “We don’t tolerate excessive use of force,” Juneau Police Chief Ed Mercer told a gathering where most people wore masks and some sang Alaska Native songs. The show of force in Minneapolis came after three days when police largely avoided engaging protesters, and after the state poured in more than 4,000 National Guard troops to Minneapolis and said the number would soon rise to nearly 11,000. “The situation in Minneapolis is no longer in any way about the murder of George Floyd,” said Gov. Tim Walz, who also said local forces had been overmatched the previous day. “It is about attacking civil society, instilling fear and disrupting our great cities.” Some residents were glad to see the upheaval dissipating. “l live here. I haven’t been able to sleep,” said Iman Muhammad, whose neighborhood saw multiple fires set Friday night. Muhammad said she sympathized with peaceful protests over Floyd’s death but disagreed with the violence: “Wrong doesn’t answer wrong.” Numerous AP journalists contributed from across the US",0.0

Huh | AP Nam Y. Huh | AP • May 31, 2020 11:56 am Updated: June 1, 2020 7:21 am NEW YORK — NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell says “there remains an urgent need for action” following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis and the protests around the country that have followed. From New York to Los Angeles and several cities in between, thousands protested Floyd’s death and repeated police killings of black men. Floyd was a handcuffed black man who died Monday after a Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes even after he stopped moving and pleading for air. Officer Derek Chauvin, 44, was charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Floyd’s death and the ensuing protests have prompted many sports figures — including athletes, coaches and league officials — to speak out in recent days. “As current events dramatically underscore, there remains much more to do as a country and as a league,” Goodell said in his statement Saturday. “These tragedies inform the NFL’s commitment and our ongoing efforts. There remains an urgent need for action. We recognize the power of our platform in communities and as part of the fabric of American society. “We embrace that responsibility and are committed to continuing the important work to address these systemic issues together with our players, clubs and partners.” Goodell added that the protesters reactions “reflect the pain, anger and frustration that so many of us feel.” He also sent condolences to Floyd’s family — as well as those of Breonna Taylor in Louisville, and Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia. Taylor, a 26-year-old EMT, was shot eight times by narcotics detectives who knocked down her front door on March 13. Arbery, who was the cousin of Detroit Lions safety Tracy Walker, was a 25-year-old black man who was shot dead after being pursued by two white men while running in their neighborhood. NFL Players Association executive director DeMaurice Smith sent a letter to all of the league’s players Saturday, addressing the events around the country. “The country is hurting, there is uncertainty and there is danger,” Smith wrote. “It is also clear that the pain, while shared by so many, has a history of being (borne) more by some than others. It is as wrong to be willfully ignorant to this pain as it is to use this pain as cover for inflicting pain on others.” NFLPA president JC Tretter of the Cleveland Browns also wrote a statement on Twitter, saying he felt “a range of emotions” this week. “Racism is something that we all must take responsibility to end,” Tretter wrote. “As human beings, we need to identify and challenge prejudice, rather than deny it. Silence in the face of injustice only works to protect and perpetuate that injustice.” Coach Dwane Casey of the NBA’s Detroit Pistons also released a statement. “Fifty-four years ago, I was an 8-year-old boy living in rural Kentucky when the schools were desegregated,” Casey said. “I walked into a white school where I was not wanted nor welcomed. At that time, there were no cell phones to record my treatment, no cable news stations with 24/7 coverage, no social media to record the reality of the situation or offer support nor condemnation. But I can remember exactly how I felt as an 8-year-old child. I felt helpless. I felt as if I was neither seen, nor heard, nor understood. As I have watched the events unfold in the days following the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis, a city where I coached and once called home, I see how many people continue to feel those same feelings — helpless, frustrated, invisible, angry. I understand the outrage because it seems the list continues to grow: Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, George Floyd. The injustices continue to mount and nothing seems to be changing. “Fifty-four years later, my son is now 8 years old and I look at the world he is growing up in and wonder, how much has really changed? How often is he judged on sight? Is he growing up in a world where he is seen, and heard, and understood? Does he feel helpless? Will he be treated like George Floyd or Ahmaud Abrey? What have we really done in the last 54 years to make his 8-year-old world better than mine was? We all have to be and do better.” In Germany, U.S. national soccer player Weston McKennie played for Schalke on Saturday wearing an armband referencing Floyd’s death. The midfielder had the handwritten message “Justice for George” on white tape around his left arm. “To be able to use my platform to bring attention to a problem that has been going on to long feels good!!!” McKennie wrote on Twitter alongside pictures of himself wearing the armband. “We have to stand up for what we believe in and I believe that it is time that we are heard!” McKennie’s Schalke team lost 1-0 to Werder Bremen.",0.0

The protests, which began in Minneapolis following Floyd's death Monday after a police officer pressed a knee on his neck for more than eight minutes, have left parts of the city a grid of broken windows, burned-out buildings and ransacked stores. The unrest has since become a national phenomenon as protesters decry years of deaths at police hands. The large crowds involved, with many people not wearing masks or social distancing, raised concerns among health experts about the potential for helping spread the coronavirus pandemic at a time when overall deaths are on the decline nationwide and much of the country is in the process of reopening society and the economy. After a tumultuous Friday night, racially diverse crowds took to the streets again for mostly peaceful demonstrations in dozens of cities from coast to coast. The previous day’s protests also started calmly, but many descended into violence later in the day.

National Guard was called in as hundreds converged on the mall and pockets of violence erupted during a second straight night of protests. Outside the White House, crowds chanted, taunted Secret Service agents and at times pushed against security barriers, and police used pepper spray. President Donald Trump, who spent much of Saturday in Florida for the SpaceX rocket launch, landed on the lawn in the presidential helicopter at dusk and went inside without speaking to journalists.

AP — In Philadelphia, at least 13 officers were injured when peaceful protests turned violent and at least four police vehicles were set on fire. Other fires were set throughout downtown. — In the Greenwood District of Tulsa, Oklahoma, the site of a 1921 massacre of black people that left as many as 300 dead and the city’s thriving black district in ruins, protesters blocked intersections and chanted the name of Terence Crutcher, a black man killed by a police officer in 2016. — In Seattle, police fired tear gas and stun grenades to try to disperse black-clad crowds that smashed downtown shopfronts, stole merchandise and tossed mannequins onto the street. — In Los Angeles, protesters chanted “Black Lives Matter,” some within inches of the face shields of officers. Police used batons to move the crowd back and fired rubber bullets. One man used a skateboard to try to break a police SUV's windshield. A spray-painted police car burned in the street.

We have to be out here,” said Brianna Petrisko, among those at lower Manhattan’s Foley Square, where most were wearing masks amid the coronavirus pandemic. “This is the only way we’re going to be heard.” Back in Minneapolis, the city where the protests began, 29-year-old Sam Allkija said the damage seen in recent days reflects longstanding frustration and rage in the black community. “I don’t condone them,” he said. “But you have to look deeper into why these riots are happening.” Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, who said local forces had been overmatched Friday, fully mobilized the state’s National Guard and promised a massive show of force. The Guard announced Saturday it had more than 4,000 members responding to Minneapolis and would quickly have nearly 11,000. RELATED: National Guard activated, curfew implemented in response to Louisville protests RELATED: 'Stay Home' the message from leaders on continued community unrest “The situation in Minneapolis is no longer in any way about the murder of George Floyd,” Walz said. “It is about attacking civil society, instilling fear and disrupting our great cities.” Soon after the city's 8 p.m. curfew went into force, lines of police cars and officers in riot gear moved in to confront protesters, firing tear gas to push away throngs of people milling around the city’s 5th police precinct station. The tougher tactics came after city and state leaders were criticized for not forcefully enough confronting days of violent and damaging protests that included protesters burning down a police station shortly after officers abandoned it. Trump appeared to cheer on the tougher tactics being used by law enforcement Saturday night. He commended the Guard deployment in Minneapolis, declaring “No games!” and also said police in New York City “must be allowed to do their job!” Overnight curfews were imposed in more than a dozen major cities nationwide, ranging from 6 p.m. in parts of South Carolina to 10 p.m. around Ohio. People were also told to be off the streets of Atlanta, Denver, Los Angeles, Seattle and Minneapolis — where thousands had ignored the same order Friday night. More than 1,300 people have been arrested in 16 cities since Thursday, with more than 500 of those happening in Los Angeles on Friday. The unrest comes at a time when most Americans have spent months inside over concerns surrounding the coronavirus, which the president has called an “invisible enemy.” The events of the last 72 hours, seen live on national television, have shown the opposite: a sudden pivot to crowds, screaming protesters and burning buildings, a stark contrast to the empty streets of recent months. “Quite frankly I’m ready to just lock people up,"" Atlanta Police Chief Erika Shields said at a news conference. Demonstrations there turned violent Friday, and police were arresting protesters Saturday on blocked-off downtown streets. “Yes, you caught us off balance once. It’s not going to happen twice.” This week's unrest recalled the riots in Los Angeles nearly 30 years ago after the acquittal of the white police officers who beat Rodney King, a black motorist who had led them on a high-speed chase. The protests of Floyd's killing have gripped many more cities, but the losses in Minneapolis have yet to approach the staggering totals Los Angeles saw during five days of rioting in 1992, when more than 60 people died, 2,000-plus were injured and thousands arrested, with property damage topping $1 billion. Many protesters spoke of frustration that Floyd’s death was one more in a litany. It came in the wake of the killing in Georgia of Ahmaud Arbery, a black man who was shot dead after being pursued by two white men while running in their neighborhood, and in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic that has thrown millions out of work, killed more than 100,000 people in the U.S. and disproportionately affected black people. The officer who held his knee to Floyd’s neck as he begged for air was arrested Friday and charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. But many protesters are demanding the arrests of the three other officers involved. Leaders in many affected cities have voiced outrage over Floyd's killing and expressed sympathy for protesters' concerns. But as the unrest intensified, they spoke of a desperate need to protect their cities and said they would call in reinforcements, despite concerns that could lead to more heavy-handed tactics. Minnesota has steadily increased to 1,700 the number of National Guardsmen it says it needs to contain the unrest, and the governor is considering a potential offer of military police put on alert by the Pentagon. Governors in Georgia, Kentucky, Ohio and Texas also activated the National Guard after protests there turned violent overnight, while nighttime curfews were put in place in Portland, Oregon, Cincinnati and elsewhere. Police in St. Louis were investigating the death of a protester who climbed between two trailers of a Fed Ex truck and was killed when it drove away. And a person was killed in the area of protests in downtown Detroit just before midnight after someone fired shots into an SUV, officers said. Police had initially said someone fired into the crowd from an SUV.",0.0

1621685703,2020-05-31 14:11:51,Floyd’s death opens old wounds for NBA veteran Sefolosha,https://www.pressherald.com/2020/05/31/floyds-death-opens-old-wounds-for-nba-veteran-sefolosha/,en,True,,366984,pressherald.com,http://pressherald.com/,"Thabo Sefolosha knows what it’s like to be a black man, on the ground, being beaten by police officers. Such was the scenario when George Floyd died in Minneapolis last week. And five years ago, Sefolosha found himself in a similarly frightening place. “I was just horrified by what I saw,” Sefolosha said. “That could have been me.” Time has not healed all wounds for Sefolosha, the NBA veteran who said he was attacked by a group of New York Police Department officers in April 2015 while they were arresting him outside a nightclub in the city’s Chelsea neighborhood. The leg that was broken in the fracas is fine now. The emotional pain roared back last week when he saw video of Floyd, a handcuffed black man who pleaded for air in the final moments of his life as a white police officer – subsequently charged with murder – pressed a knee on his neck. Sefolosha has seen the video. He hasn’t watched much news since. His experience with police in New York has left him with a deep distrust of law enforcement, the pangs of angst flooding back even when he walks into NBA arenas and sees uniformed officers. And the latest example of police brutality left him even more upset. “People talk about a few rotten apples,” Sefolosha said in an interview with The Associated Press. “But you know, in my experience and from what we’re seeing, I think it’s deeper than that as a culture that’s deeply rooted in it, to be honest. That’s just my honest opinion. I think it’s really … part of a culture where it’s deeper than just a few bad apples.” The four officers who were involved in the incident where Floyd died were fired; the one who knelt on Floyd’s neck, Derek Chauvin, has been charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Massive protests have broken out in several cities in recent days, the country torn again over a black man dying at the hands of police. Sefolosha — a black man of Swiss descent who plays for the Houston Rockets — considered but decided against joining protests in Atlanta, where he is waiting for the resumption of the NBA season that was shut down in March because of the coronavirus pandemic. “I’m mad, for sure,” Sefolosha said. “That’s for sure. I mean, it’s 2020. Nobody should have to go through this in this time, especially after black people have given up so much for America. Black people have given up so much and done so much for this country. It’s hurtful to see it this way.” Sefolosha’s perspective changed forever on April 8, 2015. Chris Copeland, an NBA player at the time, was among three people stabbed outside the club where Sefolosha was that night; police arrived and ordered everyone to leave the area. Sefolosha says he complied but began getting harassed by officers anyway. Before long, he was on the ground. Sefolosha’s leg was broken and some ligaments were torn in the fracas, and he was arrested on several charges that a jury needed about 45 minutes to determine were unfounded. He wound up suing for $50 million, alleging his civil rights were violated, settled for $4 million and gave much of that money to a public defenders’ organization working in marginalized communities. “It changed me a lot, toward the way I see law enforcement in this country,” Sefolosha said. “And also toward the way I see the whole justice system. I went to court and I had to do all of this to prove my innocence. It really got me deep into the system and I’m really skeptical of the whole system.” NBA players have used their platforms often in recent years to protest racial inequality. Sterling Brown of the Milwaukee Bucks filed a federal civil rights lawsuit after police used a stun gun on him and arrested him over a parking incident in 2018. On Saturday, Malcolm Brogdon of the Indiana Pacers and Jaylen Brown of the Boston Celtics were among those taking part in Atlanta protests. “You see what happened in Minnesota where three human beings with a badge are watching another human being killing somebody,” said Sefolosha, who has played in the NBA since 2006 and intends to return to Switzerland when he retires. “And instead of saying, ‘OK, this is my duty as a human being,’ the duty was more toward not interfering with the other officer and saying, ‘We are clan, we stick together no matter what.’ It should be the other way around.” The NBA is closing in on finalizing a plan to resume the season in July at the Disney complex near Orlando, Florida. Sefolosha and the Rockets figure to be contenders for a championship when play resumes. For obvious reasons, Sefolosha’s mind isn’t there yet. “I’ll be happy to be with my teammates and reunited with basketball in general,” Sefolosha said. “But you know, we’re human beings, and the fight has been going on for too long and the same protests have been going on for too long. I think it’s definitely time for change and that should be a priority for all of us.” Send questions/comments to the editors. « Previous Next »",0.0

The announcement on Saturday from the nation's eighth-largest retailer came after Target stores in multiple cities became scenes of violence and unrest. Among the stores where aisles were ransacked was a Target in Minneapolis near the city's 3rd police precinct, where the four officers who were fired after Floyd's death worked. The 3rd Precinct police station was damaged by a fire last week. ""We are heartbroken by the death of George Floyd and the pain it is causing communities across the country,"" the Minneapolis-based company said in a statement. ""At this time, we have made the decision to close a number of our stores."" A Target spokesperson said that the company is evaluating closures and limiting hours on a store-by-store basis. The majority of stores being closed are located in Minnesota and California, where protests in Los Angeles led the National Guard to be deployed. Stores will also close in Colorado, Illinois, Oregon and Pennsylvania. Despite the violence that has hit its stores, the company has voiced support for demonstrators. ""The murder of George Floyd has unleashed the pent-up pain of years, as have the killings of Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor,"" Target CEO Brian Cornell wrote in a public letter on Friday. ""We say their names and hold a too-long list of others in our hearts."" It remains unclear whether the looting at Target stores was committed by demonstrators or whether they were the actions of unaffiliated bad actors. But the ongoing demonstrations have focused scrutiny on Target's past work with law enforcement — including partnerships with agencies in at least 2o cities. In Minneapolis, the company partnered with police on a program that helped install closed-circuit television cameras in the downtown area. A 2010 report released with support from the company said the ""genesis of the program was a widespread feeling some years ago in the city of Minneapolis that the downtown business district was not a pleasant place to work or visit.""

LOS ANGELES — The mayor of Atlanta, one of dozens of U.S. cities hit by massive protests, has a message for demonstrators: “If you were out protesting last night, you probably need to go get a COVID test this week.” As more beaches, churches, mosques, schools and businesses reopened worldwide, civil unrest in the United States over repeated racial injustice is raising fears of new coronavirus outbreaks in a country that has more infections and deaths than anywhere else in the world. And it’s not just in the U.S. — London hosted a large anti-racism protest Sunday that certainly violated government social distancing rules. [Our COVID-19 tracker contains the most recent information on Maine cases by county] Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms warned that “there is still a pandemic in America that’s killing black and brown people at higher numbers.” “We have two crises that are sandwiched on top of one other,” Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said. Violent protests over the death of George Floyd by police have shaken the country from Minneapolis to New York, from Atlanta to Los Angeles. Some protests have turned into riots and clashes with police, leaving stores in flames and torched cars in the streets. City officials ordered overnight curfews to quell the violence. Floyd, a black man, died May 25 in Minneapolis saying “I can’t breathe” after a white police officer pressed a knee into his neck. It was the latest in a series of deaths of black men and women at the hands of police in America. Health experts fear that silent carriers of the virus could unwittingly infect others at protests where people are packed cheek to jowl, many without masks, many chanting, singing or shouting. The virus is dispersed by microscopic droplets in the air when people cough, sneeze, sing or talk. “Whether they’re fired up or not, that doesn’t prevent them from getting the virus,” said Bradley Pollock, chairman of the Department of Public Health Sciences at the University of California, Davis. The U.S. has seen over 1.7 million infections and nearly 104,000 deaths in the pandemic, which has disproportionately affected racial minorities in a nation that does not have universal health care. Even the many protesters wearing masks are not guaranteed protection. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said cloth masks keep infected people from spreading the virus but are not designed to protect wearers from getting it. Mass protests in connection with Floyd’s death were also being held in Europe. In London, thousands of people marched Sunday chanting “No justice! No peace!” while carrying signs reading “Justice for George Floyd” and “Racism is a global issue.” Many demonstrators were not wearing masks and most in the crowd at Trafalgar Square were packed closely together. In Berlin, hundreds of protesters picketed outside the U.S. Embassy on Saturday night under the motto: “Justice for George Floyd.” Others marched near the U.S. embassy in Copenhagen, Denmark. Many Americans returned Sunday to in-person church services for the first time in weeks and tens of thousands of mosques reopened across the Middle East, but countries from India to Colombia still saw rising numbers of new infections. Nearly 6.1 million infections have been reported worldwide, with nearly 370,000 people dying, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. The true death toll is believed to be significantly higher, since many victims died of the virus without ever being tested. The situation worsened Sunday in India, where new daily cases topped 8,000 for the first time and 193 more deaths were reported. Despite that, India still is easing restrictions on shops and public transport in more states beginning Monday, although subways and schools will remain closed. In Saudi Arabia, mosques reopened Sunday for the first time in more than two months, but Islam’s holiest site in Mecca remained closed. In Jerusalem, throngs of worshippers waited outside the Al-Aqsa Mosque before it reopened. Many wore surgical masks and waited for temperature checks as they entered. In Bogota, the capital of Colombia, authorities were locking down an area of nearly 1.5 million people as cases continued to rise. Mayor Claudia Lopez said no one in the working-class Kennedy area — inaugurated by the late U.S. President John F. Kennedy in 1961 — will be allowed out, except to seek food or medical care or in case of an emergency. Factories must also close. The area has reported more nearly 2,500 infections and hospitals are reaching their limits. In Spain, Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez said Sunday that he would ask Parliament for a final two-week extension of the nation’s state of emergency that is set to expire on June 7. That allows the government to keep ordering lockdown measures to control its coronavirus outbreak, which has claimed at least 27,000 lives, many of them in overwhelmed nursing homes. “We have almost reached safe harbor,” Sánchez said. Elite sporting events will be allowed to resume in England starting Monday without spectators, paving the way for the planned June 17 return of the Premier League, the world’s richest soccer competition. But England’s deputy chief medical officer Jonathan Van-Tam warned that the situation remained precarious even before Sunday’s protest in London. Britain has seen nearly 38,500 virus deaths, the second-highest in the world after the United States, and the Conservative government has been criticized for being too slow to react to the crisis. “I believe this is also a very dangerous moment,” he said. “We have to get this right.” At the Vatican, Pope Francis cautioned people against being pessimistic as they emerge from coronavirus lockdowns. During Mass in St. Peter’s Basilica to mark Pentecost Sunday, Francis noted a tendency to say that “nothing will return as before.” That kind of thinking, Francis said, guarantees that “the one thing that certainly does not return is hope.” AP reporters from around the world contributed to this report.

PRESQUE ISLE, Maine — This year was an understated Memorial Day for the Presque Isle area. Nonetheless, several local musicians found a way to celebrate the holiday in conjunction with the rest of the nation. On Monday, May 25, at 3 p.m. musicians in Presque Isle, Caribou and Mapleton played taps — a bugle call played at flag ceremonies and funerals by the U.S. military — in near-unison. They were one group of several taking part in a nationwide effort spearheaded by CBS News correspondent Steve Hartman, who had teamed up with former Air Force bugler Jari Villanueva to remind the country of the day’s message in the wake of COVID-19 event cancellations. On Presque Isle’s Main Street, Helena and Kenneth Garrett performed a solemn rendition in front of their Maine Hope Center thrift store, playing on violin and mandolin, respectively. The Caribou-based married couple was motivated to play by their reverence for those who fought as well as their own previous military service — Kenneth was in the Army and Helena the Air Force. The couple met at the Defense Language Institute — a Department of Defense research facility — where they both studied Mandarin Chinese. Helena Garrett — who had decorated the storefront with a mannequin wearing nurse garb in honor of essential workers — said their demonstration was also about supporting essential workers as they risk their lives to contain a virus that has killed more than 100,000 people in the United States. “We want to honor health care workers. Those are kind of trenches too,” Helena Garrett said. “Even janitors that are cleaning hospitals.” Several band performers in the SAD 1 system also took part in the nationwide demonstration.

A truck driver drove into demonstrators in Minneapolis nearly a week after George Floyd died there after pleading for air as an officer pressed a knee into his neck. Protests sprang up from Boston to San Francisco, with people stealing from stores in broad daylight in Philadelphia, cities across California and elsewhere. In Minneapolis, the tanker truck sped into a peaceful crowd of thousands on a closed highway, but no one appeared to have been hit, authorities said. The Minnesota State Patrol said on Twitter that the driver’s actions were “very disturbing” and he was arrested. Protesters swarmed the truck and jumped on the hood, even as it kept moving. Police then came in force to clear the highway in the city where violence erupted after the death last week of Floyd, who was black. The protests quickly spread to dozens of cities large and small, and have lasted for days. The officer who pressed his knee onto Floyd’s neck for several minutes has been charged with murder, but protesters demand the other three officers at the scene be prosecuted. All four were fired. “We’re not done,” said Darnella Wade, organizer for Black Lives Matter in neighboring St. Paul, where thousands gathered peacefully in front of the state Capitol. “They sent us the military, and we only asked them for arrests.” Minnesota’s governor brought in thousands of National Guard soldiers to help quell violence that had damaged or destroyed hundreds of buildings in Minneapolis over days of protests. The immense deployment appeared to have worked Saturday night, when there was comparatively little destruction. On Sunday, in a display of force, long lines of state patrolmen and National Guard soldiers were lined up in front of the Capitol, facing the demonstrators, with perhaps a dozen military-style armored vehicles behind them. For a second day, the protests reached to the White House, where chants could be heard from around 1,000 demonstrators just across the street in Lafayette Park as they faced police in riot gear behind barricades. The scene was defiant but peaceful, though police used flash bangs to stop another group from reaching the park. As the protests grew, President Trump retweeted conservative commentator Buck Sexton who called for “overwhelming force.” Outside the White House, Gabrielle Labrosse-Ellis, 30, from Maryland, held a sign that said, “Humanize black lives.” “This is unacceptable. This is the last straw,” she said. “It has to be.” Labrosse-Ellis said she planned to leave before dark because she feared a repeat of the violence that occurred Saturday night. Across America, demonstrators called again for an end to police violence and many joined police in pleading for an end to the looting Many also joined police in pleading for a stop to fires, vandalism and theft, saying it weakened calls for justice and reform. “They keep killing our people,” said Mahira Louis, 15, who marched with her mother and several hundred others through downtown Boston. “I’m so sick and tired of it.” Disgust over generations of racism in a country founded by slaveholders combined with a string of recent racially charged killings to stoke the anger. Adding to that was angst from months of lockdowns brought on by the coronavirus pandemic, which has disproportionately hurt communities of color, not only in terms of infections but in job losses and economic stress. The droves of people congregating for demonstrations threatened to trigger new outbreaks, a fact overshadowed by the boiling tensions. “Maybe this country will get the memo that we are sick of police murdering unarmed black men,” said Lex Scott, founder of Black Lives Matter Utah. “Maybe the next time a white police officer decides to pull the trigger, he will picture cities burning.” The scale of the protests, sweeping from coast to coast and unfolding on a single night, rivaled the historic demonstrations of the civil rights and Vietnam War eras. Curfews were imposed in major cities around the U.S., including Atlanta, Chicago, Denver, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Seattle. About 5,000 National Guard soldiers and airmen were activated in 15 states and Washington, D.C. But still trouble flared. There was looting on both ends of California, with video in San Jose showing several people in hoods and masks fleeing a Macy’s department store with large bags, while people in Long Beach carried away armloads of clothing and other goods from the smashed windows of stores at a shopping mall after curfew. As police moved in to try to restore order, some protesters ran in to confront the thieves and condemn them for undercutting the message of the demonstration. In tweets Sunday, Trump blamed anarchists and the media for fueling the violence. Attorney General William Barr pointed a finger at “far left extremist” groups. Police chiefs and politicians accused outsiders of coming in and causing the problems. At the Minneapolis intersection where Floyd was killed, people gathered with brooms and flowers, saying it was important to protect what they called a “sacred space.” The intersection was blocked with the traffic cones while a ring of flowers was laid out. Among those descending on Minneapolis was Michael Brown Sr., the father of Michael Brown, whose killing by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, set off unrest in 2014. “I understand what this family is feeling. I understand what this community is feeling,” he said. In Indianapolis, two people were reported dead in bursts of downtown violence, adding to deaths reported in Detroit and Minneapolis in recent days. Buildings around the U.S. were defaced with spray-painted messages, from the facade of St. Patrick’s Cathedral in New York to the historic Hay-Adams hotel near the White House. Some of Floyd’s gasped last words — “I can’t breathe” — were repeated, alongside anti-police messages. Send questions/comments to the editors. « Previous Next »",0.0

I sure would like to hear that we are all Americans, and we all need to stick together.” “A lot of people I ask to come on this show, to talk about this [such as] wealthy celebrities, wealthy political people, [say], ‘I can’t do it. I’m mad. I don’t want people to see me mad. It might hurt my business. I’m so upset that I had to go to my country house,'” Lemon said. “Where are you? Why aren’t you fighting for these young people? If you don’t do it now, when are you going to do it? . . . When the hell are you going to do it?” Lemon specifically referred to Oprah Winfrey, Jay-Z, Drake, Ellen DeGeneres, Anthony Anderson, Diddy, Jane Fonda, Tyler Perry, Tracee Ellis Ross and Kim Kardashian West. “Yes, I’m calling you out. You can be mad at me all you want. … Step up, people. Step up, black Hollywood,” Lemon said, adding, “Beyoncé released a message. You can’t?” Lemon was referring to an Instagram post in which the pop singer called for “justice for George Floyd” and urged people to sign a petition on Change.org that seeks to “reach the attention of Mayor Jacob Frey and DA Mike Freeman to beg to have the officers involved in this disgusting situation fired and for charges to be filed immediately.” Derek Chauvin, the former Minneapolis police office who knelt on the neck of Floyd, who cried that he could not breathe and later died, has been charged with murder. “We cannot normalize this pain. I’m not only speaking to people of color. If you’re white, black, brown or anything in between, I’m sure you feel hopeless by the racism going on in America right now,” Beyoncé said in the video. “There have been too many times that we’ve seen these violent killings and no consequences. Yeah, someone’s been charged, but justice is far from being achieved.” Contrary to Lemon’s comments, Beyoncé was far from the only star speaking out after the death of Floyd. Several celebrities took to the streets alongside protesters in various cities, including Anna Kendrick, J. Cole, Nick Cannon, Tinashe, Kendrick Sampson, Emily Ratajkowski, Sophia Bush, Machine Gun Kelly and Paris Jackson. Jamie Foxx joined the protests in Minneapolis Friday night after speaking at a news conference earlier in the day. “I think that what you saw on television, to watch this man plead for his life,” Foxx said. “As I sit with my two daughters, my nephews … what it does is, it overcomplicates everything as a black man trying to tell his son or his daughter how to function in life. Even the things that we’ve taught them don’t seem to work.” Pop star Halsey, who participated in a protest Saturday in Los Angeles, wrote in an Instagram story that police “opened fire of rubber bullets and tear gas multiple times on us” and that she was “hit twice. Once by pellets and once by shrapnel. We were gassed repeatedly for hours.” She added, “I will be returning.” Actor John Cusack protested Saturday in Chicago, tweeting throughout the event. “It’s nasty … out there,” he tweeted. “Everyone is on edge things burning – open looting – magnificent mile – and all over.” He shared videos of stores being looted, said he witnessed a reporter being teargassed and that police “tuned up my bike with their batons.” Many celebrities – including Steve Carell, Seth Rogen, Janelle Monáe and Don Cheadle – publicly donated to the Minnesota Freedom Fund, a nonprofit organization that helps disadvantaged individuals pay bail. Chrissy Teigen donated $200,000 to the organization. Others, meanwhile, spoke out in public forums. Rappers T.I. and Killer Mike gave impassioned speeches at the Atlanta mayor’s news conference Friday, urging protesters not to destroy property. “Atlanta is a place where we can set an example of prosperity, and we’ve done that for generations,” said T.I., calling the city “Wakanda,” referencing a fictional land from the Marvel universe. “It’s sacred. It must be protested.” Killer Mike noted that he has “a lot of love and respect for police officers,” as several members of his family served in law enforcement. “I don’t want to be here,” he said. But “I am duty-bound to be here to simply say that it is your duty not to burn your own house down for anger with an enemy. … After your burn down your own home, what do you have left but char and ash?” Send questions/comments to the editors. « Previous Next »",0.0

The store was near the place where Floyd was killed and it was heavily damaged during last week’s protests. Another store in Minneapolis remains closed, along with stores in Oakland, California; Atlanta; Philadelphia and Chicago. Target said it temporarily closed or adjusted hours at more than 200 stores over the weekend, but most were scheduled to reopen Sunday or Monday. CVS didn’t say how many stores it closed, but it said the shuttered locations are in more than 20 states and the District of Columbia. A spokeswoman for the company said pharmacies at closed stores will reroute customers to a nearby CVS so they can get prescriptions filled. “Employee and customer safety is our top priority, so we are continually monitoring protests as they occur in the communities we serve and will close stores, if needed, to help ensure the safety of employees and customers,” CVS said in a statement. Floyd, who was black and handcuffed, died while being arrested by Minneapolis police for suspicion of passing a counterfeit bill on May 25. Cellphone video showed that a white officer, Derek Chauvin, pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck for several minutes while Floyd pleaded for air and eventually stopped moving. Chauvin now faces murder and manslaughter charges. The other three officers who took part in the arrest were fired but haven’t been charged. “We are heartbroken by the death of George Floyd and the pain it is causing communities across the country,” Target said in a statement. “Our focus will remain on our team members’ safety and helping our community heal.” Target said employees at stores that are closed will be paid for up to 14 days, including premiums they are earning due to the pandemic.

As more beaches, churches, mosques, schools and businesses reopened worldwide, the sudden and mass civil unrest in the United States is raising fears of new virus outbreaks in a country that has more confirmed infections and deaths than any other. And it’s not just in the U.S. – London hosted a large anti-racism protest Sunday where demonstrators violated social distancing rules. Rosa Jimenez Cano said she planned to self-quarantine for 14 days, worrying she was perhaps “irresponsible” when she attended Saturday night’s protest in Miami, where she exposed herself to crowds of people. Protests over Floyd’s death – the latest in a series of killings of black men and women at the hands of police in America – have shaken the country from Minneapolis to New York, from Atlanta to Los Angeles. Some turned into riots and clashes with police, leaving stores in flames and torched cars in the streets. Health experts fear that silent carriers of the virus could unwittingly infect others at protests where people are packed cheek to jowl, many without masks, many chanting, singing or shouting. The virus is dispersed by microscopic droplets in the air when people cough, sneeze, sing or talk. “There’s no question that, when you put hundreds or thousands of people together in close proximity, when we have got this virus all over the streets … it’s not healthy,” Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan said Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union.” “Two weeks from now across America, we’re going to find out whether or not this gives us a spike and drives the numbers back up again or not.” The U.S. has seen over 1.7 million infections and nearly 104,000 deaths in the pandemic, which has disproportionately affected racial minorities in a nation that does not have universal health care. Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser said Sunday she was very concerned that the protests in the nation’s capital and elsewhere could provide fertile ground for a new series of outbreaks. Many of the protesters were wearing masks, but there were no attempts at social distancing. “We’ve been working very hard in these last eight to 10 weeks to not have any mass gatherings,” she said. “As a nation, we have to be concerned about a rebound.” Even the many protesters wearing masks are not guaranteed protection. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says cloth masks keep infected people from spreading the virus but are not designed to protect wearers from getting it. Mass protests in connection with Floyd’s death were also being held in Europe. In London, thousands of people marched Sunday chanting “No justice! No peace!” while carrying signs reading “Justice for George Floyd” and “Racism is a global issue.” Many demonstrators were not wearing masks and most in the crowd at Trafalgar Square were packed closely together. Britain has seen nearly 38,500 virus deaths, the second-highest in the world after the United States. In Berlin, hundreds of protesters picketed outside the U.S. Embassy on Saturday night under the motto: “Justice for George Floyd.” Others marched near the U.S. embassy in Copenhagen, Denmark. Many Americans returned Sunday to in-person church services for the first time in weeks and tens of thousands of mosques reopened across the Middle East, but countries from India to Colombia still saw rising numbers of new infections. Nearly 6.1 million infections have been reported worldwide, with nearly 370,000 people dying, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. The true death toll is believed to be significantly higher, since many victims died of the virus without ever being tested. The situation worsened Sunday in India, where new daily cases topped 8,000 for the first time and 193 more deaths were reported. Despite that, India still is easing restrictions on shops and public transport in more states beginning Monday, although subways and schools will remain closed. In Saudi Arabia, mosques reopened Sunday for the first time in more than two months, but Islam’s holiest site in Mecca remained closed. In Jerusalem, throngs of worshippers waited outside the Al-Aqsa Mosque before it reopened. Many wore surgical masks and waited for temperature checks as they entered. In Bogota, the capital of Colombia, authorities were locking down an area of nearly 1.5 million people as cases continued to rise. Mayor Claudia Lopez said no one in the working-class Kennedy area – inaugurated by the late U.S. President John F. Kennedy in 1961 – will be allowed out, except to seek food or medical care or in case of an emergency. Factories must also close. In Spain, Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez said Sunday that he would ask Parliament for a final two-week extension of the nation’s state of emergency that is set to expire on June 7. That allows the government to keep ordering lockdown measures to control its coronavirus outbreak, which has claimed at least 27,000 lives, many of them in overwhelmed nursing homes. “We have almost reached safe harbor,” Sánchez said. At the Vatican, Pope Francis cautioned people against being pessimistic as they emerge from coronavirus lockdowns. During Mass in St. Peter’s Basilica to mark Pentecost Sunday, Francis noted a tendency to say that “nothing will return as before.” That kind of thinking, Francis said, guarantees that “the one thing that certainly does not return is hope.” Send questions/comments to the editors. « Previous Next » filed under:",0.0
1621761065,2020-05-31 17:17:14,Trump says he’ll label Antifa a terror organization amid unrest,https://www.pressherald.com/2020/05/31/trump-says-hell-label-antifa-a-terror-organization-amid-unrest/,en,False,,366984,pressherald.com,http://pressherald.com/,"WASHINGTON — President Trump said Sunday that he was designating Antifa as a domestic terrorism organization after another night of violent protests over racism and police violence erupted in cities across the nation. The practical effect of the president’s declaration was unclear. While domestic terrorism is defined in the 2001 Patriot Act bill – and law enforcement could use the designation to seek enhanced powers to investigate members of the group – there are no current designated domestic terrorist organizations. There’s also no explicit law against providing support to domestic terrorist organizations – unlike groups designated as foreign terrorist organizations. The Antifa movement is largely decentralized, with activists organizing their protest activities online or in small, decentralized groups. Antifa is short for “anti-fascist” and sometimes used to describe militant left-wing political activists. “The violence instigated and carried out by Antifa and other similar groups in connection with the rioting is domestic terrorism and will be treated accordingly,” Attorney General William Barr said in a statement. Barr didn’t say he was giving the group a designation, only that he was assigning the Department of Justice’s existing counterterrorism task forces to look into it. Civil rights groups protested the Trump administration’s actions. “Terrorism is an inherently political label, easily abused and misused. There is no legal authority for designating a domestic group. Any such designation would raise significant due process and First Amendment concerns,” Hina Shamsi, ACLU National Security Project Director, said in an emailed statement. For the president, the symbolic gesture was the latest in an increasingly provocative series of responses to protests that have broken out in the aftermath of the death of George Floyd, an unarmed black man, in Minneapolis police custody. The National Guard was deployed Saturday in more than a dozen states and the District of Columbia, with mayors in cities across the country enacting curfews and pleading for calm. Trump also tweeted that Minnesota authorities should have immediately called in the National Guard to address protests, and blamed members of the media for unrest. Critics have said the president has fanned the flames of unrest in a series of statements and tweets. On Saturday, Trump threatened to unleash the “unlimited power” of the U.S. military on demonstrators, despite legal restrictions on domestic activity, and defended the “overwhelming majority” of police whom he said are “incredible in every way.” “No one is more upset than fellow law enforcement officers by the small handful who fail to abide by their oath to serve and protect,” the president said. Trump also threatened protesters outside the White House with “vicious dogs” and “ominous weapons,” while inviting his supporters to demonstrate there on Saturday night. That prompted concern of possible clashes between protesters and Trump’s backers. While a pro-Trump contingent didn’t materialize, hundreds of protesters circled the White House while smaller groups looted nearby stores and restaurants, and lit fires in the streets. Trump last year had threatened to designate Antifa as an “organization of terror” after leftist demonstrations made public their plans to confront a group of far-right activists with links to the 2017 white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Va. A pair of Republican senators – Bill Cassidy of Louisiana and Ted Cruz of Texas – have also advocated for congressional action that would symbolically designate Antifa as a terrorist organization.

1621772939,2020-05-31 17:26:45,"Hundreds of protesters mass outside Portland police station, block traffic",https://www.pressherald.com/2020/05/31/protesters-engage-in-standoff-outside-portland-police-station/,en,False,,366984,pressherald.com,http://pressherald.com/,"More than 300 protesters marched the streets of Portland and demonstrated for hours outside the Portland police station Sunday afternoon, demanding to meet with Chief Frank Clark to discuss their concerns about racial bias after a black man’s death at the hands of Minneapolis police. Early Sunday evening the protesters blocked several streets around the police station and in the Old Port, but they dispersed about 7:30 p.m. without having met with Clark. Organizers said they would return on Monday. Attempts to reach the police chief were unsuccessful Sunday night, and a spokesman said he didn’t know why Clark didn’t meet with the protesters. Police said that no arrests were made during Sunday’s demonstrations. The death of George Floyd has sparked protests across the country, and in Portland hundreds of demonstrators marched down Congress Street on Sunday, chanting, “No justice, no peace! No racist police!” After walking to the Cumberland County Jail earlier in the afternoon, protesters stopped at the intersection of Congress and St. John streets and held two minutes of silence for a man, Chance David Baker, who was shot dead by a Portland police officer in 2017 at Union Station Plaza. In the days after his death, Black Lives Matter activists rallied to protest the killing of Baker, who was biracial, a light-skinned man with pale blue eyes. The Maine Attorney General’s Office, which investigates all police-involved shootings in the state, later ruled that the shooting was justified. After the observance for Baker on Sunday, the protesters moved to the police station on Middle Street. “What we’re fighting for is justice. What we’re fighting for is peace,” said an organizer who declined to give his name. Police officers stood at the top of the steps leading to the police station, and Lt. Robert Doherty addressed the crowd, telling them the department shared the goal of keeping people safe. Still, he asked protesters to disperse for public safety during the coronavirus pandemic. “We want everyone in front of us to be safe and everyone behind us to be safe,” Doherty said. Protesters demanded that Chief Clark come out to speak. Doherty asked that they agree to disperse after Clark spoke. They refused, and fanned out to neighboring intersections, where they formed human chains and lay on the pavement to block traffic. Around 8 p.m. Sunday, after protestors had dispersed, about a dozen Portland officers, each wearing rubber gloves, came out of the Middle Street building and removed a pile of cardboard signs that had been stacked on the sidewalk next to the station. The officers walked past an underground garage door to the police station that had been defaced with graffiti chalk. The messages read, “There are no good cops, RIP George Floyd, Silence is Violence, and Trayvon Martin.” Martin was the 17-year-old African American teenager who was shot and killed in Florida in 2012 by George Zimmerman for allegedly acting suspiciously. The protest Sunday was one of several days’ demonstrations over Floyd’s death. On Friday, hundreds of people marched through downtown Portland in two protests that concluded peacefully, with officers blocking traffic and clearing paths for people to walk. Chief Clark on Friday called the conduct of the Minnesota police officer whose knee was on Floyd’s neck “unacceptable.” Clark, Officer Les Smith, president of the Police Benevolent Association, and Sgt. Eric Nevins, president of the Supervisory Officers’ Association, issued an open letter to the community on Friday. “As human beings and law enforcement professionals, we are saddened and deeply disturbed by the recent and tragic police-involved fatality in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and the negative impacts such incidents have not only upon the trust of our profession, but within our broader communities as well,” the statement reads. “Our hearts go out to George Floyd’s family and friends, and we, like many, are awaiting answers and justice.” The Minneapolis police officer, Derek Chauvin, kneeled on Floyd’s neck for several minutes, despite repeated pleas by Floyd that he couldn’t breathe. Chauvin was arrested Friday and charged with third-degree murder. “My first reaction was what if that was my brother or father or son?” Clark said in an interview Friday. “To say it was disturbing is probably an understatement.” But despite protesters’ calls to see the chief, he did not appear on Sunday. As Sunday evening wore on, groups of protesters blocked intersections all along Congress and Middle streets in the Old Port, from Franklin Street to Temple Street. At the intersection of Middle and Exchange streets, a man in a pickup truck revved his engine at protesters blocking his way, sending up a cloud of exhaust smoke. After a shouting match, he backed up along the one-way street to get away. A protester with his face covered by a bandanna zipped back and forth along Middle Street on a motorcycle, doing doughnuts and making screeching sounds with his tires. People chanted, “Black lives matter” and “This is what democracy looks like.” Related Hundreds take to Portland streets Friday to protest Minneapolis police killing Over and over, the protesters called on white Mainers to support people of color and fight for policing reform. “I’m sickened by the killing of George Floyd, and as a white person I wanted to show up,” Erin Brown of Portland said. “I don’t want it to be their problem. It’s all of our problem.” After more than an hour of blocking streets throughout the Old Port, protesters faced a decision about whether to stay and what to ask for. Leaders of the demonstration appeared to argue. “What are we doing? What are we even asking for? It’s all so nebulous,” one woman shouted at a male organizer while both were standing in the intersection of Middle and Market streets. He replied that they wanted a conversation with a police chief, and justice for Baker, the man who was shot in 2017. Nearby, two police officers stepped out of their parked cruiser to speak to protesters. “We put ourselves on the line for you. We would die for you,” Officer Darrel Gibson said to the group. “I don’t even know you and I would die for you.” “It’s just a uniform,” the officer next to him said. “We don’t trust the uniform,” a protester said. For a moment, the confrontation appeared ready to escalate. A chain of protesters with linked arms blocked the stairs leading to the police station. Each wrote a phone number on their arm – someone to bail them out if they were arrested, they said. At one point, a boy outside the police station picked up a rock. Other protesters noticed and shouted at him to put it down. No violence occurred that a reporter present could see. Protesters repeatedly emphasized that they were committed to nonviolence. Some protesters wrote chalk messages on the brick and concrete exterior of the station, which soon was practically covered. “Stop killing us,” one message said. Eventually protesters decided to disperse, but first gathered again outside the police station on Middle Street to regroup and discuss plans to come back. Speaking through a megaphone, Mary Tadsse, an organizer from Portland, recalled a confrontation with an unfriendly driver that evening who had tried to get through their cordon blocking the road. She likened the protesters’ solidarity in that moment to the unity she said communities need to stop racial bias in policing. “We came together and stayed there, and he backed up, and that’s why we’re here today,” she said. Other protesters took the megaphone to discuss future plans. They announced that another protest would take place on Monday, with the details to be decided and spread around town via social media. After several minutes chanting “I can’t breathe” and “Black Lives Matter,” and briefly, with middle fingers raised, “(Expletive) the police,” the crowd dispersed. In an interview afterward, Tadsse urged white people who didn’t make it to the protest to come out next time. “Come fight with us,” she said. “It’s not that hard to get out of your homes.” Tadsse said Clark’s absence showed police didn’t take their concerns seriously. Asked what protesters wanted from the police, she said that they wanted to know that authorities were listening to the community’s anger and concern about racial bias in policing. “Listen to us. Change,” she said. Staff Writer Dennis Hoey contributed to this report. Send questions/comments to the editors. « Previous Next » filed under:",0.0

U.S. law allows terrorist designations for foreign groups since belonging to those groups doesn't enjoy the same protections. Antifa, short for anti-fascists, describes a broad group of people whose positions can be hard to define, but many members support oppressed populations and protest the amassing of wealth by corporations and elites. Some employ radical or militant tactics to get their message across. Typically, groups who identify as Antifa are amorphous and don't have a central leadership, though some local activists are highly organized, according to federal law enforcement officials. That has made it difficult for U.S. law enforcement to deal with violence from members of groups that label themselves as Antifa. Federal law enforcement officials told CNN they are aware of outside groups who are behind some of the property destruction and violence, using the cover of the legitimate protests in Minneapolis and elsewhere. Those domestic extremist groups include anarchists, white supremacists and far-left extremists, some of whom have overlapping affiliations.An announcement by the Justice Department on Sunday to use Joint Terrorism Task Forces around the country to investigate some of the violence in major cities singles out leftist Antifa activity, though U.S. law enforcement officials say there are groups from both the extremist left and right involved in the riots and attacks on police. In response to the president's tweet, ACLU National Security Project Director Hina Shamsi said there is ""no legal authority for designating a domestic group"" as a terrorist organization.""As this tweet demonstrates, terrorism is an inherently political label, easily abused and misused. There is no legal authority for designating a domestic group. Any such designation would raise significant due process and First Amendment concerns.""The Justice Department has studied the issue of creating a domestic terrorism law to apply to people involved in violence and who belong to domestic extremist groups, but the constitutional issues have been a hurdle to that effort.",0.0

Advertisement What is Antifa? Share Shares Copy Link Copy As protests over George Floyd's death spread across the country, officials have blamed the violent nature of some demonstrations on members of a controversial group known as Antifa.President Donald Trump on Sunday said the United States would designate Antifa a terrorist organization, though the federal government has no legal authority to label a wholly domestic group the way it designates foreign terrorist organizations.Speaking at the Kennedy Space Center on Saturday, Trump said the recent ""violence and vandalism"" seen across the country ""is being led by Antifa and other radical left-wing groups who are terrorizing the innocent, destroying jobs, hurting businesses and burning down buildings.""The president did not provide any evidence for his assertion.National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien echoed Trump's comments on CNN's ""State of the Union"" Sunday morning, telling Jake Tapper that the violence ""is being driven by Antifa.""CNN has not independently verified whether the group is involved in recent protests.Here's a closer look at Antifa protesters, who have become more visible in the last several years.What is Antifa?Antifa is short for anti-fascists. The term is used to define a broad group of people whose political beliefs lean toward the left — often the far left — but do not conform with the Democratic Party platform. The group doesn't have an official leader or headquarters, although groups in certain states hold regular meetings.Antifa positions can be hard to define, but many members support oppressed populations and protest the amassing of wealth by corporations and elites. Some employ radical or militant tactics to get their message across.Scott Crow, a former Antifa organizer, says the ""radical ideals"" promoted by Antifas are starting to be adopted by liberals. ""They would never have looked at (those ideals) before, because they saw us as the enemy as much as the right-wingers.""The majority of Antifa members don't fall into a stereotype. Since the election of President Trump, however, most new Antifa members are young voters.How did the group start?The exact origins of the group are unknown, but Antifa can be traced to Nazi Germany and Anti-Fascist Action, a militant group founded in the 1980s in the United Kingdom.Modern-day Antifa members have become more active in making themselves known at public rallies and within the progressive movement, says Brian Levin, director of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino.""What they're trying to do now is not only become prominent through violence at these high-profile rallies, but also to reach out through small meetings and through social networking to cultivate disenfranchised progressives who heretofore were peaceful,"" Levin said.Where do they protest?Members have been spotted at high-profile, right-wing events across the country.In August 2017 members of the group showed up in Charlottesville, Virginia, to condemn racism and counter protest hundreds of white nationalists opposed to the removal of a Gen. Robert E. Lee statue. The protests turned violent when James Fields, who is not a member of Antifa, plowed his car through a crowd of counter protesters, killing Heather Heyer.Video above: President Trump Says There Were 'Bad Dudes on the Other Side' in CharlottesvilleEarlier that year, Antifa protested the appearance of Milo Yiannopoulos, an alt-right provocateur, at the University of California, Berkeley. They also protested President Trump's inauguration in 2017.While it can be difficult to distinguish Antifa activists from other protesters, some dress head to toe in black. Members call this the ""Black Bloc.""They also wear masks to hide their identities from the police and whomever they are protesting.Why are they controversial?The group is known for causing damage to property during protests. In Berkeley, black-clad protesters wearing masks threw Molotov cocktails and smashed windows at the student union center where the Yiannopoulos event was to be held.Crow, who was involved with Antifa for almost 30 years, said members use violence as a means of self-defense and they believe property destruction does not equate to violence.""There is a place for violence. Is that the world that we want to live in? No. Is it the world we want to inhabit? No. Is it the world we want to create? No. But will we push back? Yes,"" Crow said.Levin said Antifa activists feel the need to partake in violence because ""they believe that elites are controlling the government and the media. So they need to make a statement head-on against the people who they regard as racist.""""There's this 'It's going down' mentality and this 'Hit them with your boots' mentality that goes back many decades to confrontations that took place, not only here in the American South, but also in places like Europe,"" he added.White nationalists and other members of the so-called alt-right have denounced members of Antifa, sometimes calling them the ""alt-left."" Many white nationalists from the Charlottesville rallies claimed it was the Antifa groups that led the protests to turn violent.Peter Cvjetanovic, a white nationalist who attended the Virginia protests, said he believes the far left, including Antifa, are ""just as dangerous, if not more dangerous than the right wing could ever be.""""These are people who preach tolerance and love while at the same time threatening people with a different political ideology. We go to our rallies and they harass us and attack us but they held theirs and we ignore them. You don't see right-wing protests get like this,"" Cvjetanovic told KRNV.But Crow said the philosophy of Antifa is based on the idea of direct action. ""The idea in Antifa is that we go where they (right-wingers) go. That hate speech is not free speech. That if you are endangering people with what you say and the actions that are behind them, then you do not have the right to do that.""And so we go to cause conflict, to shut them down where they are, because we don't believe that Nazis or fascists of any stripe should have a mouthpiece.""",0.0

George Floyd, 46, died last Monday after Officer Derek Chauvin, 44, of the Minneapolis Police Department was videotaped kneeling on Floyd’s neck as Floyd was handcuffed and on the ground, pleading for air. Floyd of Minneapolis was pronounced dead at the scene. Chauvin was arrested and charged Friday with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. At Sunday’s demonstration in Skowhegan, protesters held signs while many drivers crossing the Margaret Chase Bridge honked and waved to show support. “We’re out here demonstrating against this ongoing police brutality,” said Aliza Jones, one of the protest’s organizers. “This group has a lot of teachers, retired teachers, health care workers. “A lot of us also had to do with changing the mascot at the high school. Some of us are involved with the LGBT community, so everyone out here works with the community, so we felt that we needed to come out here and stand together.” Jones’ Delilah, 9, was also in attendance. “I spoke with her a lot about all of this,” Jones said. “And she wanted to come out here and show her support, too.” Jones said the protest came together in just 24 hours, with people spreading the word in conversations and Facebook posts. Teacher Lori Swenson was among the protesters and said her decision to attend was based solely on the responsibility she feels to set an example for her third-grade students at Bloomfield Elementary School in Skowhegan. “As a teacher, we do a lot of teaching our children that you don’t judge by anything that’s different,” Swenson said. “And how could I teach that and not come out here and protest against this? “We’re role models for our children, and it’s important for people to get out there and show that we support people of all colors, religions and abilities. We need to show that we are all people. We’re all the same under our skin.” Morrigan Knox-McCleod, an activist from Norridgewock, held back tears as she held a sign that read: “Black Lives Always Matter” and “9-Minutes,” the latter reportedly being the amount of time Chauvin had his knee on the back of Floyd’s neck. “Black men and women are being killed on the streets, while a man with his hands in his pockets looks on in pride,” Knox-McCleod said. “We shouldn’t be fighting this anymore, and I hope that as humans, we learn that we’re all equal and that everybody deserves basic human decency and rights. Until they have them, we will fight. That’s why we’re here.” The events leading up to Floyd’s death began when Minneapolis police received a report of a man matching Floyd’s description attempting to use a fraudulent bill at a convenience store. After Floyd was detained, Chauvin kneeled on his neck as three other officers looked on. Each of the officers was fired following Floyd’s death. As of Sunday, however, Chauvin was the only officer charged with a crime. Chauvin has also been accused of ignoring the other officers’ concerns about Floyd, and continuing to kneel on Floyd’s neck until the suspect lost consciousness. “I hope people realize that people of color are being oppressed. We’ve known that for obviously a long time, but now is the time to speak up because people are being murdered,” protester Elizabeth Rich-Colton said. “People of color need to have a voice, but we need to be more than just sitting in the background saying, ‘We support you.’ We need to show it.” Since Floyd’s death, protests and demonstrations have been held in Minneapolis and several other cities or smaller communities nationwide. Many of the protests began as calm gatherings that grew violent. Some have seen protestors looting business and causing extensive damage to municipal and private property. On Friday, the same day Chauvin’s was arrested, hundreds of protesters descended onto the streets of Portland, marching from City Hall to the Police Department on Middle Street and to Monument Square. Police said the protest was without incident. “I was really bummed when I saw the march in Portland and I couldn’t make it, so I knew I had to come today,” said Adelle Belanger of Cornville. “I’ve been seeing a lot of stuff on social media, obviously, and I really just wanted to do something. “It’s really important that people, especially people who are not people of color, show that they are with people of color in times like these. We all need to gather together and actually doing something. I mean, people have been marching for the same issue, basically, since America has been founded.

Teacher Lori Swenson was among the protesters and said her decision to attend was based solely on the responsibility she feels to set an example for her third-grade students at Bloomfield Elementary School in Skowhegan. “As a teacher, we do a lot of teaching our children that you don’t judge by anything that’s different,” Swenson said. “And how could I teach that and not come out here and protest against this? “We’re role models for our children, and it’s important for people to get out there and show that we support people of all colors, religions and abilities. We need to show that we are all people. We’re all the same under our skin.” Morrigan Knox-McCleod, an activist from Norridgewock, held back tears as she held a sign that read: “Black Lives Always Matter” and “9-Minutes,” the latter reportedly being the amount of time Chauvin had his knee on the back of Floyd’s neck. “Black men and women are being killed on the streets, while a man with his hands in his pockets looks on in pride,” Knox-McCleod said. “We shouldn’t be fighting this anymore, and I hope that as humans, we learn that we’re all equal and that everybody deserves basic human decency and rights. Until they have them, we will fight. That’s why we’re here.” The events leading up to Floyd’s death began when Minneapolis police received a report of a man matching Floyd’s description attempting to use a fraudulent bill at a convenience store. After Floyd was detained, Chauvin kneeled on his neck as three other officers looked on. Each of the officers was fired following Floyd’s death. As of Sunday, however, Chauvin was the only officer charged with a crime. Chauvin has also been accused of ignoring the other officers’ concerns about Floyd, and continuing to kneel on Floyd’s neck until he lost consciousness. “I hope people realize that people of color are being oppressed. We’ve known that for obviously a long time, but now is the time to speak up because people are being murdered,” protester Elizabeth Rich-Colton said. “People of color need to have a voice, but we need to be more than just sitting in the background saying, ‘We support you.’ We need to show it.” Since Floyd’s death, protests and demonstrations have been held in Minneapolis and several other cities or smaller communities nationwide. Many of the protests began as calm gatherings that grew violent. Some have seen protestors looting business and causing extensive damage to municipal and private property. On Friday, the same day Chauvin’s was arrested, hundreds of protesters descended onto the streets of Portland, marching from City Hall to the Police Department on Middle Street and to Monument Square. Police said the protest was without incident. “I was really bummed when I saw the march in Portland and I couldn’t make it, so I knew I had to come today,” said Adelle Belanger of Cornville. “I’ve been seeing a lot of stuff on social media, obviously, and I really just wanted to do something. “It’s really important that people, especially people who are not people of color, show that they are with people of color in times like these. We all need to gather together and actually doing something. I mean, people have been marching for the same issue, basically, since America has been founded. There have been injustices and things have not been equal.” Molly Shelly — 207-861-9256 [email protected] Twitter: @mollyshellyyy Send questions/comments to the editors. « Previous Next »",0.0

George Floyd, 46, died last Monday after Officer Derek Chauvin, 44, of the Minneapolis Police Department was videotaped kneeling on Floyd’s neck as Floyd was handcuffed and on the ground, pleading for air. Floyd of Minneapolis was pronounced dead at the scene. Chauvin was arrested and charged Friday with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter.

1621793041,2020-05-31 18:19:12,"Officials see extremist groups, disinformation in protests",https://www.pressherald.com/2020/05/31/officials-see-extremist-groups-disinformation-in-protests/,en,False,,366984,pressherald.com,http://pressherald.com/,"WASHINGTON — U.S. officials sought to determine Sunday whether extremist groups had infiltrated police brutality protests across the country and deliberately tipped largely peaceful demonstrations toward violence — and if foreign adversaries were behind a burgeoning disinformation campaign on social media. As demonstrations spread from Minneapolis to the White House, New York City and overseas, federal law enforcement officials insisted far-left groups were stoking violence. Meanwhile, experts who track extremist groups also reported seeing evidence of the far-right at work. Investigators were also tracking online interference and looking into whether foreign agents were behind the effort. Officials have seen a surge of social media accounts with fewer than 200 followers created in the last month, a textbook sign of a disinformation effort. The accounts have posted graphic images of the protests, material on police brutality and material on the coronavirus pandemic that appeared designed to inflame tensions across the political divide, according to three administration officials. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss investigations. The investigations are an attempt to identify the network of forces behind some of the most widespread outbreak of civil unrest in the U.S. in decades. Protests erupted in dozens of cities in recent days, triggered by the death of George Floyd, who died after he was pinned at the neck by a white Minneapolis police officer. Pandemic-weary Americans were already angry — about COVID-19 deaths, lockdown orders and tens of millions of people out of work. The pandemic has hit African Americans harder than whites in the U.S., and the killings of black people by police have continued over the years even as the topic faded from the national stage. But there are signs of people with other disparate motives, including anarchist graffiti, arrests of some out-of-state protesters, and images circulating in extremist groups that suggest the involvement of outside groups. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said Sunday that state authorities were hit with a cyber attack as law enforcement prepared to diffuse protests in Minneapolis and St. Paul, the epicenter of the unrest. He described it as a “very sophisticated denial of service attack on all computers.” President Trump, Attorney General William Bar and others have said the left-wing extremist group antifa is to blame. Short for anti-fascists, antifa is an umbrella term for far-left-leaning militant groups that resist neo-Nazis and white supremacists at demonstrations. Barr on Sunday said the FBI would use its regional joint terrorism task forces to “identify criminal organizers,” and Trump threatened again to name antifa a terrorist group. The Justice Department is also deploying members of the U.S. Marshals Service and agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration on Sunday to supplement National Guard troops outside the White House, a senior department official said. The official was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. The addition of the federal agents, who will have armored vehicles, came as Barr warned that prosecutors could seek to use terrorism statutes against “violent radical agitators” who attempt to hijack protests to cause destruction. An antifa activist group disseminated a message in a Telegram channel on Saturday that encouraged people to consider Minnesota National Guard troops “easy targets,” two Defense Department officials said. The message encouraged activists to steal “kit,” meaning the weapons and body armor used by the soldiers. The officials were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. As a result, soldiers with the Minnesota National Guard were armed during their mission at protests across the state Sunday, the officials said. The soldiers are sometimes armed but had not been since they moved into parts of the state that had been besieged by riots in the last few days. The troops do not have the authority to make arrests, and are there to act mostly as extra security for police. Others have seen evidence of right-wing extremists. J.J. MacNab, a fellow at George Washington University’s Program on Extremism, has been monitoring chatter about the protests among anti-government extremists on social media platforms. She has access to dozens of private Facebook groups for followers of the loosely organized “Boogaloo” movement, which uses an ’80s movie sequel as a code word for a second civil war. She also has been poring over images from the weekend protests and spotted some “boogaloo bois” in the crowds, carrying high-powered rifles and wearing tactical gear. “They want to co-opt them in order to start their war. They see themselves as being on the side of protesters and that the protesters themselves are useful in causing anarchy,” MacNab said. She also sees signs that the Three Percenters militia movement appears to be taking an interest. Megan Squire, an Elon University computer science professor who tracks online extremism, saw images of at least four members of the far-right Proud Boys group on the periphery of a protest Saturday night in Raleigh, North Carolina. Trump was expected in the coming days to draw distinctions between the legitimate anger of peaceful protesters and the unacceptable actions of violent agitators, said a White House official who was not authorized to discuss the plans ahead of time and spoke on condition of anonymity. The Trump administration has largely remained silent on local reports that far-right protesters were also involved. Meanwhile, Democratic mayors said Trump’s handling of the crisis was reminiscent of one of the darkest moments of his presidency — when he said there were “good people on both sides” of protests in 2017 over white supremacists demonstrating in Charlottesville, Virginia. America’s racial fault lines are a perfect opportunity for foreign adversaries looking to sow discord and portray the U.S. in a negative light, according to James Ludes, director of the Pell Center for International Relations and Public Policy at Salve Regina University in Rhode Island. “This is a real issue and Americans are legitimately upset about it,” said Ludes, who studies foreign disinformation tactics. “That’s one of the hallmarks of these campaigns. You don’t create new issues, you exploit existing issues.” There’s a history of this. In 2016, another black man, Philando Castile, was killed by police in a Minneapolis suburb, his death livestreamed on Facebook. Russians used a fake Black Lives Matter page to confuse and stoke anger among the protesters. There were nearly 700,000 followers, but it’s not clear how many were real. One debunked example from this week: That Atlanta had deployed a “child militia.” Floyd was accused of trying to pass a bad bill at a grocery store after he was laid off in the pandemic. Disturbing video showed him prone on the street, while a white police officer pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck even as he cried he couldn’t breathe. He later died. The officers have been fired; Derek Chauvin, the officer who pinned Floyd in the video, was charged with murder. At first there were peaceful demonstrations, but violence soon erupted. A Minneapolis police station was torched and protests took off around the country, growing increasingly tense. Video showed a police vehicle ramming into demonstrators in New York. Meanwhile, a van with four New York Police Department officers inside was hit with a Molotov cocktail and torched. Hundreds have been arrested nationwide and cities braced for more protests. But booking information from the county jail in Minneapolis, for example, showed that out of 59 protest-related arrests, 47 people had a home address in Minnesota, with the majority coming from the Twin Cities. Before protests began in New York City, organizers of anarchist groups began raising money for bail, recruited medical teams to deploy for violent interactions with police and planned how to target high-end stores, said John Miller, the NYPD’s deputy commissioner of intelligence and counterterrorism. Scouts on bicycles would also move ahead of the groups to report where the police would be and then direct small breakaway groups to areas where they could torch police cars or throw Molotov cocktails, Miller said. The NYPD has arrested 786 people related to protests since May 28 and 1 in 7 of them were not from New York City, he said. In Washington, where protesters raged outside the White House, most of the 17 people arrested were from the area. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser said the groups seemed, at the least, organized to destroy with tools to break windows and distribute materials. Send questions/comments to the editors. « Previous Next »",0.0

The turbulence sparked by the death of George Floyd — a black man who died after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed a knee into his neck for several minutes — shook not only the streets of New York and Los Angeles, but dozens of smaller communities such as Fargo, North Dakota, and Lincoln, Nebraska. The damage extended even to buildings near the White House. ""They keep killing our people,"" said Mahira Louis, 15, who marched with her mother and several hundred others through downtown Boston on Sunday. ""I'm so sick and tired of it."" Peaceful protests involving tens of thousands of people on Saturday gave way, in some places, to violence, with police vehicles torched, stores emptied and objects hurled at officers. The police response varied from restrained to aggressive, with officers at times firing tear gas and rubber bullets. Police and peaceful protesters alike pleaded for a stop to violence, saying it weakened calls for justice and reform. ""It only hurts the cause,"" said Danielle Outlaw, head of the police force in Philadelphia, where more than 200 people were arrested as fires and looting engulfed the heart of the city. Disgust over generations of racism in a country founded by slaveholders combined with a string of recent racially charged killings to stoke the anger. Adding to that was angst from months of lockdowns brought on by the coronavirus pandemic, which has disproportionately hurt communities of color, not only in terms of infections but in job losses and economic stress. The droves of people congregating for demonstrations threatened to trigger new outbreaks, a fact overshadowed by the boiling tensions. ""Maybe this country will get the memo that we are sick of police murdering unarmed black men,"" said Lex Scott, founder of Black Lives Matter Utah. ""Maybe the next time a white police officer decides to pull the trigger, he will picture cities burning."" The scale of the protests, sweeping from coast to coast and unfolding on a single night, rivaled the historic demonstrations of the civil rights and Vietnam War eras. Curfews were imposed in major cities around the U.S., including Atlanta, Chicago, Denver, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Seattle. About 5,000 National Guard soldiers and airmen were activated in 15 states and Washington, D.C. In Minneapolis, police, state troopers and National Guard members showed new force Saturday in breaking up demonstrations after three days of police largely avoiding engaging protesters. Dozens of protests were underway or expected Sunday, from Miami to Kansas City to San Francisco. They went forth largely without incident, but sparks of crime continued. In Philadelphia, people robbed stores in broad daylight, and at least one more police vehicle was set ablaze. Streets leading downtown were closed. Chicago likewise restricted downtown access and called in the National Guard. At the Minneapolis intersection where Floyd was killed, people gathered with brooms and flowers, saying it was important to protect what they called a ""sacred space."" The intersection was blocked with the traffic cones while a ring of flowers was laid out. Among those descending on Minneapolis was Michael Brown Sr., the father of Michael Brown, whose killing by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, set off unrest in 2014. ""I understand what this family is feeling. I understand what this community is feeling,"" he said. County Commissioner Angela Conley said the demonstrations and confrontations with police would continue until the other three officers who were at the scene when Floyd was pinned down are arrested and prosecuted. The officer who held his knee on Floyd's neck, Derek Chauvin, was charged last week with murder. All four officers have been fired. ""We'll continue to have this militarized presence in our community until justice is done,"" Conley said. In tweets Sunday, President Donald Trump blamed anarchists and the media for fueling the violence. Attorney General William Barr pointed a finger at ""far left extremist"" groups. Police chiefs and politicians accused outsiders of coming in and causing the problems. Few parts of America were untouched. Protesters set fires inside Reno's city hall, and police launched tear gas at rock-throwing demonstrators in Fargo, North Dakota. In Salt Lake City, demonstrators flipped a police car and lit it on fire. Police said six people were arrested and an officer was injured after being struck in the head with a baseball bat. By Sunday, the fury had spread to Europe, where thousands gathered in London's Trafalgar Square, clapping and waving placards despite government rules barring crowds because of the COVID-19 pandemic. In New York, a video Saturday showed two police cruisers lurching into a crowd of demonstrators who were pushing a barricade against one of them and pelting it with objects. Several people were knocked to the ground. It was unclear if anyone was hurt. ""The mistakes that are happening are not mistakes. They're repeated violent terrorist offenses, and people need to stop killing black people,"" Brooklyn protester Meryl Makielski said. In Indianapolis, two people were reported dead in bursts of downtown violence, adding to deaths reported in Detroit and Minneapolis in recent days. Buildings around the U.S. were defaced with spray-painted messages, from the facade of St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York to the historic Hay-Adams hotel near the White House. Some of Floyd's gasped last words — ""I can't breathe"" — were repeated, alongside anti-police messages. Crews near the White House worked to replace windows that had been shattered with large pieces of wood. Buildings for blocks were marked with graffiti, including curses about Trump. Shattered glass still covered the sidewalks. The damaged buildings included the Department of Veterans Affairs, directly across the street from the White House. Some leaders prepared to put more soldiers in the streets. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp authorized the deployment of up to 3,000 National Guard troops to Athens, Savannah and any other cities where more demonstrations were planned. Kemp had already approved up to 1,500 Guardsmen to help enforce a 9 p.m. Saturday curfew in Atlanta. This week's unrest recalled the riots in Los Angeles nearly 30 years ago after the acquittal of the white police officers who beat Rodney King, a black motorist who had led them on a high-speed chase. The protests of Floyd's killing have gripped many more cities, but the losses have yet to approach the staggering totals LA saw during five days of rioting in 1992, when more than 60 people died, 2,000-plus were injured and thousands arrested, with property damage topping $1 billion.",0.0

Asked if was giving up his title, he tweeted “Yes.” When one of Jones’ 2.3 million Twitter followers suggested he was hurting himself more than the UFC, Jones replied: “I hurt myself every time I walk out there and take a punch to the head and not feel my pay is worth it anymore.” Jones, 32, had been eyeing a fight with heavyweight Francis Ngannou, but said the UFC did not want to pay him enough. UFC President Dana White said the fighter wanted “crazy” money, citing demands of $15 million, $20 million and $30 million. “He can do whatever he wants to do. He can sit out, he can fight, he can whatever,” White said Saturday night after an event in Las Vegas. “Jon Jones can say whatever he wants publicly. It’s his God-given right here in America. He can say whatever he wants. And when he’s ready to come back and fight, he can.” SOCCER MLS: The Major League Soccer Players Association voted to approve economic concessions for this season, including across-the-board salary cuts, while also agreeing to play in a proposed summer tournament in Orlando, Florida. The proposal, made public by the union Sunday night, will now be sent to back to the league for approval by team owners. GERMANY: Four young players in the Bundesliga addressed the death of George Floyd in the United States during this weekend’s games. England’s 20-year-old winger Jadon Sancho and 21-year-old Morocco right-back Achraf Hakimi showed T-shirts with the handwritten message “Justice for George Floyd” after scoring goals in Borussia Dortmund’s 6-1 win Sunday at Paderborn, following the example set by Schalke’s American midfielder Weston McKennie, 21, who wore an armband with the same message on Saturday. Marcus Thuram, a 22-year-old Frenchman, took a knee after scoring in Borussia Monchengladbach’s 4-1 win over Union Berlin on Sunday. ITALY: The coach of Atalanta says he acquired COVID-19 and was concerned for his life in mid-March. Gian Piero Gasperini told the Gazzetta dello Sport that he started feeling sick on March 9, a day before Atalanta played at Valencia in the second leg of the Champions League round of 16. He says that when he returned to Bergamo, which was quickly becoming the epicenter of the pandemic, “I didn’t have a fever but I felt destroyed and as if I had a 40-degree (Celsius, or 104 Fahrenheit) fever.” Gasperini said he quickly recovered without checking into the hospital and didn’t confirm he had the virus until the entire Atalanta team was tested 10 days ago. ENGLAND: The English Football League says the second-tier Championship is set to resume on June 20. The Premier League announced Thursday that play is due to return on June 17 following the coronavirus suspension that began mid-March. The EFL followed suit on Sunday evening, announcing that the Championship is set to restart around the same time, with hopes of finishing the season by the end of July. FOOTBALL The College Football Hall of Fame is boarded up and assessing damage from a destructive night of protests in downtown Atlanta. The facility’s most valuable trophies and artifacts were moved to a secure facility in case additional trouble breaks out amid nationwide unrest over the death in Minneapolis of George Floyd, a handcuffed black man who pleaded to police that he could not breathe. Kimberly Beaudin, the hall’s chief executive officer, said the extensive glass facade of the nearly 95,000-square-foot building was shattered Friday night. Rioters also broke into the street-level gift shop, stole merchandise and left it “pretty trashed,” she added. But, other than some broken glass that fell into a large exhibition area shaped like a football field, the interior of the hall was not breached by the protesters.

Police custody. The rage out there is predictable. It's understandable, and it's legitimate. Unfortunately, it's being expressed right now over the past week in ways that are destructive. Minnesota's governor, Tim Walz, praise those who kept their protests peaceful. The raw emotions were on display, and, as I said yesterday, the beautiful expression of solidarity in community that we saw played out by peaceful protestors demonstrations elsewhere Saturday also began peacefully, right. More than two dozen cities nationwide had nighttime curfews in place, and protesters came out anyway, in some cases descending into chaos and destruction. Mayor Kesha Let's bottoms have seen two straight nights of protests in Atlanta. Right now we're talking about cars being burned and businesses being vandalized, and there's still so many issues that are right before us that we've lost. Sign up. Georgia is one of more than a dozen states, plus the District of Columbia that have activated the National Guard to respond to undressed Advertisement Police officers across US shown kneeling in solidarity, hug protesters Share Shares Copy Link Copy In the midst of protests and destruction around the nation, moving scenes unfolded across the U.S. Sunday when some of the city's police officers knelt with protesters.Aleeia Abraham shot a video of the officers taking a knee during a march in Queens calling for justice for George Floyd, who died while being arrested in Minneapolis, and in protest of the senseless killings of other black people.In the video, the protesters are kneeling and you can hear the crowd's surprise when some of the officers take a knee as well.""I definitely didn't expect that,"" Abraham said. ""I've never seen that.""As they knelt, one protester reeled off the names of other black people who had died, including Trayvon Martin and Ahmaud Arbery.Even as cities around the country have been rocked for days by violent protests, similar heartening scenes emerged over the weekend. In Florida Saturday, several officers from various agencies knelt with protesters in prayer in front of Coral Gables City Hall.In Oklahoma, photos captured the powerful moment when sheriff's deputies at the Oklahoma County Jail took a knee in solidarity with the protesters. Some officers were also seen talking to and hugging the protesters.In Iowa, Des Moines law enforcement took a knee outside of the Des Moines Police Department with protesters in solidarity.Shortly before 9 p.m. Sunday, protesters asked authorities to kneel with them in solidarity of George Floyd's death. Authorities kneeled with protesters for two minutes. After the moment was done, protesters dispersed from the area for the time being.""We've talked about many times in this building and everybody, every man and woman in the Des Moines Police Department knows what happened up there was wrong,"" said Des Moines Police Chief Dana Wingert. ""That's not what this is about. We've had a lot of violence. We've had a lot of unrest. But, what we saw tonight was a peaceful protest."" In Michigan, Genesee County Sheriff Chris Swanson walked with protesters after they chanted ""walk with us!""""Let's go, let's go,"" Swanson said as he and the cheering crowd proceeded. ""Where do you want to walk? We'll walk all night.""The New York march was peaceful and included a couple hundred people, Abraham said.Abraham, who runs an organization called The BlaQue Resource Network in Queens, said she'd never seen police do that in all her years of activism, or even on television at other protests.""That's great, it's a good sign, but what we're really looking for is action,"" she said.""I'll be even more impressed when we're not stepped on and gunned down. That's the moment I'm looking for.""The NYPD's 103rd Precinct is near where the march was held in the Jamaica neighborhood of Queens, so police knew about it in advance and were there.A pastor invited the officers to come into the circle of protesters to kneel with them, which was greeted with cheers from the crowd.All of the officers didn't kneel, Abraham said.Abraham said it was very nice of those officers who did kneel, but it was only a start.""I really want to be clear that that's not enough. It's a nice start, but it's nowhere near enough,"" she said.",0.0
1621803847,2020-05-31 18:59:00,World alarmed by violence in U.S.,https://www.pressherald.com/2020/05/31/world-alarmed-by-violence-in-u-s/,en,False,,366984,pressherald.com,http://pressherald.com/,"LONDON — Nations around the world have watched in horror at the civil unrest in the United States following the death of George Floyd, a black man who died after a white police officer pressed his knee on his neck until he stopped breathing. Racism-tinged events no longer startle even America’s closest allies, though many have watched coverage of the often-violent protests with growing unease. Burning cars and riot police in the U.S. featured on newspaper front pages around the globe Sunday – bumping news of the COVID-19 pandemic to second-tier status in some places. Floyd’s death on May 25 in Minneapolis was the latest in a series of deaths of black men and women at the hands of police in the U.S. Thousands gathered in central London on Sunday to offer support for American demonstrators. Chanting “No justice! No peace!” and waving placards with the words “How many more?” at Trafalgar Square, the protesters ignored U.K. government rules banning crowds because of the pandemic. Police didn’t stop them. Demonstrators then marched to the U.S. Embassy, where a long line of officers surrounded the building. Several hundred milled around in the street and waved placards. Protesters in Denmark also converged on the U.S. Embassy on Sunday. Participants carried placards with messages such as “Stop Killing Black People.” The U.S. Embassy in Berlin was the scene of protests on Saturday under the motto: “Justice for George Floyd.” Several hundred more people took to the streets Sunday in the capital’s Kreuzberg area, carrying signs with slogans like “Silence is Violence,” “Hold Cops Accountable,” and “Who Do You Call When Police Murder?” No incidents were reported. Germany’s top-selling Bild newspaper on Sunday carried the sensational headline “This killer-cop set America ablaze” with an arrow pointing to a photo of now-fired police officer Derek Chauvin, who has been charged with third-degree murder in Floyd’s death, with his knee on Floyd’s neck. The newspaper’s story reported “scenes like out of a civil war.” In Italy, the Corriere della Sera newspaper’s senior U.S. correspondent Massimo Gaggi wrote that the reaction to Floyd’s killing was “different” than previous cases of black Americans killed by police and the ensuring violence. “There are exasperated black movements that no longer preach nonviolent resistance,” Gaggi wrote, noting the Minnesota governor’s warning that “anarchist and white supremacy groups are trying to fuel the chaos.” In countries with authoritarian governments, state-controlled media have been highlighting the chaos and violence of the U.S. demonstrations, in part to undermine American officials’ criticism of their own nations. In China, the protests are being viewed through the prism of U.S. government criticism of China’s crackdown on anti-government protests in Hong Kong. Hu Xijin, the editor of the state-owned Global Times newspaper, tweeted that U.S. officials can now see protests out their own windows: “I want to ask Speaker Pelosi and Secretary Pompeo: Should Beijing support protests in the U.S., like you glorified rioters in Hong Kong?” Hua Chunying, a Chinese Foreign ministry spokeswoman, pointed out America’s racial unrest by tweeting “I can’t breathe,” which Floyd said before his death. In Iran, which has violently put down nationwide demonstrations by killing hundreds, arresting thousands and disrupting internet access to the outside world, state television has repeatedly aired images of the U.S. unrest. One TV anchor discussed “a horrible scene from New York, where police attacked protesters.” Another state TV message accused U.S. police agencies in Washington of “setting fire to cars and attacking protesters,” without offering any evidence. Russia accused the United States of “systemic problems in the human rights sphere.” It denounced Floyd’s death as the latest in a series of police violence cases against African Americans. “This incident is far from the first in a series of lawless conduct and unjustified violence from U.S. law enforcement,’’ the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement. “American police commit such high-profile crimes all too often.’’ There also have been expressions of solidarity with the demonstrators. In Brazil, hundreds of people gathered in front of the Rio de Janeiro state government palace to protest crimes committed by the police against black people in Rio’s working-class neighborhoods, known as favelas. The protest, called “Black lives matter,” was interrupted when police used tear gas to disperse people. “I can’t breathe”, said some of the demonstrators, alluding to the George Floyd’s death. Protesters called for an end to police operations inside favelas. They shouted the names of some victims followed by the word “present!” Rio has one of the most deadly police in Brazil. In 2019 they killed 1,546 people, the highest number since 1998, and much of that was during police operations in favelas. Over the weekend, Lebanese anti-government protesters flooded social media with tweets sympathetic to U.S. protesters, using the hashtag #Americarevolts. That’s a play on the slogan for Lebanon’s protest movement – Lebanon revolts – which erupted on Oct. 17 last year. Within 24 hours, the hashtag #Americanrevolts became the No. 1 trending tag in Lebanon. In another expression of solidarity with American protesters, about 150 people marched through central Jerusalem on Saturday to protest the shooting death by Israeli police of an unarmed, autistic Palestinian man earlier in the day. Israeli police mistakenly suspected that the man, Iyad Halak, was carrying a weapon. When he failed to obey orders to stop, officers opened fire.

Early Sunday evening the protesters blocked several streets around the police station and in the Old Port, but they dispersed about 7:30 p.m. without having met with Clark. Organizers said they would return on Monday. Attempts to reach the police chief were unsuccessful Sunday night, and a spokesman said he didn’t know why Clark didn’t meet with the protesters. Police said that no arrests were made during Sunday’s demonstrations. The death of George Floyd has sparked protests across the country, and in Portland hundreds of demonstrators marched down Congress Street on Sunday, chanting, “No justice, no peace! No racist police!” After walking to the Cumberland County Jail earlier in the afternoon, protesters stopped at the intersection of Congress and St. John streets and held two minutes of silence for a man, Chance David Baker, who was shot dead by a Portland police officer in 2017 at Union Station Plaza. In the days after his death, Black Lives Matter activists rallied to protest the killing of Baker, who was biracial, a light-skinned man with pale blue eyes. The Maine Attorney General’s Office, which investigates all police-involved shootings in the state, later ruled that the shooting was justified. After the observance for Baker on Sunday, the protesters moved to the police station on Middle Street. “What we’re fighting for is justice. What we’re fighting for is peace,” said an organizer who declined to give his name. Police officers stood at the top of the steps leading to the police station, and Lt. Robert Doherty addressed the crowd, telling them the department shared the goal of keeping people safe. Still, he asked protesters to disperse for public safety during the coronavirus pandemic. “We want everyone in front of us to be safe and everyone behind us to be safe,” Doherty said. Protesters demanded that Chief Clark come out to speak. Doherty asked that they agree to disperse after Clark spoke. They refused, and fanned out to neighboring intersections, where they formed human chains and lay on the pavement to block traffic. Around 8 p.m. Sunday, after protestors had dispersed, about a dozen Portland officers, each wearing rubber gloves, came out of the Middle Street building and removed a pile of cardboard signs that had been stacked on the sidewalk next to the station. The officers walked past an underground garage door to the police station that had been defaced with graffiti chalk. The messages read, “There are no good cops, RIP George Floyd, Silence is Violence, and Trayvon Martin.” Martin was the 17-year-old African American teenager who was shot and killed in Florida in 2012 by George Zimmerman for allegedly acting suspiciously. The protest Sunday was one of several days’ demonstrations over Floyd’s death. On Friday, hundreds of people marched through downtown Portland in two protests that concluded peacefully, with officers blocking traffic and clearing paths for people to walk. Chief Clark on Friday called the conduct of the Minnesota police officer whose knee was on Floyd’s neck “unacceptable.” Clark, Officer Les Smith, president of the Police Benevolent Association, and Sgt. Eric Nevins, president of the Supervisory Officers’ Association, issued an open letter to the community on Friday. “As human beings and law enforcement professionals, we are saddened and deeply disturbed by the recent and tragic police-involved fatality in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and the negative impacts such incidents have not only upon the trust of our profession, but within our broader communities as well,” the statement reads. “Our hearts go out to George Floyd’s family and friends, and we, like many, are awaiting answers and justice.” The Minneapolis police officer, Derek Chauvin, kneeled on Floyd’s neck for several minutes, despite repeated pleas by Floyd that he couldn’t breathe. Chauvin was arrested Friday and charged with third-degree murder. “My first reaction was what if that was my brother or father or son?” Clark said in an interview Friday. “To say it was disturbing is probably an understatement.” But despite protesters’ calls to see the chief, he did not appear on Sunday. As Sunday evening wore on, groups of protesters blocked intersections all along Congress and Middle streets in the Old Port, from Franklin Street to Temple Street. At the intersection of Middle and Exchange streets, a man in a pickup truck revved his engine at protesters blocking his way, sending up a cloud of exhaust smoke. After a shouting match, he backed up along the one-way street to get away. A protester with his face covered by a bandanna zipped back and forth along Middle Street on a motorcycle, doing doughnuts and making screeching sounds with his tires. People chanted, “Black lives matter” and “This is what democracy looks like.” Related Hundreds take to Portland streets Friday to protest Minneapolis police killing Over and over, the protesters called on white Mainers to support people of color and fight for policing reform. “I’m sickened by the killing of George Floyd, and as a white person I wanted to show up,” Erin Brown of Portland said. “I don’t want it to be their problem. It’s all of our problem.” After more than an hour of blocking streets throughout the Old Port, protesters faced a decision about whether to stay and what to ask for. Leaders of the demonstration appeared to argue. “What are we doing? What are we even asking for? It’s all so nebulous,” one woman shouted at a male organizer while both were standing in the intersection of Middle and Market streets. He replied that they wanted a conversation with a police chief, and justice for Baker, the man who was shot in 2017. Nearby, two police officers stepped out of their parked cruiser to speak to protesters. “We put ourselves on the line for you. We would die for you,” Officer Darrel Gibson said to the group. “I don’t even know you and I would die for you.” “It’s just a uniform,” the officer next to him said. “We don’t trust the uniform,” a protester said. For a moment, the confrontation appeared ready to escalate. A chain of protesters with linked arms blocked the stairs leading to the police station. Each wrote a phone number on their arm – someone to bail them out if they were arrested, they said. At one point, a boy outside the police station picked up a rock. Other protesters noticed and shouted at him to put it down. No violence occurred that a reporter present could see. Protesters repeatedly emphasized that they were committed to nonviolence. Some protesters wrote chalk messages on the brick and concrete exterior of the station, which soon was practically covered. “Stop killing us,” one message said. Eventually protesters decided to disperse, but first gathered again outside the police station on Middle Street to regroup and discuss plans to come back. Speaking through a megaphone, Mary Tadsse, an organizer from Portland, recalled a confrontation with an unfriendly driver that evening who had tried to get through their cordon blocking the road. She likened the protesters’ solidarity in that moment to the unity she said communities need to stop racial bias in policing. “We came together and stayed there, and he backed up, and that’s why we’re here today,” she said. Other protesters took the megaphone to discuss future plans. They announced that another protest would take place on Monday, with the details to be decided and spread around town via social media. After several minutes chanting “I can’t breathe” and “Black Lives Matter,” and briefly, with middle fingers raised, “(Expletive) the police,” the crowd dispersed. In an interview afterward, Tadsse urged white people who didn’t make it to the protest to come out next time. “Come fight with us,” she said. “It’s not that hard to get out of your homes.” Tadsse said Clark’s absence showed police didn’t take their concerns seriously. Asked what protesters wanted from the police, she said that they wanted to know that authorities were listening to the community’s anger and concern about racial bias in policing. “Listen to us. Change,” she said. Staff Writer Dennis Hoey contributed to this report. Send questions/comments to the editors. « Previous Next » filed under:",0.0

She likened the protesters’ solidarity in that moment to the unity she said communities need to stop racial bias in policing. “We came together and stayed there, and he backed up, and that’s why we’re here today,” she said. Other protesters took the megaphone to discuss future plans. They announced that another protest would take place on Monday, with the details to be decided and spread around town via social media. After several minutes chanting “I can’t breathe” and “Black Lives Matter,” and briefly, with middle fingers raised, “(Expletive) the police,” the crowd dispersed. In an interview afterward, Tadsse urged white people who didn’t make it to the protest to come out next time. “Come fight with us,” she said. “It’s not that hard to get out of your homes.” Tadsse said Clark’s absence showed police didn’t take their concerns seriously. Asked what protesters wanted from the police, she said that they wanted to know that authorities were listening to the community’s anger and concern about racial bias in policing. “Listen to us. Change,” she said. Staff Writer Dennis Hoey contributed to this report. Send questions/comments to the editors. « Previous Next » filed under:",0.0

The move came Friday, hours after the U.S. Department of Justice said it filed court papers in support of campground operators. The campgrounds sued in federal court saying they believe the rule treats Maine residents more favorably than out-of-state residents, and that is hurting them economically. U.S. District Judge Lance Walker on Friday denied a motion for a preliminary injunction, allowing the rule to stand while the lawsuit proceeds, the Portland Press Herald reported. Gov. Janet Mills, a Democrat, said the quarantine is ""a proven tool to prevent the spread of this deadly disease"" and said the Justice Department is ""making a concerted effort to undermine the health of the people of Maine."" Mills said Saturday restaurants in Androscoggin, Cumberland and York counties that she told to delay opening can sell their excess food to prisons. Mills plans to start the second phase of the state's reopening on June 1 but said restaurants in those counties won't be able to open that day. She said the Maine Department of Corrections commissioner has agreed to purchase excess food from restaurants in those areas, WMTE reported. On Saturday, Maine reported four more deaths from COVID-19 for a total of 89. The state also reported 56 new coronavirus cases, raising its total to 2,282 New Hampshire The head of a group that represents New Hampshire nursing homes is begging the public to wear face coverings to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. Brendan Williams, president of the New Hampshire Health Care Association, says he supports Nashua's ordinance requiring face masks in public. ""Considerable sacrifice was demanded of Americans in winning World War II. Are we now unwilling to wear masks, or socially distance, to save those who lived through World War II?"" he said in a statement. Department of Health and Human Services Commissioner Lori Shibinette said May 6 that all nursing home residents would be tested within two weeks. On Friday, she said about 95% had been tested. Staff testing was expected to be completed over the weekend. New Hampshire on Saturday announced four additional COVID-19-related deaths. All were age 60 or older and all were in Hillsborough County. The state also announced 55 new positive test results for COVID-19, bringing the state’s total to 4,545. There were nine new hospitalized cases, keeping the state’s rate of hospitalization at 10%. Of the cases on Saturday with complete information, four were age 18 or younger. The new cases live in Hillsborough County other than Manchester and Nashua (10), Merrimack (7), Rockingham (7), Belknap (2), Carroll (1), Grafton (1), and Strafford (1) counties, and in Manchester (13) and Nashua (12). Through Saturday, the state has conducted 70,280 detection tests and 11,468 antibody tests. Massachusetts City officials in Boston are concerned many Asian American residents may not be getting tested for the new coronavirus. Boston's Chinatown zip code, where half the residents are of Asian descent, is one of city neighborhoods with the lowest percentage of positive coronavirus cases, Marty Martinez, the city's chief of Health and Human Services told the Boston Globe. Only 13% of those tested were positive, compared to the citywide cumulative percentage of 26%. Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders make up just less than 10% of Boston's population but account for only 4% of confirmed COVID-19 cases and 6% of deaths, according the newspaper. At the same time, black residents, who comprise 25% of the city's population, account for 38% of COVID-19 infections and 35% of deaths, in cases where the race and ethnicity is known. Latinos make up nearly 20% of the Boston population and account for 25% of cases and 11% of deaths. Paul Watanabe, a political science professor and director of the Institute for Asian American Studies at the University of Massachusetts Boston who is on the mayor's COVID-19 Health Inequities Task Force, thinks the numbers, though incomplete, show a low level of testing among Boston's Asian American population. The percentage of deaths may indicate those Asian Americans with COVID-19 are getting tested late. ""It suggests people might be contracting the illness, unknown that they got it, and going straight to death... without having their situation diagnosed through a positive test or being dealt with, more importantly,"" Watanabe said. Connecticut Health care workers rallied in New London Saturday to protest what they called a shortage of personal protective equipment and pay tribute to a nurse's aide who died earlier this month after contracting the coronavirus. Gov. Ned Lamont, Lt. Gov. Susan Bysiewicz and U.S. Rep. Joe Courtney, D-Conn., joined workers at Lawrence + Memorial Hospital and the Visiting Nurses Association of Southeastern Connecticut for the rally. Union leaders said nurses, aides and other health care workers are risking their lives caring for COVID-19 patients while lacking sufficient protective gear to keep them safe. People at the rally remembered Elva Graveline, a 52-year-old nurse's aide at Lawrence + Memorial who contracted the coronavirus and died May 19. Graveline's daughter thanked hospital workers for caring for her mother, according to the AFT Connecticut labor union. As of Friday, nearly 41,800 people in Connecticut tested positive for the virus and nearly 3,900 have died, including about 2,400 nursing home residents.",0.0
1621814293,2020-05-31 12:35:59,"1,000 rally in Manchester for Black Lives Matter march",https://www.seacoastonline.com/news/20200530/1000-rally-in-manchester-for-black-lives-matter-march?rssfeed=true,en,False,,658823,State News - United States - Maine,http://www.maine.statenews.net/,"MANCHESTER — More than 1,000 people took to the streets Saturday morning as part of a peaceful protest against the killings of unarmed black men around the country. “We plan to stand in solidarity with the people who are assassinated in our country,” said Tyrell Whitted, a Manchester resident and one of the march organizers with Black Lives Matter. The nation is being rocked by the May 25 death of George Floyd in Minneapolis seemingly at the hands of police, and the resulting protests – and in some cases riots. Four Minneapolis police officers involved in the arrest have been fired. One of them, Derek Chauvin was arrested and charged Friday with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter in Floyd’s death. “I believe that when justice isn’t served the people are going to react,” Whitted said. People started gathering at Veteran’s Memorial Park Saturday morning ahead of the march, ready with signs, and the ever-present face masks to help curb the spread of COVID-19. By and large, the marchers want to see change following the death of Floyd and others, including another recent victim, Ahmaud Arbery. In February, Arbery, an African-American, was chased down by two white men, a father and son, and shot to death. The killing took place in February, but no arrests were made until after a video of the incident leaked to the press months later. “I’m so outraged I can’t even articulate my anger,” said Carla Giorgi or Manchester. Giorgi, a white woman raising an African American son, said she fears for her child’s life as he grows up in America, given the violence African Americans are subject to. Giorgi’s friend, Helena Laquinta, of Nashua, said white people have a responsibility to minorities to end the racial injustices that are killing them. “We built this systemic racism, so we have to be the ones who change it,” Laquinta said. India Barrows, a Manchester resident and an African American, said the country needs to stop harming minorities. The violence and discrimination minorities face from civil authorities in New Hampshire is a long-standing problem, she said. “This has been happening since I was 18,” Barrows said. James McKim, president of the Manchester chapter of the NAACP, attended the march to support the Black Lives Matter movement. “We have to talk about the scourge of racism and discrimination in this country,” McKim said. McKim said that while race relations in New Hampshire are good overall, racism is real and it does lasting harm. He’s currently dealing with officials involved in Albany where two New Hampshire State Troopers were caught on video smashing into the car of Jean Saint Preux, an African American, and pulling him out of his vehicle by his dreadlocks. McKim said he’s spoken with police and FBI agents about that case. McKim said the problem stems from people not seeing the full human dignity in other people, and then treating them as less than human. “Many people don’t see others as individuals,” McKim said. Minneapolis Police Officer Derek Chauvin was captured on video with his knee on Floyd’s neck during an arrest as Floyd can be heard begging for air. Floyd later died and it took authorities in Minneapolis days to arrest Chauvin and charge him with third-degree murder. Saturday’s march had protesters headed down Elm Street past City Hall chanting “No Justice, No Peace,” “Black Lives Matter,” and “Hands Up, Don’t Shoot,” among other refrains. The march and rally afterward were peaceful, with Manchester police providing traffic control to clear the road for marchers. Gov. Chris Sununu issued the following statement following the rally: “This morning I called the organizers ahead of the George Floyd March in Manchester to let them know the State of New Hampshire stands with them in their calls for justice,” said Gov. Chris Sununu. “This important conversation must continue and we must constructively work together as a nation to ensure there is change.” Manchester Police Chief Carl Capano is seen on the video engaging with the protesters and talking about Floyd’s death. “[What happened to George Floyd] disgusts me and every police officer standing behind me,” Capano said. “Nobody hates a bad cop more than a good cop.”",0.0

The driver of the truck, Scott Kimball, 43, and passenger, his son, Mark Kimball, 19, were arrested and charged with felony riot and felony criminal threatening, according to police. As of 5 p.m., there was still ""activity"" outside the police station, said Lt. Shawn McCabe, and the building remained closed to visitors for the ""safety of officers and employees."" Police declined to say where the two men were from. Stacy Harrison, a photographer on assignment for Manchester Ink Link, was at the scene when it unfolded. She said a small group of protesters gathered at the police station at 405 Valley St. after the Elm Street demonstration. It was an effort to initiate a dialog with law enforcement, according to organizers of the earlier march, which drew an estimated 1,000 people. The march itself was peaceful and organizers even had two people offering participants free face masks (cognizant of social distancing in the age of COVID-19) in baskets at the end of ski poles. At the police station, however, things turned ugly when a young man saw a black pickup truck with a huge Trump flag in its bed heading up Valley Street, from Elm Street, and nearing the police station. Harrison said the protester, who she described as a black man in his late teens or early 20s, started swearing. She turned to see what he was looking at and saw the truck. The driver and passenger were both white males. ""Every nasty possible thing you can think he was swearing at the truck,"" she said. Harrison said as the truck crawled by her and her 15-year-old daughter, the occupants of the truck – a driver and passenger – began hurling insults at the young man. The young man responded with his own diatribe. She thought those in the truck were going to yell whatever they were going to yell and then keep going but then the young man went toward the truck and a heated exchange took place. ""They were yelling the ""N"" word,"" she said. ""They were screaming at each other and I heard the word ""Trump"" a few times."" By then other people saw what was happening and headed toward the truck as well. ""They all sort of swarmed like a bunch of bees towards the truck,"" she said. The driver pulled the truck over into the parking lot outside Associated Concrete Coatings and the yelling continued. Someone threw something that was white – Harrison thought it might be a piece of paper, a bottle cap or a water bottle – which bounced off the driver’s window. Then she saw something black being waved around by someone in the truck and heard shouts of, ""He’s got a gun. He’s got a gun."" Officers immediately surrounded the truck. Initially, she said there were 20 to 25 officers but more streamed out of the station. She estimated there were about 60 officers in the street by the time two men were taken into custody. Melissa Bernardin, a longtime resident of Concord, was also at police headquarters when the violence erupted. She had come to Manchester Saturday morning to support the cause, and was part of the group that moved from Elm Street to police headquarters. ""By the time I arrived the situation had gone from tense to a positive dialogue with police,"" Bernardin said. At some point she said she noticed a pick-up truck drive slowly by the police station displaying a large Trump flag. Several minutes later she saw the same truck coming back from the other direction. She regarded the people in the truck as instigators. ""Some of the protesters who also saw the truck started yelling at the truck. I recall seeing a protester throw a water bottle at the truck. At that point I started running toward the truck to try and deescalate the situation because I know it wasn’t going to turn into anything good,"" Bernardin said. ""I saw the driver of the truck jump out with a gun at which point I ran away to seek shelter behind a concrete lamp post, but I heard the driver cocked and pointed the gun at the crowd. And then I heard that the passenger got out and drew his gun out of his holster but that he didn’t point it at anyone."" Although Manchester is far removed from Minneapolis, she suspects people came out in solidarity with the Black Life Matters movement here for the same reason she did. ""The issue of racism and police brutality in our country is one that touches all communities, and while there may be different levels of racism and police brutality against people of color in different communities, we all feel every human deserves to be treated with dignity,"" Bernardin says. ""We feel solidarity with individuals who are killed at the hands of police."" She says she considers herself a white ally of the Black Lives Matter movement. ""I’ve personally come to an understanding of how prevalent racism and violence against people of color is in our society through reading and learning and following the news, and the more you follow it the more heartbreaking it is,"" Bernardin said. ""I can’t see any way not to join a protest in solidarity with those being directly affected by police brutality."" She said she’s thankful the day’s events were mostly peaceful. ""I’m thankful the men who jumped out of the truck with guns didn’t kill anyone. It’s terrifying to me that a group of people who show up in public to demonstrate because they care about the intrinsic value of human life could have to face down such a terrifying threat."" In a news release, police agreed that the Black Lives Matter demonstration earlier in the day was peaceful and those in attendance were respectful of each other and police. No one was arrested. After the march, 100 people gathered outside the station when about 1:30 p.m. the confrontation occurred Police confirmed one of the truck’s occupants pulled out a gun – they did not say whether it was the passenger or driver – but both were taken into custody. They were being booked Saturday afternoon. Police said their identities will be released later. People remained outside the station after the arrests were made. Police Chief Carlo Capano and Assistant Chief Ryan Grant talked with protesters following the arrests. In one video recording, posted online by Matthew Lawrence, Capano is heard talking about what happened to George Floyd, the Minneapolis man who died after Officer Derek Chauvin held his foot on Floyd’s neck for nine minutes. Chauvin is charged with third-degree murder. ""[What happened to George Floyd] disgusts me and every police officer standing behind me,"" Capano said. ""Nobody hates a bad cop more than a good cop."" As of 2:30 p.m., some people were still outside the police station. Police said while the department is open, the building is closed ""for the safety of our officers and employees,"" according to the news release issued by Public Information Officer Heather Hamel.

""This can be kind of a tinderbox for COVID,"" the 39-year-old venture capitalist said after attending a demonstration in Florida, one of many around the country sparked by the death of George Floyd, a black man who died after he was pinned at the neck by a white Minneapolis police officer. As more beaches, churches, mosques, schools and businesses reopened worldwide, the sudden and mass civil unrest in the United States is raising fears of new virus outbreaks in a country that has more confirmed infections and deaths than any other. And it's not just in the U.S. — London hosted a large anti-racism protest Sunday where demonstrators violated social distancing rules. Rosa Jimenez Cano said she planned to self-quarantine for 14 days, worrying she was perhaps ""irresponsible"" when she attended Saturday night's protest in Miami, where she exposed herself to crowds of people. Protests over Floyd's death — the latest in a series of killings of black men and women at the hands of police in America — have shaken the country from Minneapolis to New York, from Atlanta to Los Angeles. Some turned into riots and clashes with police, leaving stores in flames and torched cars in the streets. Health experts fear that silent carriers of the virus could unwittingly infect others at protests where people are packed cheek to jowl, many without masks, many chanting, singing or shouting. The virus is dispersed by microscopic droplets in the air when people cough, sneeze, sing or talk. ""There's no question that, when you put hundreds or thousands of people together in close proximity, when we have got this virus all over the streets ... it's not healthy,"" Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan said Sunday on CNN's ""State of the Union."" ""Two weeks from now across America, we're going to find out whether or not this gives us a spike and drives the numbers back up again or not."" The U.S. has seen over 1.7 million infections and nearly 104,000 deaths in the pandemic, which has disproportionately affected racial minorities in a nation that does not have universal health care. Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser said Sunday she was very concerned that the protests in the nation's capital and elsewhere could provide fertile ground for a new series of outbreaks. Many of the protesters were wearing masks, but there were no attempts at social distancing. ""We've been working very hard in these last eight to 10 weeks to not have any mass gatherings,"" she said. ""As a nation, we have to be concerned about a rebound."" Even the many protesters wearing masks are not guaranteed protection. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says cloth masks keep infected people from spreading the virus but are not designed to protect wearers from getting it. Mass protests in connection with Floyd's death were also being held in Europe. In London, thousands of people marched Sunday chanting ""No justice! No peace!"" while carrying signs reading ""Justice for George Floyd"" and ""Racism is a global issue."" Many demonstrators were not wearing masks and most in the crowd at Trafalgar Square were packed closely together. Britain has seen nearly 38,500 virus deaths, the second-highest in the world after the United States. In Berlin, hundreds of protesters picketed outside the U.S. Embassy on Saturday night under the motto: ""Justice for George Floyd."" Others marched near the U.S. embassy in Copenhagen, Denmark. Many Americans returned Sunday to in-person church services for the first time in weeks and tens of thousands of mosques reopened across the Middle East, but countries from India to Colombia still saw rising numbers of new infections. Nearly 6.1 million infections have been reported worldwide, with nearly 370,000 people dying, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. The true death toll is believed to be significantly higher, since many victims died of the virus without ever being tested. The situation worsened Sunday in India, where new daily cases topped 8,000 for the first time and 193 more deaths were reported. Despite that, India still is easing restrictions on shops and public transport in more states beginning Monday, although subways and schools will remain closed. In Saudi Arabia, mosques reopened Sunday for the first time in more than two months, but Islam's holiest site in Mecca remained closed. In Jerusalem, throngs of worshippers waited outside the Al-Aqsa Mosque before it reopened. Many wore surgical masks and waited for temperature checks as they entered. In Bogota, the capital of Colombia, authorities were locking down an area of nearly 1.5 million people as cases continued to rise. Mayor Claudia Lopez said no one in the working-class Kennedy area — inaugurated by the late U.S. President John F. Kennedy in 1961 — will be allowed out, except to seek food or medical care or in case of an emergency. Factories must also close. In Spain, Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez said Sunday that he would ask Parliament for a final two-week extension of the nation's state of emergency that is set to expire on June 7. That allows the government to keep ordering lockdown measures to control its coronavirus outbreak, which has claimed at least 27,000 lives, many of them in overwhelmed nursing homes. ""We have almost reached safe harbor,"" Sánchez said. At the Vatican, Pope Francis cautioned people against being pessimistic as they emerge from coronavirus lockdowns. During Mass in St. Peter's Basilica to mark Pentecost Sunday, Francis noted a tendency to say that ""nothing will return as before."" That kind of thinking, Francis said, guarantees that ""the one thing that certainly does not return is hope.""",0.0

Early Sunday evening the protesters blocked several streets around the police station and in the Old Port, but they dispersed about 7:30 p.m. without having met with Clark. Organizers said they would return on Monday. Attempts to reach the police chief were unsuccessful Sunday night, and a spokesman said he didn’t know why Clark didn’t meet with the protesters. Police said that no arrests were made during Sunday’s demonstrations. The death of George Floyd has sparked protests across the country, and in Portland hundreds of demonstrators marched down Congress Street on Sunday, chanting, “No justice, no peace! No racist police!” After walking to the Cumberland County Jail earlier in the afternoon, protesters stopped at the intersection of Congress and St. John streets and held two minutes of silence for a man, Chance David Baker, who was shot dead by a Portland police officer in 2017 at Union Station Plaza. In the days after his death, Black Lives Matter activists rallied to protest the killing of Baker, who was biracial, a light-skinned man with pale blue eyes. The Maine Attorney General’s Office, which investigates all police-involved shootings in the state, later ruled that the shooting was justified. After the observance for Baker on Sunday, the protesters moved to the police station on Middle Street. “What we’re fighting for is justice. What we’re fighting for is peace,” said an organizer who declined to give his name. Police officers stood at the top of the steps leading to the police station, and Lt. Robert Doherty addressed the crowd, telling them the department shared the goal of keeping people safe. Still, he asked protesters to disperse for public safety during the coronavirus pandemic. “We want everyone in front of us to be safe and everyone behind us to be safe,” Doherty said. Protesters demanded that Chief Clark come out to speak. Doherty asked that they agree to disperse after Clark spoke. They refused, and fanned out to neighboring intersections, where they formed human chains and lay on the pavement to block traffic. Around 8 p.m. Sunday, after protestors had dispersed, about a dozen Portland officers, each wearing rubber gloves, came out of the Middle Street building and removed a pile of cardboard signs that had been stacked on the sidewalk next to the station. The officers walked past an underground garage door to the police station that had been defaced with graffiti chalk. The messages read, “There are no good cops, RIP George Floyd, Silence is Violence, and Trayvon Martin.” Martin was the 17-year-old African American teenager who was shot and killed in Florida in 2012 by George Zimmerman for allegedly acting suspiciously. The protest Sunday was one of several days’ demonstrations over Floyd’s death. On Friday, hundreds of people marched through downtown Portland in two protests that concluded peacefully, with officers blocking traffic and clearing paths for people to walk. Chief Clark on Friday called the conduct of the Minnesota police officer whose knee was on Floyd’s neck “unacceptable.” Clark, Officer Les Smith, president of the Police Benevolent Association, and Sgt. Eric Nevins, president of the Supervisory Officers’ Association, issued an open letter to the community on Friday. “As human beings and law enforcement professionals, we are saddened and deeply disturbed by the recent and tragic police-involved fatality in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and the negative impacts such incidents have not only upon the trust of our profession, but within our broader communities as well,” the statement reads. “Our hearts go out to George Floyd’s family and friends, and we, like many, are awaiting answers and justice.” The Minneapolis police officer, Derek Chauvin, kneeled on Floyd’s neck for several minutes, despite repeated pleas by Floyd that he couldn’t breathe. Chauvin was arrested Friday and charged with third-degree murder. “My first reaction was what if that was my brother or father or son?” Clark said in an interview Friday. “To say it was disturbing is probably an understatement.” But despite protesters’ calls to see the chief, he did not appear on Sunday. As Sunday evening wore on, groups of protesters blocked intersections all along Congress and Middle streets in the Old Port, from Franklin Street to Temple Street. At the intersection of Middle and Exchange streets, a man in a pickup truck revved his engine at protesters blocking his way, sending up a cloud of exhaust smoke. After a shouting match, he backed up along the one-way street to get away. A protester with his face covered by a bandanna zipped back and forth along Middle Street on a motorcycle, doing doughnuts and making screeching sounds with his tires. People chanted, “Black lives matter” and “This is what democracy looks like.” Related Hundreds take to Portland streets Friday to protest Minneapolis police killing Over and over, the protesters called on white Mainers to support people of color and fight for policing reform. “I’m sickened by the killing of George Floyd, and as a white person I wanted to show up,” Erin Brown of Portland said. “I don’t want it to be their problem. It’s all of our problem.” After more than an hour of blocking streets throughout the Old Port, protesters faced a decision about whether to stay and what to ask for. Leaders of the demonstration appeared to argue. “What are we doing? What are we even asking for? It’s all so nebulous,” one woman shouted at a male organizer while both were standing in the intersection of Middle and Market streets. He replied that they wanted a conversation with a police chief, and justice for Baker, the man who was shot in 2017. Nearby, two police officers stepped out of their parked cruiser to speak to protesters. “We put ourselves on the line for you. We would die for you,” Officer Darrel Gibson said to the group. “I don’t even know you and I would die for you.” “It’s just a uniform,” the officer next to him said. “We don’t trust the uniform,” a protester said. For a moment, the confrontation appeared ready to escalate. A chain of protesters with linked arms blocked the stairs leading to the police station. Each wrote a phone number on their arm – someone to bail them out if they were arrested, they said. At one point, a boy outside the police station picked up a rock. Other protesters noticed and shouted at him to put it down. No violence occurred that a reporter present could see. Protesters repeatedly emphasized that they were committed to nonviolence. Some protesters wrote chalk messages on the brick and concrete exterior of the station, which soon was practically covered. “Stop killing us,” one message said. Eventually protesters decided to disperse, but first gathered again outside the police station on Middle Street to regroup and discuss plans to come back. Speaking through a megaphone, Mary Tadsse, an organizer from Portland, recalled a confrontation with an unfriendly driver that evening who had tried to get through their cordon blocking the road. She likened the protesters’ solidarity in that moment to the unity she said communities need to stop racial bias in policing. “We came together and stayed there, and he backed up, and that’s why we’re here today,” she said. Other protesters took the megaphone to discuss future plans. They announced that another protest would take place on Monday, with the details to be decided and spread around town via social media. After several minutes chanting “I can’t breathe” and “Black Lives Matter,” and briefly, with middle fingers raised, “(Expletive) the police,” the crowd dispersed. In an interview afterward, Tadsse urged white people who didn’t make it to the protest to come out next time. “Come fight with us,” she said. “It’s not that hard to get out of your homes.” Tadsse said Clark’s absence showed police didn’t take their concerns seriously. Asked what protesters wanted from the police, she said that they wanted to know that authorities were listening to the community’s anger and concern about racial bias in policing. “Listen to us. Change,” she said. Staff Writer Dennis Hoey contributed to this report. « Previous Next » filed under:",0.0

Asked if was giving up his title, he tweeted “Yes.” When one of Jones’ 2.3 million Twitter followers suggested he was hurting himself more than the UFC, Jones replied: “I hurt myself every time I walk out there and take a punch to the head and not feel my pay is worth it anymore.” Jones, 32, had been eyeing a fight with heavyweight Francis Ngannou, but said the UFC did not want to pay him enough. UFC President Dana White said the fighter wanted “crazy” money, citing demands of $15 million, $20 million and $30 million. “He can do whatever he wants to do. He can sit out, he can fight, he can whatever,” White said Saturday night after an event in Las Vegas. “Jon Jones can say whatever he wants publicly. It’s his God-given right here in America. He can say whatever he wants. And when he’s ready to come back and fight, he can.” SOCCER MLS: The Major League Soccer Players Association voted to approve economic concessions for this season, including across-the-board salary cuts, while also agreeing to play in a proposed summer tournament in Orlando, Florida. The proposal, made public by the union Sunday night, will now be sent to back to the league for approval by team owners. GERMANY: Four young players in the Bundesliga addressed the death of George Floyd in the United States during this weekend’s games. England’s 20-year-old winger Jadon Sancho and 21-year-old Morocco right-back Achraf Hakimi showed T-shirts with the handwritten message “Justice for George Floyd” after scoring goals in Borussia Dortmund’s 6-1 win Sunday at Paderborn, following the example set by Schalke’s American midfielder Weston McKennie, 21, who wore an armband with the same message on Saturday. Marcus Thuram, a 22-year-old Frenchman, took a knee after scoring in Borussia Monchengladbach’s 4-1 win over Union Berlin on Sunday. ITALY: The coach of Atalanta says he acquired COVID-19 and was concerned for his life in mid-March. Gian Piero Gasperini told the Gazzetta dello Sport that he started feeling sick on March 9, a day before Atalanta played at Valencia in the second leg of the Champions League round of 16. He says that when he returned to Bergamo, which was quickly becoming the epicenter of the pandemic, “I didn’t have a fever but I felt destroyed and as if I had a 40-degree (Celsius, or 104 Fahrenheit) fever.” Gasperini said he quickly recovered without checking into the hospital and didn’t confirm he had the virus until the entire Atalanta team was tested 10 days ago. ENGLAND: The English Football League says the second-tier Championship is set to resume on June 20. The Premier League announced Thursday that play is due to return on June 17 following the coronavirus suspension that began mid-March. The EFL followed suit on Sunday evening, announcing that the Championship is set to restart around the same time, with hopes of finishing the season by the end of July. FOOTBALL The College Football Hall of Fame is boarded up and assessing damage from a destructive night of protests in downtown Atlanta. The facility’s most valuable trophies and artifacts were moved to a secure facility in case additional trouble breaks out amid nationwide unrest over the death in Minneapolis of George Floyd, a handcuffed black man who pleaded to police that he could not breathe. Kimberly Beaudin, the hall’s chief executive officer, said the extensive glass facade of the nearly 95,000-square-foot building was shattered Friday night. Rioters also broke into the street-level gift shop, stole merchandise and left it “pretty trashed,” she added. But, other than some broken glass that fell into a large exhibition area shaped like a football field, the interior of the hall was not breached by the protesters. « Previous Next »",0.0

The crowd marched from Festival Plaza in Auburn and across the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Bridge. It included a brief stop at the Lewiston Police Station before concluding at the Auburn Police Station on Court Street. The protest added the Twin Cities to the long list of cities of all sizes around the country where people are standing up against police brutality. The local protest was largely peaceful, with demonstrators chanting, “I can’t breathe” and “No justice, no peace.” The only incident occurred when a group of protesters blocked a truck flying a “Trump 2020” flag and ripped it from the truck. The two trucks, which were adorned with Confederate flags, followed the procession as it marched, with the trucks’ drivers honking their horns and revving their engines. One participant said Sunday’s protest was a way to give a voice to an important movement. “We’re tired of keeping our mouths closed. We’re tired of the injustice. We want voices to be heard,” the protester said. “It needs to be known. We’re not taking it anymore. We’re not going anywhere. So you’re going to deal with us, period. We all bleed the same.” Kelsey Turner of Auburn said she planned the protest out of outrage. She said she made a Facebook event, shared it and the attendance list snowballed. “I had no idea what I was doing,” Turner said. “I didn’t think anyone would come.” Another protester, who only wanted to be identified as Mercy, said protesting helped bring awareness to an issue that has long been a problem in the United States. “This has been an issue for so long — black people being murdered,” Mercy said. “It’s definitely important to show that people are out there.” Related Headlines Protesters block traffic, demand to meet with Portland police chief « Previous Next » filed under:",0.0

Marcus Smart attended a protest Sunday night in Boston, as did Vincent Poirier, according to NBC Sports Boston’s A. Sherrod Blakely. Smart sported a “despite color or gender” hoodie and stopped to tell Blakely why he was there. “It’s not right,” Smart said. “So we’re going to have to come out here and have our voice be heard because we stand for the truth. We stand for justice. And we won’t stop until we get justice. “And that’s really what this is about. And I just want to say to every one that thinks this is something more than it is: It’s not. Despite color or gender, the truth is the truth. Justice is justice. “And justice hasn’t been served and people are pissed off about it. So we’re here to keep George Floyd’s name alive and keep it going in his legacy. Something has to change, and we’re here trying to make a change.” Though Floyd was handcuffed, Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin knelt on his neck for an extended period of time until the 46-year-old man became unresponsive. Video of the incident surfaced with Floyd repeatedly telling Chauvin he couldn’t breathe and calling out for his deceased mother. Protests have continued across the country. On Saturday night, Brown drove 15 hours to Atlanta to lead a peaceful protest of his own. He posted an Instagram video encouraging others to follow his lead. “Being a bystander is no longer acceptable,” Brown wrote. “If you and your friends are around or are witnesses to cultural biases, micro-aggressions, subtle acts of racism, actual racism etc. and you don’t speak up on it or do something about it, you are part of the problem. We’re past the point where if it’s not in your governance space so you have nothing to do with it. If you don’t speak up on these issues, you just as bad.” In Massachusetts, the protestors have Governor Charlie Baker’s blessing. “If people choose to protest, we need to make sure they have the ability to do that,” Baker said Friday. “We hope people protest peacefully but honestly, a moment like that, an event like that, I can’t imagine why people wouldn’t want to get out on the streets and make a point about it.” Send questions/comments to the editors. « Previous Next »",0.0

Police custody. The rage out there is predictable. It's understandable, and it's legitimate. Unfortunately, it's being expressed right now over the past week in ways that are destructive. Minnesota's governor, Tim Walz, praise those who kept their protests peaceful. The raw emotions were on display, and, as I said yesterday, the beautiful expression of solidarity in community that we saw played out by peaceful protestors demonstrations elsewhere Saturday also began peacefully, right. More than two dozen cities nationwide had nighttime curfews in place, and protesters came out anyway, in some cases descending into chaos and destruction. Mayor Kesha Let's bottoms have seen two straight nights of protests in Atlanta. Right now we're talking about cars being burned and businesses being vandalized, and there's still so many issues that are right before us that we've lost. Sign up. Georgia is one of more than a dozen states, plus the District of Columbia that have activated the National Guard to respond to undressed Advertisement President Trump briefly taken to underground bunker during Friday's White House protests Share Shares Copy Link Copy As protesters gathered outside the White House Friday night in Washington, D.C., President Donald Trump was briefly taken to the underground bunker for a period of time, according to a White House official.The president was there for a little under an hour before being brought upstairs. It's unclear if First Lady Melania Trump and Barron Trump were also taken down with him.Trump has repeatedly praised the Secret Service for its handling of the protests outside the White House Friday night in the wake of George Floyd's death last week in Minneapolis.The New York Times first reported Trump was taken to the bunker.The decision to physically move the president came as protesters confronted Secret Service officers outside the White House for hours on Friday — shouting, throwing water bottles and other objects at the line of officers, and attempting to break through the metal barriers.At times, the crowd would remove the metal barriers and begin pushing up against the officers and their riot shields. The Secret Service continually replaced the barriers throughout the night as protesters wrestled them away.Protesters pushed hard enough a few times that officers had to walk away with what appeared to be minor injuries. At one point, the agents responded to aggressive pushing and yelling by using pepper spray on the protesters.Throughout the night, protesters could be heard chanting their support for Floyd, an unarmed black man who died last week after being pinned down by a white police officer, and their dislike of Trump. The protest, which began around 10 p.m. ET, Friday night outside the White House, had mostly quieted down by 3:30 a.m. ET, Saturday morning.The crowd thinned out and Secret Service officers were able to expand their perimeter and barriers around Lafayette Park across from the White House.Six arrests were made during the protests, the Secret Service confirmed in a statement Saturday afternoon.The president on Thursday had used the threat of police retaliation and military intervention in Minnesota where protests turned violent and destructive — saying on Twitter that ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts.""Trump's tweets on Saturday also invoked imagery tied to brutal civil rights-era police tactics.Now, a serious divide has emerged among the President's top allies and advisers over how the president should address several nights of protests and riots.Trump is being urged by some advisers to formally address the nation and call for calm, while others have said he should condemn the rioting and looting more forcefully or risk losing middle-of-the-road voters in November, according to several sources familiar with the deliberations.",0.0

Target said it has closed six stores for an extended period. It hopes to reopen its Lake Street store in Minneapolis by the end of this year. The store was near the place where Floyd was killed and it was heavily damaged during last week’s protests. Another store in Minneapolis remains closed, along with stores in Oakland, California; Atlanta; Philadelphia and Chicago. Target said it temporarily closed or adjusted hours at more than 200 stores over the weekend, but most were scheduled to reopen Sunday or Monday. CVS didn’t say how many stores it closed, but it said the shuttered locations are in more than 20 states and the District of Columbia. A spokeswoman for the company said pharmacies at closed stores will reroute customers to a nearby CVS so they can get prescriptions filled. “Employee and customer safety is our top priority, so we are continually monitoring protests as they occur in the communities we serve and will close stores, if needed, to help ensure the safety of employees and customers,” CVS said in a statement. Floyd, who was black and handcuffed, died while being arrested by Minneapolis police for suspicion of passing a counterfeit bill on May 25. Cellphone video showed that a white officer, Derek Chauvin, pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck for several minutes while Floyd pleaded for air and eventually stopped moving. Chauvin now faces murder and manslaughter charges. The other three officers who took part in the arrest were fired but haven’t been charged. “We are heartbroken by the death of George Floyd and the pain it is causing communities across the country,” Target said in a statement. “Our focus will remain on our team members’ safety and helping our community heal.” Target said employees at stores that are closed will be paid for up to 14 days, including premiums they are earning due to the pandemic. They will also be able to work at Target locations that remain open. Send questions/comments to the editors. « Previous Next »",0.0

As more beaches, churches, mosques, schools and businesses reopened worldwide, the sudden and mass civil unrest in the United States is raising fears of new virus outbreaks in a country that has more confirmed infections and deaths than any other. And it’s not just in the U.S. – London hosted a large anti-racism protest Sunday where demonstrators violated social distancing rules. Rosa Jimenez Cano said she planned to self-quarantine for 14 days, worrying she was perhaps “irresponsible” when she attended Saturday night’s protest in Miami, where she exposed herself to crowds of people. Protests over Floyd’s death – the latest in a series of killings of black men and women at the hands of police in America – have shaken the country from Minneapolis to New York, from Atlanta to Los Angeles. Some turned into riots and clashes with police, leaving stores in flames and torched cars in the streets. Health experts fear that silent carriers of the virus could unwittingly infect others at protests where people are packed cheek to jowl, many without masks, many chanting, singing or shouting. The virus is dispersed by microscopic droplets in the air when people cough, sneeze, sing or talk. “There’s no question that, when you put hundreds or thousands of people together in close proximity, when we have got this virus all over the streets … it’s not healthy,” Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan said Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union.” “Two weeks from now across America, we’re going to find out whether or not this gives us a spike and drives the numbers back up again or not.” The U.S. has seen over 1.7 million infections and nearly 104,000 deaths in the pandemic, which has disproportionately affected racial minorities in a nation that does not have universal health care. Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser said Sunday she was very concerned that the protests in the nation’s capital and elsewhere could provide fertile ground for a new series of outbreaks. Many of the protesters were wearing masks, but there were no attempts at social distancing. “We’ve been working very hard in these last eight to 10 weeks to not have any mass gatherings,” she said. “As a nation, we have to be concerned about a rebound.” Even the many protesters wearing masks are not guaranteed protection. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says cloth masks keep infected people from spreading the virus but are not designed to protect wearers from getting it. Mass protests in connection with Floyd’s death were also being held in Europe. In London, thousands of people marched Sunday chanting “No justice! No peace!” while carrying signs reading “Justice for George Floyd” and “Racism is a global issue.” Many demonstrators were not wearing masks and most in the crowd at Trafalgar Square were packed closely together. Britain has seen nearly 38,500 virus deaths, the second-highest in the world after the United States. In Berlin, hundreds of protesters picketed outside the U.S. Embassy on Saturday night under the motto: “Justice for George Floyd.” Others marched near the U.S. embassy in Copenhagen, Denmark. Many Americans returned Sunday to in-person church services for the first time in weeks and tens of thousands of mosques reopened across the Middle East, but countries from India to Colombia still saw rising numbers of new infections. Nearly 6.1 million infections have been reported worldwide, with nearly 370,000 people dying, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. The true death toll is believed to be significantly higher, since many victims died of the virus without ever being tested. The situation worsened Sunday in India, where new daily cases topped 8,000 for the first time and 193 more deaths were reported. Despite that, India still is easing restrictions on shops and public transport in more states beginning Monday, although subways and schools will remain closed. In Saudi Arabia, mosques reopened Sunday for the first time in more than two months, but Islam’s holiest site in Mecca remained closed. In Jerusalem, throngs of worshippers waited outside the Al-Aqsa Mosque before it reopened. Many wore surgical masks and waited for temperature checks as they entered. In Bogota, the capital of Colombia, authorities were locking down an area of nearly 1.5 million people as cases continued to rise. Mayor Claudia Lopez said no one in the working-class Kennedy area – inaugurated by the late U.S. President John F. Kennedy in 1961 – will be allowed out, except to seek food or medical care or in case of an emergency. Factories must also close.

The store was near the place where Floyd was killed and it was heavily damaged during last week’s protests. Another store in Minneapolis remains closed, along with stores in Oakland, California; Atlanta; Philadelphia and Chicago. Target said it temporarily closed or adjusted hours at more than 200 stores over the weekend, but most were scheduled to reopen Sunday or Monday. CVS didn’t say how many stores it closed, but it said the shuttered locations are in more than 20 states and the District of Columbia. A spokeswoman for the company said pharmacies at closed stores will reroute customers to a nearby CVS so they can get prescriptions filled. “Employee and customer safety is our top priority, so we are continually monitoring protests as they occur in the communities we serve and will close stores, if needed, to help ensure the safety of employees and customers,” CVS said in a statement. Floyd, who was black and handcuffed, died while being arrested by Minneapolis police for suspicion of passing a counterfeit bill on May 25. Cellphone video showed that a white officer, Derek Chauvin, pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck for several minutes while Floyd pleaded for air and eventually stopped moving. Chauvin now faces murder and manslaughter charges. The other three officers who took part in the arrest were fired but haven’t been charged. “We are heartbroken by the death of George Floyd and the pain it is causing communities across the country,” Target said in a statement. “Our focus will remain on our team members’ safety and helping our community heal.” Target said employees at stores that are closed will be paid for up to 14 days, including premiums they are earning due to the pandemic. They will also be able to work at Target locations that remain open. Send questions/comments to the editors. « Previous Next »",0.0

In Orono, protesters gathered at the Martin Luther King Plaza on the University of Maine Campus to speak out about Floyd's death, police brutality, and racism in America. Protestors, white and black, took turns addressing the crowd. Anna-Patrice Roberts, a UMaine student, and Julianna Rogers were two of them. “(I'm here) because this has been going on for way too long, way too long. If I were to cut you and you were to cut me we would bleed the same blood,"" Rogers said. “I know ( we as people of color) are sparse, but we are here, and you need to understand our stories and our history and understand why we feel the way that we feel,"" Roberts added. Doug Allen was a co-organizer of the protest and has been a professor at UMaine for nearly 50 years. He's was apart of the 19060s Civil Rights movement and lived in India during the time of Mahatma Gandhi. NCM “(Today is about) bringing people together, connecting, and motivating them to work really hard to bring about lasting changes,"" Allen said. RELATED: 'I can't breathe': Protests over George Floyd's death reach Portland Allen added many of his students live in terror because of the color of their skin and that the problems our country faced in the past are still here in the present. “We’re trying to create a better world but it’s only possible if we do so,"" Alen said. As protestors sat, kneeled, and sang together the message was clear, Mainers are in this together.

I honestly did not expect more than a handful of people.” The protesters spent an hour sharing their thoughts and feelings then sang in unison. They did not march around campus or the town. Protesters announced they would meet again in front of Bangor City Hall at 5 p.m. Monday.

JENNIFER: TH Advertisement National coronavirus updates: Top health officials monitoring nationwide protests in fear of virus spread Share Shares Copy Link Copy The latest:There have been more than 1.9 million coronavirus cases in the United States, according to the Johns Hopkins University tally.The U.S. death toll has surpassed 110,000 people, according to Hopkins.The U.S. government's current supply of remdesivir, the only drug known to work against coronavirus, will run out at the end of the month.New World Health Organization guidance recommends that fabric masks — which can be homemade — be at least three layers.Health officials have raised concern about coronavirus spread as thousands of people are now braving a pandemic to participate in the national protests sparked by the death of George Floyd.The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Sunday it was closely monitoring the demonstrations taking place across the U.S. and warned such gatherings could spur coronavirus transmission. Some states are already seeing upward trends of new cases.For three months, the country passed one grim milestone after the other, hitting 100,000 coronavirus deaths in late May. Public health officials have said without the lockdowns that most states put in place, that death toll could have been significantly higher.As those lockdowns were lifted and other measures were loosened, the CDC and other top health officials urged Americans to use face coverings when they go out and always maintain a distance.But the large protests make it hard to keep the recommended social distancing guidelines and ""may put others at risk,"" CDC spokesperson Kristen Nordlund said in a statement.""It is too early to know what, if any, effect these events will have on the federal COVID-19 response. Every local situation is different. State and local officials will make decisions to protect public health and safety based on circumstances on the ground,"" she said.Earlier this month, CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield said protesters should be evaluated and tested for the virus.""I do think there is a potential, unfortunately, for this to be a seeding event,"" he said — especially in metropolitan areas where there has been significant transmission.So far, more than 1,942,000 people have been infected in the U.S., and at least 110,514 have died, according to Johns Hopkins University.Some states see rise in new casesWhile the early parts of the outbreak in the country hit dense metropolitan areas on the coast the hardest — including California and New York — the past few weeks have seen wider spread in inland states, including Arkansas, Texas and Arizona.In Harris County, Texas, health officials said they identified a nursing home with both cases of the virus and deaths.On Friday, health officials in Utah said they were ""very concerned"" about the rise in new cases over the past week.The state has recorded more than 12,000 infections, according to Johns Hopkins.""When you're away from home, please avoid close contact with others, and wear a mask when other social distancing measures aren't feasible,"" the Utah Department of Health said on Twitter. Utah State Rep. Suzanne Harrison called the spike of cases ""very concerning (and) approaching exponential.""""Today's 18.5% positive test rate is double yesterday's (9.4%),"" she tweeted over the weekend. ""Please be careful. Practice social distancing. Avoid crowds. Use masks where appropriate. Wash your hands.""Several universities have also reported new cases within their athletic programs — including Arkansas State, Auburn University and Oklahoma State University.An important drug could run out Meanwhile, as officials emphasize the U.S. is not yet out of the woods, a government official gave a stark warning. The U.S. government's current supply of remdesivir, the only drug known to work against coronavirus, will run out at the end of the month, Dr. Robert Kadlec, a U.S. Department of Health and Human Services official, told CNN.The government's last shipment of the drug will go out the week of June 29. Gilead Sciences, the company that makes the drug, is ramping up to make more, but it's unclear how much will be available this summer.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration gave emergency authorization for remdesivir last month. The drug, an intravenous antiviral medication studied to treat Ebola, is now used on hospitalized Covid patients. A study has shown it helps cut down the length of hospital stays.The government has been working to help Gilead ""with some of their supply chain challenges in terms of raw materials and being able to accelerate the process,"" Kadlec said.""Whatever the supply may be, there may not be enough for everyone who may need it,"" he said.",0.0

WASHINGTON — With cities wounded by days of violent unrest, America headed into a new week with neighborhoods in shambles, urban streets on lockdown and shaken confidence about when leaders would find the answers to control the mayhem amid unrelenting raw emotion over police killings of black people. All of it smashed into a nation already bludgeoned by a death toll from the coronavirus pandemic surging past 100,000 and unemployment that soared to levels not seen since the Great Depression. [Our COVID-19 tracker contains the most recent information on Maine cases by county] Sunday capped a tumultuous weekend and month that saw city and state officials deploy thousands of National Guard soldiers, enact strict curfews and shut down mass transit systems. Even with those efforts, many demonstrations erupted into violence as protesters hurled rocks and Molotov cocktails at police in Philadelphia, set a fire near the White House and were hit with tear gas and pepper spray in Austin and other cities. Seven Boston police officers were hospitalized. In some cities, thieves smashed their way into stores and ran off with as much as they could carry, leaving shop owners, many of them just ramping up their business again after coronavirus pandemic lockdowns, to clean up their shattered storefronts. In others, police tried to calm tensions by kneeling in solidarity with demonstrators, while still maintaining a strong presence for security. The demonstrations were sparked by the death of George Floyd, a black man who pleaded for air as an officer pressed a knee into his neck. Floyd’s death in Minneapolis came after tensions had already flared after two white men were arrested in May for the February shooting death of black jogger Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia, and the Louisville police shooting death of Breonna Taylor in her home in March. The scale of the coast-to-coast protests rivaled the historic demonstrations of the civil rights and Vietnam War eras. “They keep killing our people. I’m so sick and tired of it,” said Mahira Louis, 15, who was at a Boston protest with her mother Sunday, leading chants of “George Floyd, say his name.” Tensions rose Sunday outside the White House, the scene of three days of demonstrations, where police fired tear gas and stun grenades into a crowd of more than 1,000 chanting protesters across the street in Lafayette Park. The crowd ran, piling up road signs and plastic barriers to light a raging fire in a nearby street. Some pulled an American flag from a building and threw it into the blaze. A building in the park with bathrooms and a maintenance office went up in flames. The district’s entire National Guard — roughly 1,700 soldiers — was called in to help control the protests, according to two Defense Department officials who insisted on anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the matter. As the protests grew, President Donald Trump retweeted conservative commentator Buck Sexton who called for “overwhelming force” against violent demonstrators. Former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, visited the site of protests in his hometown of Wilmington, Delaware, and talked to demonstrators. He also wrote a post on Medium expressing empathy for those despairing about Floyd’s killing. At least 4,400 people have been arrested over days of protests, according to a tally compiled by The Associated Press. Arrests ranged from stealing and blocking highways to breaking curfew. In Salt Lake City, an activist leader condemned the destruction of property but said broken buildings shouldn’t be mourned on the same level as black men like Floyd. “Maybe this country will get the memo that we are sick of police murdering unarmed black men,” said Lex Scott, founder of Black Lives Matter Utah. “Maybe the next time a white police officer decides to pull the trigger, he will picture cities burning.” Yet thousands still marched peacefully in Phoenix, Albuquerque and other cities, with some calling for an end to the fires, vandalism and theft, saying it weakened calls for justice and reform. In downtown Atlanta, authorities fired tear gas to disperse hundreds of demonstrators. Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said two officers had been fired and three placed on desk duty after video showed police surrounding a car Saturday, and using stun guns on the man and woman inside. In Los Angeles, a police SUV accelerated into several protesters in a street, knocking two people to the ground. Nearby in Santa Monica, not far from a peaceful demonstration, groups broke into stores, walking out with boxes of shoes and folding chairs, among other items. A fire broke out at a restaurant across the street. Scores swarmed into nearby outlet stores in Long Beach. Some hauled armloads of clothing from a Forever 21 store away in garbage bags. In Minneapolis, the officer who pressed his knee onto Floyd’s neck has been charged with murder, but protesters are demanding the other three officers at the scene be prosecuted. All four were fired. “We’re not done,” said Darnella Wade, an organizer for Black Lives Matter in neighboring St. Paul, where thousands gathered peacefully in front of the state Capitol. “They sent us the military, and we only asked them for arrests.” Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz brought in thousands of National Guard soldiers on Saturday to help quell violence that had damaged or destroyed hundreds of buildings in Minneapolis over days of protests. That appeared to help minimize unrest, but thousands marching on a closed freeway were shaken when a semitrailer rolled into their midst. Disgust over generations of racism in a country founded by slaveholders combined with a string of recent racially charged killings to stoke the anger. Adding to that was angst from lockdowns brought on by the pandemic, which has disproportionately hurt communities of color, not only in terms of infections but in job losses and economic stress. The droves of people congregating for demonstrations threatened to trigger new outbreaks, a fact overshadowed by the boiling tensions. In Indianapolis, two people were reported dead in bursts of downtown violence this weekend, adding to deaths reported in Detroit and Minneapolis. In tweets Sunday, Trump blamed anarchists and the media for fueling violence. Attorney General William Barr pointed a finger at “far left extremist” groups. Police chiefs and politicians accused outsiders of causing the problems. At the Minneapolis intersection where Floyd was killed, people gathered with brooms and flowers, saying it was important to protect what they called a “sacred space.” Among those in Minneapolis was Michael Brown Sr., the father of Michael Brown, whose killing by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, set off unrest in 2014. “I understand what this family is feeling. I understand what this community is feeling,” he said. Associated Press writer Zeke Miller contributed to this report.",0.0
1622173599,2020-06-01 07:13:24,Civil unrest could influence Joe Biden’s search for running mate,https://bangordailynews.com/2020/06/01/national-politics/civil-unrest-could-influence-joe-bidens-search-for-running-mate/,en,False,,20320,bangordailynews.com,http://bangordailynews.com,"Matt Rourke | AP Matt Rourke | AP • June 1, 2020 7:13 am WASHINGTON — Joe Biden’s search for a running mate could be reshaped by the police killing of George Floyd and the unrest it has ignited across the country, raising questions about contenders with law-and-order backgrounds and intensifying pressure on the presumptive Democratic nominee to select a black woman. Biden, who has already pledged to pick a woman, has cast a wide net in his search. Some of the women on his list have drawn national praise amid the protests over Floyd’s death, including Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, who delivered an impassioned appeal for calm in her city on Friday night. But the outcry over police brutality against minorities has complicated the prospects of Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who had a controversial record addressing police violence as a prosecutor in the city where Floyd died. Biden’s choice of a running mate will be among the most consequential decisions he makes in the campaign, particularly given that the 77-year-old is already talking about himself as a “transition” candidate to a new generation of Democratic leaders. His pick will also be viewed as a signal both of his values and who he believes should have representation at the highest level of the American government. Even before the outcry over Floyd’s death, some Biden allies were already urging him to put a black woman on the ticket given the critical role African Americans played in his path to the Democratic nomination. Those calls have gotten louder in recent days. “The more we see this level of hatred, the more I think it’s important to confront it with symbolic acts, including potentially the selection of an African American woman as vice president,” said Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers and one of the labor leaders who’s been asked for input by Biden’s team on the selection process. Bottoms is one of several black women under consideration by Biden’s campaign. Others Biden is believed to be considering include California Sen. Kamala Harris, Florida Rep. Val Demings and Stacey Abrams, the Georgia Democrat and voting rights activist. Demings didn’t answer directly when asked if the events of the past week increased pressure on Biden to choose a black woman in an interview with The Associated Press on Sunday. “Well, we’ve never seen a black woman selected as a vice presidential candidate. But I think the American people want someone who cares about their issues and are willing to move the ball forward,” Demings said. Asked if she believes race should be left out of the conversation, she was careful to defer to Biden. “It doesn’t really matter what I think,” she said. “What matters is what Americans think, and what Joe Biden thinks.” Demings, a former Orlando police chief, wrote a high-profile editorial on Friday challenging her former colleagues in law enforcement. “As a former woman in blue, let me begin with my brothers and sisters in blue: What in the hell are you doing?” Demings wrote in The Washington Post. Politicians with law-and-order backgrounds have been viewed skeptically by some in the Democratic Party given the high-profile instances of police brutality against minorities and other inequities in the criminal justice system. In an interview Sunday, Demings defended herself and other potential contenders with such backgrounds, declaring “you’re either gonna be part of the problem or part of the solution.” “And I think the community wants people who understand the system from the inside out in order to bring real life necessary reforms,” she said. Harris faced criticism throughout her Democratic primary campaign for her record as a prosecutor and attorney general in California, when she resisted reforms that would have required her office to investigate killings by police and established statewide standards for body cameras. Former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid suggested a resume as a prosecutor could be problematic for potential contenders. “Prosecutors are not very popular, especially among young people now,” he said. “I’ve got a granddaughter who is graduating from law school and she wants to be a public defender. She doesn’t want to be a prosecutor. And I think a lot of younger people feel the same.” Klobuchar, who also sought the Democratic nomination, has faced questions about her eight years as prosecutor for Minnesota’s largest county during the primary. Most of the more than two dozen people who died during police encounters in her tenure were people of color, according to data compiled by Communities United Against Police Brutality and news articles reviewed by the AP. An officer involved in one of those past fatal incidents was Derek Chauvin, who was arrested and charged Friday with Floyd’s murder. Since ending her campaign, Klobuchar has emerged as a key Biden surrogate and some Democrats see her as a running mate who could help him appeal to some of the white, working-class voters who turned against the party in the 2016 election. Yet some Democrats say the renewed focus on police brutality could complicate her path. “This is very tough timing for her,” said Rep. James Clyburn, D-South Carolina, a top Biden ally. Klobuchar has said that she is confident Biden will make the right choice and that she’s not thinking about politics right now. Biden has said he will announce a running mate by Aug. 1, a timeline that leaves plenty of time for the national mood to shift again, particularly as the coronavirus pandemic and resulting economic collapse pressed on. Those twin crises have already led to increased scrutiny for others in the mix to become Biden’s running mate. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a frequent Trump target during the pandemic for her resistance to lifting stay at home orders, faced questions after her husband allegedly tried to skip the line with a dock company and get his boat in the water ahead of other patrons over Memorial Day weekend. And Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham of New Mexico was criticized by Republicans in her state following a report that she purchased jewelry from a local business just days after she ordered non-essential businesses to shut down and told residents to stay home. Former New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson, who was vetted as a potential vice presidential pick in 2004, said the scrutiny contenders are facing now has “proliferated.” “The scrutiny compared to when I was vetted is so much more intense and potentially troublesome for a VP candidate,” he said. Biden’s search process is still in a relatively early phase. A search committee has been meeting with power players on the left, with special attention to Democratic leaders on Capitol Hill and across organized labor. Biden, who has largely been cloistered at his home in Delaware during the pandemic, would also like to conduct in person meetings with finalists. “It’s important for him to see the candidate, talk to the candidate, get body language from the candidate. And I don’t mean one time. I think it needs to be several times,” said Cedric Richmond, a Louisiana congressman and campaign co-chair. Associated Press writers Alan Fram and Michelle L.

Gunfire erupted, killing the 26-year-old black woman. The three men turned out to be plainclothes police detectives, one of whom was wounded in the chaos and violence that March night. Taylor’s death led to protests and a review of how Louisville police use “no knock” search warrants, which allow officers to enter a home without announcing their presence, often in drug cases to prevent suspects from getting rid of a stash. Taylor’s name is one of those being chanted during nationwide protests decrying police killings of black people. The unrest began after the death of George Floyd, a black man who pleaded that he couldn’t breathe as a white Minneapolis police officer pinned him to the ground with a knee. More than two months after Taylor’s death, Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer announced last week that the police department’s use of no-knock warrants has been suspended indefinitely. Civil rights advocates are calling for a permanent ban, though Oregon and Florida are the only states that have outlawed such warrants. Fischer changed the policy after an outcry from Taylor’s family and they sued the department and the three officers who served the warrant. The new policy requires Louisville’s police chief to sign off on all no-knock warrants before they go to a judge. “These changes, and more to come … should signal that I hear the community and we will continue to make improvements anywhere that we can,” Fischer said. The three narcotics detectives had a no-knock warrant when they busted down the door of Taylor’s apartment after midnight on March 13. They were investigating a drug dealer named Jamarcus Glover, who was arrested elsewhere the same day. Police said Glover was using Taylor’s address to receive packages they believed could be drugs. No drugs were found at her apartment. Tom Wine, the city’s top criminal prosecutor, said he believes police knocked and announced their presence. “Simply because the police get a no-knock warrant does not mean they can’t knock and announce,” Wine said last week. But the lawsuit filed on behalf of Taylor’s mother says neighbors didn’t hear the plainclothes detectives knock or identify themselves as officers before they crashed into the apartment. Taylor’s boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, told investigators that he thought he was being robbed or that it might be an ex-boyfriend of Taylor’s trying to get in. Walker told police he heard knocking but didn’t know who it was. He said he and Taylor were moving toward the door when it was knocked down, so he fired a shot that hit an officer. Authorities had charged Walker with attempted murder but dropped the case last week. Wine said he wanted to let state and federal authorities complete their review of the shooting. Meanwhile, the American Civil Liberties Union of Kentucky has urged city leaders to ban no-knock warrants, saying they lead to the deaths of innocent people. A 2014 ACLU report on police militarization detailed several botched SWAT team raids as no-knock warrants were served, including one that year in Georgia that ended with a toddler in a medically induced coma. More recently, police in Montgomery County, Maryland, shot and killed 21-year-old Duncan Lemp in his family’s home while serving a no-knock search warrant. An eyewitness said Lemp was asleep in his bedroom when police opened fire from outside his house, according to an attorney for his family. Police said Lemp, who was white, was armed with a rifle and ignored commands. Lemp family attorney Rene Sandler said police began using no-knock warrants decades ago as a tool in the nation’s war on drugs. They have become the “norm” for many kinds of criminal cases, including non-violent offenses, she said. “It’s an abuse of authority across the board,” said Sandler, a former county prosecutor. Law enforcement consultant Melvin Tucker, who’s been a police chief in four cities in the U.S. South, said the element of surprise afforded by no-knock warrants isn’t always justified. “If you’re going in on a drug case where the quantity is so small that they could dispose of it by flushing it down the toilet, you probably shouldn’t be there with a search warrant in the first place. It’s not worthwhile,” said Tucker, who has been an expert witness in dozens of court cases. The number of no-knock warrants served during SWAT team deployments has grown from approximately 1,500 annually in the early 1980s to about 45,000 in 2010, according to Eastern Kentucky University professor Peter Kraska, an expert in police militarization. He said police are adept at working around restrictions and tailoring paperwork to suit the standards of judges issuing search warrants. “Banning no-knock warrants, if any jurisdiction can pull that off, is an important step,” Kraska said. “At the end of the day, banning them probably won’t accomplish much in the real world. But getting them off the books on one level is important.” Kentucky has a “stand your ground” law that gives residents the right to use deadly force against an intruder. Those laws generally haven’t protected people who unwittingly shoot at officers entering their homes, but Walker’s dropped charges suggests the circumstances of Taylor’s death could be an “ideologically compatible situation for the left and right,” Kraska said. “These different groups that normally would be at odds with one another all agree on the inappropriateness of no-knock warrants,” he added. “There’s been a lot more political agreement that this is problematic.”",0.0

A truck driver drove into demonstrators in Minneapolis nearly a week after George Floyd died there after pleading for air as an officer pressed a knee into his neck. Protests sprang up from Boston to San Francisco, with people stealing from stores in broad daylight in Philadelphia, cities across California and elsewhere. In Minneapolis, the tanker truck sped into a peaceful crowd of thousands on a closed highway, but no one appeared to have been hit, authorities said. The Minnesota State Patrol said on Twitter that the driver’s actions were “very disturbing” and he was arrested. Protesters swarmed the truck and jumped on the hood, even as it kept moving. Police then came in force to clear the highway in the city where violence erupted after the death last week of Floyd, who was black. The protests quickly spread to dozens of cities large and small, and have lasted for days. The officer who pressed his knee onto Floyd’s neck for several minutes has been charged with murder, but protesters demand the other three officers at the scene be prosecuted. All four were fired. “We’re not done,” said Darnella Wade, organizer for Black Lives Matter in neighboring St. Paul, where thousands gathered peacefully in front of the state Capitol. “They sent us the military, and we only asked them for arrests.” Minnesota’s governor brought in thousands of National Guard soldiers to help quell violence that had damaged or destroyed hundreds of buildings in Minneapolis over days of protests. The immense deployment appeared to have worked Saturday night, when there was comparatively little destruction. On Sunday, in a display of force, long lines of state patrolmen and National Guard soldiers were lined up in front of the Capitol, facing the demonstrators, with perhaps a dozen military-style armored vehicles behind them. For a second day, the protests reached to the White House, where chants could be heard from around 1,000 demonstrators just across the street in Lafayette Park as they faced police in riot gear behind barricades. The scene was defiant but peaceful, though police used flash bangs to stop another group from reaching the park. As the protests grew, President Trump retweeted conservative commentator Buck Sexton who called for “overwhelming force.” Outside the White House, Gabrielle Labrosse-Ellis, 30, from Maryland, held a sign that said, “Humanize black lives.” “This is unacceptable. This is the last straw,” she said. “It has to be.” Labrosse-Ellis said she planned to leave before dark because she feared a repeat of the violence that occurred Saturday night. Across America, demonstrators called again for an end to police violence and many joined police in pleading for an end to the looting Many also joined police in pleading for a stop to fires, vandalism and theft, saying it weakened calls for justice and reform. “They keep killing our people,” said Mahira Louis, 15, who marched with her mother and several hundred others through downtown Boston. “I’m so sick and tired of it.” Disgust over generations of racism in a country founded by slaveholders combined with a string of recent racially charged killings to stoke the anger. Adding to that was angst from months of lockdowns brought on by the coronavirus pandemic, which has disproportionately hurt communities of color, not only in terms of infections but in job losses and economic stress. The droves of people congregating for demonstrations threatened to trigger new outbreaks, a fact overshadowed by the boiling tensions. “Maybe this country will get the memo that we are sick of police murdering unarmed black men,” said Lex Scott, founder of Black Lives Matter Utah. “Maybe the next time a white police officer decides to pull the trigger, he will picture cities burning.” The scale of the protests, sweeping from coast to coast and unfolding on a single night, rivaled the historic demonstrations of the civil rights and Vietnam War eras. Curfews were imposed in major cities around the U.S., including Atlanta, Chicago, Denver, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Seattle. About 5,000 National Guard soldiers and airmen were activated in 15 states and Washington, D.C. But still trouble flared. There was looting on both ends of California, with video in San Jose showing several people in hoods and masks fleeing a Macy’s department store with large bags, while people in Long Beach carried away armloads of clothing and other goods from the smashed windows of stores at a shopping mall after curfew. As police moved in to try to restore order, some protesters ran in to confront the thieves and condemn them for undercutting the message of the demonstration. In tweets Sunday, Trump blamed anarchists and the media for fueling the violence. Attorney General William Barr pointed a finger at “far left extremist” groups. Police chiefs and politicians accused outsiders of coming in and causing the problems. At the Minneapolis intersection where Floyd was killed, people gathered with brooms and flowers, saying it was important to protect what they called a “sacred space.” The intersection was blocked with the traffic cones while a ring of flowers was laid out. Among those descending on Minneapolis was Michael Brown Sr., the father of Michael Brown, whose killing by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, set off unrest in 2014. “I understand what this family is feeling. I understand what this community is feeling,” he said. In Indianapolis, two people were reported dead in bursts of downtown violence, adding to deaths reported in Detroit and Minneapolis in recent days. Buildings around the U.S. were defaced with spray-painted messages, from the facade of St. Patrick’s Cathedral in New York to the historic Hay-Adams hotel near the White House. Some of Floyd’s gasped last words — “I can’t breathe” — were repeated, alongside anti-police messages. Send questions/comments to the editors. « Previous Next »",0.0
1622245688,2020-05-31 18:19:12,"Officials see extremist groups, disinformation in protests",https://www.centralmaine.com/2020/05/31/officials-see-extremist-groups-disinformation-in-protests/,en,False,,25755,Central Maine News,https://www.centralmaine.com/,"WASHINGTON — U.S. officials sought to determine Sunday whether extremist groups had infiltrated police brutality protests across the country and deliberately tipped largely peaceful demonstrations toward violence — and if foreign adversaries were behind a burgeoning disinformation campaign on social media. As demonstrations spread from Minneapolis to the White House, New York City and overseas, federal law enforcement officials insisted far-left groups were stoking violence. Meanwhile, experts who track extremist groups also reported seeing evidence of the far-right at work. Investigators were also tracking online interference and looking into whether foreign agents were behind the effort. Officials have seen a surge of social media accounts with fewer than 200 followers created in the last month, a textbook sign of a disinformation effort. The accounts have posted graphic images of the protests, material on police brutality and material on the coronavirus pandemic that appeared designed to inflame tensions across the political divide, according to three administration officials. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss investigations. The investigations are an attempt to identify the network of forces behind some of the most widespread outbreak of civil unrest in the U.S. in decades. Protests erupted in dozens of cities in recent days, triggered by the death of George Floyd, who died after he was pinned at the neck by a white Minneapolis police officer. Pandemic-weary Americans were already angry — about COVID-19 deaths, lockdown orders and tens of millions of people out of work. The pandemic has hit African Americans harder than whites in the U.S., and the killings of black people by police have continued over the years even as the topic faded from the national stage. But there are signs of people with other disparate motives, including anarchist graffiti, arrests of some out-of-state protesters, and images circulating in extremist groups that suggest the involvement of outside groups. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said Sunday that state authorities were hit with a cyber attack as law enforcement prepared to diffuse protests in Minneapolis and St. Paul, the epicenter of the unrest. He described it as a “very sophisticated denial of service attack on all computers.” President Trump, Attorney General William Bar and others have said the left-wing extremist group antifa is to blame. Short for anti-fascists, antifa is an umbrella term for far-left-leaning militant groups that resist neo-Nazis and white supremacists at demonstrations. Barr on Sunday said the FBI would use its regional joint terrorism task forces to “identify criminal organizers,” and Trump threatened again to name antifa a terrorist group. The Justice Department is also deploying members of the U.S. Marshals Service and agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration on Sunday to supplement National Guard troops outside the White House, a senior department official said. The official was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. The addition of the federal agents, who will have armored vehicles, came as Barr warned that prosecutors could seek to use terrorism statutes against “violent radical agitators” who attempt to hijack protests to cause destruction. An antifa activist group disseminated a message in a Telegram channel on Saturday that encouraged people to consider Minnesota National Guard troops “easy targets,” two Defense Department officials said. The message encouraged activists to steal “kit,” meaning the weapons and body armor used by the soldiers. The officials were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. As a result, soldiers with the Minnesota National Guard were armed during their mission at protests across the state Sunday, the officials said. The soldiers are sometimes armed but had not been since they moved into parts of the state that had been besieged by riots in the last few days. The troops do not have the authority to make arrests, and are there to act mostly as extra security for police. Others have seen evidence of right-wing extremists. J.J. MacNab, a fellow at George Washington University’s Program on Extremism, has been monitoring chatter about the protests among anti-government extremists on social media platforms. She has access to dozens of private Facebook groups for followers of the loosely organized “Boogaloo” movement, which uses an ’80s movie sequel as a code word for a second civil war. She also has been poring over images from the weekend protests and spotted some “boogaloo bois” in the crowds, carrying high-powered rifles and wearing tactical gear. “They want to co-opt them in order to start their war. They see themselves as being on the side of protesters and that the protesters themselves are useful in causing anarchy,” MacNab said. She also sees signs that the Three Percenters militia movement appears to be taking an interest. Megan Squire, an Elon University computer science professor who tracks online extremism, saw images of at least four members of the far-right Proud Boys group on the periphery of a protest Saturday night in Raleigh, North Carolina. Trump was expected in the coming days to draw distinctions between the legitimate anger of peaceful protesters and the unacceptable actions of violent agitators, said a White House official who was not authorized to discuss the plans ahead of time and spoke on condition of anonymity. The Trump administration has largely remained silent on local reports that far-right protesters were also involved. Meanwhile, Democratic mayors said Trump’s handling of the crisis was reminiscent of one of the darkest moments of his presidency — when he said there were “good people on both sides” of protests in 2017 over white supremacists demonstrating in Charlottesville, Virginia. America’s racial fault lines are a perfect opportunity for foreign adversaries looking to sow discord and portray the U.S. in a negative light, according to James Ludes, director of the Pell Center for International Relations and Public Policy at Salve Regina University in Rhode Island. “This is a real issue and Americans are legitimately upset about it,” said Ludes, who studies foreign disinformation tactics. “That’s one of the hallmarks of these campaigns. You don’t create new issues, you exploit existing issues.” There’s a history of this. In 2016, another black man, Philando Castile, was killed by police in a Minneapolis suburb, his death livestreamed on Facebook. Russians used a fake Black Lives Matter page to confuse and stoke anger among the protesters. There were nearly 700,000 followers, but it’s not clear how many were real. One debunked example from this week: That Atlanta had deployed a “child militia.” Floyd was accused of trying to pass a bad bill at a grocery store after he was laid off in the pandemic. Disturbing video showed him prone on the street, while a white police officer pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck even as he cried he couldn’t breathe. He later died. The officers have been fired; Derek Chauvin, the officer who pinned Floyd in the video, was charged with murder. At first there were peaceful demonstrations, but violence soon erupted. A Minneapolis police station was torched and protests took off around the country, growing increasingly tense. Video showed a police vehicle ramming into demonstrators in New York. Meanwhile, a van with four New York Police Department officers inside was hit with a Molotov cocktail and torched. Hundreds have been arrested nationwide and cities braced for more protests. But booking information from the county jail in Minneapolis, for example, showed that out of 59 protest-related arrests, 47 people had a home address in Minnesota, with the majority coming from the Twin Cities. Before protests began in New York City, organizers of anarchist groups began raising money for bail, recruited medical teams to deploy for violent interactions with police and planned how to target high-end stores, said John Miller, the NYPD’s deputy commissioner of intelligence and counterterrorism. Scouts on bicycles would also move ahead of the groups to report where the police would be and then direct small breakaway groups to areas where they could torch police cars or throw Molotov cocktails, Miller said. The NYPD has arrested 786 people related to protests since May 28 and 1 in 7 of them were not from New York City, he said. In Washington, where protesters raged outside the White House, most of the 17 people arrested were from the area. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser said the groups seemed, at the least, organized to destroy with tools to break windows and distribute materials. Send questions/comments to the editors. « Previous Next »",0.0
1622245683,2020-05-31 18:59:00,World alarmed by violence in U.S.,https://www.centralmaine.com/2020/05/31/world-alarmed-by-violence-in-u-s/,en,False,,25755,Central Maine News,https://www.centralmaine.com/,"LONDON — Nations around the world have watched in horror at the civil unrest in the United States following the death of George Floyd, a black man who died after a white police officer pressed his knee on his neck until he stopped breathing. Racism-tinged events no longer startle even America’s closest allies, though many have watched coverage of the often-violent protests with growing unease. Burning cars and riot police in the U.S. featured on newspaper front pages around the globe Sunday – bumping news of the COVID-19 pandemic to second-tier status in some places. Floyd’s death on May 25 in Minneapolis was the latest in a series of deaths of black men and women at the hands of police in the U.S. Thousands gathered in central London on Sunday to offer support for American demonstrators. Chanting “No justice! No peace!” and waving placards with the words “How many more?” at Trafalgar Square, the protesters ignored U.K. government rules banning crowds because of the pandemic. Police didn’t stop them. Demonstrators then marched to the U.S. Embassy, where a long line of officers surrounded the building. Several hundred milled around in the street and waved placards. Protesters in Denmark also converged on the U.S. Embassy on Sunday. Participants carried placards with messages such as “Stop Killing Black People.” The U.S. Embassy in Berlin was the scene of protests on Saturday under the motto: “Justice for George Floyd.” Several hundred more people took to the streets Sunday in the capital’s Kreuzberg area, carrying signs with slogans like “Silence is Violence,” “Hold Cops Accountable,” and “Who Do You Call When Police Murder?” No incidents were reported. Germany’s top-selling Bild newspaper on Sunday carried the sensational headline “This killer-cop set America ablaze” with an arrow pointing to a photo of now-fired police officer Derek Chauvin, who has been charged with third-degree murder in Floyd’s death, with his knee on Floyd’s neck. The newspaper’s story reported “scenes like out of a civil war.” In Italy, the Corriere della Sera newspaper’s senior U.S. correspondent Massimo Gaggi wrote that the reaction to Floyd’s killing was “different” than previous cases of black Americans killed by police and the ensuring violence. “There are exasperated black movements that no longer preach nonviolent resistance,” Gaggi wrote, noting the Minnesota governor’s warning that “anarchist and white supremacy groups are trying to fuel the chaos.” In countries with authoritarian governments, state-controlled media have been highlighting the chaos and violence of the U.S. demonstrations, in part to undermine American officials’ criticism of their own nations. In China, the protests are being viewed through the prism of U.S. government criticism of China’s crackdown on anti-government protests in Hong Kong. Hu Xijin, the editor of the state-owned Global Times newspaper, tweeted that U.S. officials can now see protests out their own windows: “I want to ask Speaker Pelosi and Secretary Pompeo: Should Beijing support protests in the U.S., like you glorified rioters in Hong Kong?” Hua Chunying, a Chinese Foreign ministry spokeswoman, pointed out America’s racial unrest by tweeting “I can’t breathe,” which Floyd said before his death. In Iran, which has violently put down nationwide demonstrations by killing hundreds, arresting thousands and disrupting internet access to the outside world, state television has repeatedly aired images of the U.S. unrest. One TV anchor discussed “a horrible scene from New York, where police attacked protesters.” Another state TV message accused U.S. police agencies in Washington of “setting fire to cars and attacking protesters,” without offering any evidence. Russia accused the United States of “systemic problems in the human rights sphere.” It denounced Floyd’s death as the latest in a series of police violence cases against African Americans. “This incident is far from the first in a series of lawless conduct and unjustified violence from U.S. law enforcement,’’ the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement. “American police commit such high-profile crimes all too often.’’ There also have been expressions of solidarity with the demonstrators. In Brazil, hundreds of people gathered in front of the Rio de Janeiro state government palace to protest crimes committed by the police against black people in Rio’s working-class neighborhoods, known as favelas. The protest, called “Black lives matter,” was interrupted when police used tear gas to disperse people. “I can’t breathe”, said some of the demonstrators, alluding to the George Floyd’s death. Protesters called for an end to police operations inside favelas. They shouted the names of some victims followed by the word “present!” Rio has one of the most deadly police in Brazil. In 2019 they killed 1,546 people, the highest number since 1998, and much of that was during police operations in favelas. Over the weekend, Lebanese anti-government protesters flooded social media with tweets sympathetic to U.S. protesters, using the hashtag #Americarevolts. That’s a play on the slogan for Lebanon’s protest movement – Lebanon revolts – which erupted on Oct. 17 last year. Within 24 hours, the hashtag #Americanrevolts became the No. 1 trending tag in Lebanon. In another expression of solidarity with American protesters, about 150 people marched through central Jerusalem on Saturday to protest the shooting death by Israeli police of an unarmed, autistic Palestinian man earlier in the day. Israeli police mistakenly suspected that the man, Iyad Halak, was carrying a weapon. When he failed to obey orders to stop, officers opened fire.

Marcus Smart attended a protest Sunday night in Boston, as did Vincent Poirier, according to NBC Sports Boston’s A. Sherrod Blakely. Smart sported a “despite color or gender” hoodie and stopped to tell Blakely why he was there. “It’s not right,” Smart said. “So we’re going to have to come out here and have our voice be heard because we stand for the truth. We stand for justice. And we won’t stop until we get justice. “And that’s really what this is about. And I just want to say to every one that thinks this is something more than it is: It’s not. Despite color or gender, the truth is the truth. Justice is justice. “And justice hasn’t been served and people are pissed off about it. So we’re here to keep George Floyd’s name alive and keep it going in his legacy. Something has to change, and we’re here trying to make a change.” Though Floyd was handcuffed, Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin knelt on his neck for an extended period of time until the 46-year-old man became unresponsive. Video of the incident surfaced with Floyd repeatedly telling Chauvin he couldn’t breathe and calling out for his deceased mother. Protests have continued across the country. On Saturday night, Brown drove 15 hours to Atlanta to lead a peaceful protest of his own. He posted an Instagram video encouraging others to follow his lead. “Being a bystander is no longer acceptable,” Brown wrote. “If you and your friends are around or are witnesses to cultural biases, micro-aggressions, subtle acts of racism, actual racism etc. and you don’t speak up on it or do something about it, you are part of the problem. We’re past the point where if it’s not in your governance space so you have nothing to do with it. If you don’t speak up on these issues, you just as bad.” In Massachusetts, the protestors have Governor Charlie Baker’s blessing. “If people choose to protest, we need to make sure they have the ability to do that,” Baker said Friday. “We hope people protest peacefully but honestly, a moment like that, an event like that, I can’t imagine why people wouldn’t want to get out on the streets and make a point about it.” Send questions/comments to the editors. « Previous Next »",0.0

You don’t create new issues, you exploit existing issues.” There’s a history of this. In 2016, another black man, Philando Castile, was killed by police in a Minneapolis suburb, his death livestreamed on Facebook. Russians used a fake Black Lives Matter page to confuse and stoke anger among the protesters. There were nearly 700,000 followers, but it’s not clear how many were real. One debunked example from this week: That Atlanta had deployed a “child militia.” Floyd was accused of trying to pass a bad bill at a grocery store after he was laid off in the pandemic. Disturbing video showed him prone on the street, while a white police officer pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck even as he cried he couldn’t breathe. He later died. The officers have been fired; Derek Chauvin, the officer who pinned Floyd in the video, was charged with murder. At first there were peaceful demonstrations, but violence soon erupted. A Minneapolis police station was torched and protests took off around the country, growing increasingly tense. Video showed a police vehicle ramming into demonstrators in New York. Meanwhile, a van with four New York Police Department officers inside was hit with a Molotov cocktail and torched. Hundreds have been arrested nationwide and cities braced for more protests. But booking information from the county jail in Minneapolis, for example, showed that out of 59 protest-related arrests, 47 people had a home address in Minnesota, with the majority coming from the Twin Cities. Before protests began in New York City, organizers of anarchist groups began raising money for bail, recruited medical teams to deploy for violent interactions with police and planned how to target high-end stores, said John Miller, the NYPD’s deputy commissioner of intelligence and counterterrorism. Scouts on bicycles would also move ahead of the groups to report where the police would be and then direct small breakaway groups to areas where they could torch police cars or throw Molotov cocktails, Miller said. The NYPD has arrested 786 people related to protests since May 28 and 1 in 7 of them were not from New York City, he said. In Washington, where protesters raged outside the White House, most of the 17 people arrested were from the area. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser said the groups seemed, at the least, organized to destroy with tools to break windows and distribute materials. Send questions/comments to the editors. « Previous Next »",0.0
1622261613,2020-05-31 18:59:00,World alarmed by violence in U.S.,https://www.centralmaine.com/2020/05/31/world-alarmed-by-violence-in-u-s/,en,False,,29592,onlinesentinel.com,http://www.onlinesentinel.com#spider,"LONDON — Nations around the world have watched in horror at the civil unrest in the United States following the death of George Floyd, a black man who died after a white police officer pressed his knee on his neck until he stopped breathing. Racism-tinged events no longer startle even America’s closest allies, though many have watched coverage of the often-violent protests with growing unease. Burning cars and riot police in the U.S. featured on newspaper front pages around the globe Sunday – bumping news of the COVID-19 pandemic to second-tier status in some places. Floyd’s death on May 25 in Minneapolis was the latest in a series of deaths of black men and women at the hands of police in the U.S. Thousands gathered in central London on Sunday to offer support for American demonstrators. Chanting “No justice! No peace!” and waving placards with the words “How many more?” at Trafalgar Square, the protesters ignored U.K. government rules banning crowds because of the pandemic. Police didn’t stop them. Demonstrators then marched to the U.S. Embassy, where a long line of officers surrounded the building. Several hundred milled around in the street and waved placards. Protesters in Denmark also converged on the U.S. Embassy on Sunday. Participants carried placards with messages such as “Stop Killing Black People.” The U.S. Embassy in Berlin was the scene of protests on Saturday under the motto: “Justice for George Floyd.” Several hundred more people took to the streets Sunday in the capital’s Kreuzberg area, carrying signs with slogans like “Silence is Violence,” “Hold Cops Accountable,” and “Who Do You Call When Police Murder?” No incidents were reported. Germany’s top-selling Bild newspaper on Sunday carried the sensational headline “This killer-cop set America ablaze” with an arrow pointing to a photo of now-fired police officer Derek Chauvin, who has been charged with third-degree murder in Floyd’s death, with his knee on Floyd’s neck. The newspaper’s story reported “scenes like out of a civil war.” In Italy, the Corriere della Sera newspaper’s senior U.S. correspondent Massimo Gaggi wrote that the reaction to Floyd’s killing was “different” than previous cases of black Americans killed by police and the ensuring violence. “There are exasperated black movements that no longer preach nonviolent resistance,” Gaggi wrote, noting the Minnesota governor’s warning that “anarchist and white supremacy groups are trying to fuel the chaos.” In countries with authoritarian governments, state-controlled media have been highlighting the chaos and violence of the U.S. demonstrations, in part to undermine American officials’ criticism of their own nations. In China, the protests are being viewed through the prism of U.S. government criticism of China’s crackdown on anti-government protests in Hong Kong. Hu Xijin, the editor of the state-owned Global Times newspaper, tweeted that U.S. officials can now see protests out their own windows: “I want to ask Speaker Pelosi and Secretary Pompeo: Should Beijing support protests in the U.S., like you glorified rioters in Hong Kong?” Hua Chunying, a Chinese Foreign ministry spokeswoman, pointed out America’s racial unrest by tweeting “I can’t breathe,” which Floyd said before his death. In Iran, which has violently put down nationwide demonstrations by killing hundreds, arresting thousands and disrupting internet access to the outside world, state television has repeatedly aired images of the U.S. unrest. One TV anchor discussed “a horrible scene from New York, where police attacked protesters.” Another state TV message accused U.S. police agencies in Washington of “setting fire to cars and attacking protesters,” without offering any evidence. Russia accused the United States of “systemic problems in the human rights sphere.” It denounced Floyd’s death as the latest in a series of police violence cases against African Americans. “This incident is far from the first in a series of lawless conduct and unjustified violence from U.S. law enforcement,’’ the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement. “American police commit such high-profile crimes all too often.’’ There also have been expressions of solidarity with the demonstrators. In Brazil, hundreds of people gathered in front of the Rio de Janeiro state government palace to protest crimes committed by the police against black people in Rio’s working-class neighborhoods, known as favelas. The protest, called “Black lives matter,” was interrupted when police used tear gas to disperse people. “I can’t breathe”, said some of the demonstrators, alluding to the George Floyd’s death. Protesters called for an end to police operations inside favelas. They shouted the names of some victims followed by the word “present!” Rio has one of the most deadly police in Brazil. In 2019 they killed 1,546 people, the highest number since 1998, and much of that was during police operations in favelas. Over the weekend, Lebanese anti-government protesters flooded social media with tweets sympathetic to U.S. protesters, using the hashtag #Americarevolts. That’s a play on the slogan for Lebanon’s protest movement – Lebanon revolts – which erupted on Oct. 17 last year. Within 24 hours, the hashtag #Americanrevolts became the No. 1 trending tag in Lebanon. In another expression of solidarity with American protesters, about 150 people marched through central Jerusalem on Saturday to protest the shooting death by Israeli police of an unarmed, autistic Palestinian man earlier in the day. Israeli police mistakenly suspected that the man, Iyad Halak, was carrying a weapon. When he failed to obey orders to stop, officers opened fire.

Marcus Smart attended a protest Sunday night in Boston, as did Vincent Poirier, according to NBC Sports Boston’s A. Sherrod Blakely. Smart sported a “despite color or gender” hoodie and stopped to tell Blakely why he was there. “It’s not right,” Smart said. “So we’re going to have to come out here and have our voice be heard because we stand for the truth. We stand for justice. And we won’t stop until we get justice. “And that’s really what this is about. And I just want to say to every one that thinks this is something more than it is: It’s not. Despite color or gender, the truth is the truth. Justice is justice. “And justice hasn’t been served and people are pissed off about it. So we’re here to keep George Floyd’s name alive and keep it going in his legacy. Something has to change, and we’re here trying to make a change.” Though Floyd was handcuffed, Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin knelt on his neck for an extended period of time until the 46-year-old man became unresponsive. Video of the incident surfaced with Floyd repeatedly telling Chauvin he couldn’t breathe and calling out for his deceased mother. Protests have continued across the country. On Saturday night, Brown drove 15 hours to Atlanta to lead a peaceful protest of his own. He posted an Instagram video encouraging others to follow his lead. “Being a bystander is no longer acceptable,” Brown wrote. “If you and your friends are around or are witnesses to cultural biases, micro-aggressions, subtle acts of racism, actual racism etc. and you don’t speak up on it or do something about it, you are part of the problem. We’re past the point where if it’s not in your governance space so you have nothing to do with it. If you don’t speak up on these issues, you just as bad.” In Massachusetts, the protestors have Governor Charlie Baker’s blessing. “If people choose to protest, we need to make sure they have the ability to do that,” Baker said Friday. “We hope people protest peacefully but honestly, a moment like that, an event like that, I can’t imagine why people wouldn’t want to get out on the streets and make a point about it.” Send questions/comments to the editors. « Previous Next »",0.0
1622271851,2020-06-01 09:04:54,View from Away: Stop focusing on looting in Minneapolis. Be outraged that police keep killing black men,https://www.centralmaine.com/2020/06/01/view-from-away-stop-focusing-on-looting-in-minneapolis-be-outraged-that-police-keep-killing-black-men/,en,False,,25755,Central Maine News,https://www.centralmaine.com/,"There is anger on the streets in Minneapolis. And Los Angeles. And Columbus and Phoenix and Denver. It is deserved anger fed by the death of George Floyd, yet another unarmed black man killed as police arrested him. Another. That’s the key word. The mature and reasoned response is, of course, to explore what went wrong on that Minneapolis street on Memorial Day. Why did the police officers responsible for this unnecessary use of force still have badges, given their history of previous complaints? Why did it take so long for authorities to arrest the officer filmed pinning Floyd to the ground with a knee on his neck? What can Minneapolis — or Los Angeles, or Ferguson, Missouri, or New York City — do to improve relations between police and the communities they serve? Cue up the commission, bring in the experts, hold some hearings, let people vent for a bit and then, by golly, we’ll have change. That’s the lie we tell ourselves with depressing regularity. The solutions we keep trotting out fail to address the real fault lines here. Police now often carry body cameras, undergo implicit bias training and embrace community policing strategies aimed at bridging the divide. We keep looking for the technology or training that can be bought and implemented to end police brutality, and there have been some improvements, particularly in cities where police departments have restricted use of force in making arrests. But progress is not victory. And this is not a technology problem, or something that can be ended with some policy tinkering. It is a function of deep structural racism that we as a nation have proved to be incapable of exorcising. Los Angeles burned in 1965 when a white California Highway Patrol officer pulled over a black motorist, starting a cascade of events that quickly released a community’s pent-up rage and frustration over police conduct. Detroit burned in 1967 after a police raid on an after-hours bar filled with African Americans similarly breached a dam holding back years of anger over police violence against black neighborhoods. Newark, N.J., burned that year too, a single arrest and beating of a black man unleashing years of community frustration. These upheavals reflected years of rising anger in African American neighborhoods over the conditions of their existence and the excesses of police departments that, as the motto says, were there to protect and to serve. Then came the 1991 police beating of Rodney King, all the proof Los Angeles needed that history does repeat itself. And no, police violence does not justify the rampages that erupted in Minneapolis. But as the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. pointed out more than a half-century ago, “a riot is the language of the unheard.” To focus on the damage and looting misses the point. Were it not for the killing of Floyd, and the history of police behavior, there would have been no protests. According to one analysis, unarmed black Americans today are five times more likely to be killed by police than unarmed white Americans. We can blame some of that on over-policing, itself often an expression of unacknowledged bias. But the threat comes not just from people with badges. It crops up in daily life in the most mundane ways: A white woman calling New York City police on a black man out bird-watching who had the gall to ask her to leash her dog. A white man — again in Minneapolis — calling security when four black men rejected his demand for identification proving that they had permission to use the gym in a building where they all worked. A Starbucks manager calling police in Philadelphia to arrest two black men who were waiting to meet a potential business partner. That’s not the police sparking a racially framed encounter; it is white Americans surfacing the structural racism that, in its worst excesses, ends with the deaths of black Americans. Trayvon Martin. Ahmaud Arbery. Their killings did not involve police. Yet it is in the intersection of structural racism and the police — the people whom we empower and arm to enforce laws — where such violence resonates with such ferocity. Floyd’s death, as Minneapolis City Councilwoman Andrea Jenkins said, “was a symbol for a knee on the neck of black America.” That knee has been there for an unconscionably long time. Too long.

A volunteer from the neighborhood walks out onto Lake Street. ""Is this your business?"" she asks. Safia and her daughter Saida Hassan nod silently. ""I'm sorry,"" the woman says. It's the first time they've seen it since fiery protests erupted among cries for racial justice and as state troopers in riot gear blocked the road to this street. The walls are charred black, the kitchen reduced to rubble. Glass and water are swimming in puddles as community members around them work to sweep away the destruction. Safia looks around stunned. Hers is one of hundreds of businesses damaged or destroyed in protests on Thursday and Friday night. ""Alhamdulillah,"" she repeats quietly. Praise God. ""Everyone is safe."" ""My heart is broken. My mind is broken,"" she says. ""I know I can't come back from this. But this can be replaced. George's life cannot. George's life was more important. That man that got killed in the most inhumane way. I hope he gets justice."" George Floyd is the African American man who died after a white police officer pinned his neck to the ground with his knee for several minutes last Monday. Protests started in Minneapolis early last week and quickly spread across the country. Floyd's pleading words to the officer, ""I can't breathe,"" are now a rallying cry for people protesting the many black people who have died in police custody. Safia, a Somali immigrant, opened the restaurant in December 2018 with her retirement savings. In the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, she closed the restaurant and had to choose between paying for insurance and paying staff. So Safia chose her staff. That means there are no funds to rebuild. A GoFundMe page has been set up to help the family. This weekend, she had planned to reopen as the city started easing stay-at-home orders. She spent over $4,000 on groceries and cleanup. Now that plan is gone. ""It's not just me,"" she says. ""It's all of Lake Street, all of Minneapolis."" Her daughter Saida nods. ""This is a city in pain,"" Saida says. Across the street a row of restaurants — all locally owned, black- and immigrant-owned — are all gone. But the library is OK. In the rubble, Saida finds the sign she made for her mother when the restaurant first opened. Against the black ash the wood plaque is pristine. It reads ""Mama Safia's Kitchen. Seasoned with Love."" ""Because she always cooks with love,"" Saida says. She pulls a few more knickknacks that haven't burned. ""Most of the artifacts here, I got them from Africa,"" she says. ""This one is from Somalia."" She puts them into a tiny pile of what is salvageable. Outside is a tower of all that is lost. Her sister Bibi Abdullah walks in to help. She finds prayer rugs in the banquet room her mom would rent out for small wedding dinners and religious holidays. ""We can still use these,"" she says. ""We just have to wash them."" She searches for more things she can save. ""The truth is things like this happen when people feel powerless. Something has to change,"" Bibi says. Her voice catches. Her body seems to vibrate with a mix of anger and sadness. She says she hopes that these demonstrations translate to voters at the polls come November. ""It came to this because we have people that do not care in positions of power and it should not be that way,"" Bibi says. She and her sister start to clear the big debris together. Then Saida leads her mother, Safia, to the kitchen in the back so they can assess the damage. It's a tunnel of charred walls, ash and debris. Safia gets upset and pulls away, speaking to her daughter in Somali. ""I'm sorry, I'm sorry,"" Saida responds in English as her mother walks out. ""She's just saying, 'Why are you bringing me in here? I don't want to see this,' "" Saida says. Saida gets quiet. She stands in the kitchen alone for a moment, staring at the charred walls. Then she joins her family outside where dozens of Minneapolis residents from across the city are working in groups to clear the rubble. With everything unfolding, the pandemic has slipped many people's minds. ""I forgot. Have you seen me shake hands with people?"" Saida shakes her head. ""2020, we hear you, we see you. We went from one crisis to the next. What's next?"" Saida spends every night protesting, but also trying to protect other locally owned stores and restaurants. At night, she cries herself to sleep. She understands the anger and desperation that are leading some to destroy buildings. ""I'm like emotionally torn,"" Saida says. She doesn't want destruction. ""But at the same time, people are crying for help. People are saying, 'Fix this.' "" She says she hopes, from all of this pain, finally there will be change. ",0.0
1622276517,2020-06-01 05:00:00,Trump Seems Likely To Use Law And Order As A Wedge Issue After George Floyd's Killing,https://www.mainepublic.org/post/trump-seems-likely-use-law-and-order-wedge-issue-after-george-floyds-killing,en,False,,79928,mpbn.net,http://www.mpbn.net/#spider,"Through days of unrest, dozens of American cities — from Minneapolis to Atlanta, from New York to Grand Rapids, Mich. — have been wracked by violent protests. Racial wounds have been ripped open following the death of George Floyd, an unarmed black man in police custody in Minneapolis. The chaotic demonstrations and looting across the country have been blamed on outsiders of various political stripes, particularly ""radical-left"" groups like antifa, which is short for ""anti-fascist."" But the country is at an especially explosive moment, coming in the midst of a pandemic that has already killed more than 100,000 and an economic crisis with more than 40 million Americans unemployed — and in an election year no less. There's no telling how this plays out politically in November, with the election now five months away. Anything can happen. Five months ago, after all, the coronavirus was just a ""pneumonia of unknown cause."" President Trump called Floyd's death a ""grave tragedy"" that ""should never have happened."" Those remarks were made at the first launching of American astronauts into space from U.S. soil in almost a decade — what was one of the hopeful bright spots in this country, though it was overshadowed by the violent demonstrations. But once Trump was back on his favorite platform, Twitter, he again inflamed tensions, with machismo and politics at the forefront. He criticized local Democratic officials, saying Minneapolis's mayor, for example, was no ""General Douglas McArthur [sic] or great fighter General George Patton."" He has called demonstrators ""THUGS"" and warned that ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts"" — though he later said he didn't use that phrase as a threat. And he has employed violent, tough-guy imagery, alluding to the potential use of ""unlimited"" military power, ""vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons."" Even some Republicans criticized the president's language. Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, the only black Republican in the Senate, called the president's tweets ""not constructive"" on Fox News Sunday. And Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan told CNN that Trump is ""continuing to escalate the temperature,"" which is the ""opposite"" of what a leader should be doing right now. Meanwhile, Trump's national security adviser, Robert O'Brien, on Sunday waded into a crucial debate — whether there's ""systemic racism"" in police forces or whether there are just a few ""bad apples."" ""I don't think there's systemic racism"" in law enforcement, O'Brien said on CNN, ""but, you know what, there are some bad apples in there. ... There's no doubt there are some racist police"" but, he said, they're the minority. Americans are divided on their views of police. Back in mid-2017, Gallup found that 54% of Americans have a great deal or quite a lot of confidence in the police. But there were very different views by race. While 61% of whites had that level of confidence in police, just 45% of Hispanics and 30% of blacks did. Confidence in police nosedived among minorities and liberals after the rash of high-profile incidents of black men killed at the hands of police in 2014 and 2015, such as Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., Eric Garner in New York and Freddie Gray in Baltimore. Views of the police and law enforcement have become a sharp dividing line by race and party. In 2016, Trump declared himself the ""law and order candidate."" Expect him to try to exploit that again as a wedge issue in an effort to win over moderate whites upset by the video of Floyd's death but disapproving of the violent demonstrations. He said as much Sunday. He called for ""Law & Order in Philadelphia, NOW!"" and announced that the United States would be designating antifa a terrorist organization. Expect presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden and other Democrats now to have to answer if they agree or disagree with the antifa designation. Of course, it's also possible that Trump went too far already, something some advisers are privately concerned about, and that his rhetoric could hurt him with independents and suburban women. 5 things to watch this week 1. Trump's response to unrest: How Trump responds this week to the violent demonstrations and race relations in America could be consequential. Will it be Teleprompter Trump or Twitter Trump, or both at the same time once again? Florida Rep. Val Demings, who's on the shortlist to be Joe Biden's presidential running mate, said on NBC's Meet the Press on Sunday: ""If there ever was a time we need leadership in the White House, it is now, to help heal our nation, but I don't know why I would expect this president to do something that he has never done before."" 2. The great American coronavirus experiment: It's the first day of June, and with it, many states are making continued steps into phased reopenings. April and May saw more than 100,000 people die in the U.S. from the coronavirus. Some health experts have warned that a resurgence in cases could take place if Americans don't adhere to strict social distancing, or take other precautions like wear masks. The White House has also said that cases could go down in the warmer summer months. Does that happen? And if so, do Americans get too comfortable and lapse into a false sense of security — only to see a spike in the fall? None of it's clear, but the U.S. is heading into a period of pandemic experimentation with no vaccine or cure for the coronavirus as yet. 3. Could Steve King lose? Steny Hoyer faces challenge: It's hard to believe, but there are elections on Tuesday. Two of the marquee races deal with well-known — and very different — political figures. Controversial Rep. Steve King, with a history of making racist remarks, is in a fight for his political life with state Sen. Randy Feenstra in Iowa's Republican primary. Conservative groups have lined up against King, but he can't be counted out. This district has a long history of voting for him, despite his pariah status within the party. In Maryland, Steny Hoyer, No. 2 in House Democratic leadership, is facing a primary challenge from the left in 29-year-old McKayla Wilkes, inspired by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's unlikely win in New York over Joe Crowley, a former congressional Democratic leader. Iowa, Maryland and several other states, plus Washington, D.C., hold primaries Tuesday. 4. Biden to get closer to officially clinching nomination: Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee, is on the ballot Tuesday, too. Remember, he still hasn't acquired the delegates needed to officially put him over the top for the nomination. He is 425 delegates short of doing that. With 500 at stake Tuesday, Biden needs 85% of them Tuesday to clinch. That's unlikely, so look at next week, June 9, when Georgia and West Virginia vote — with their 133 delegates up for grabs — for Biden to hit the magic number of 1,991. (Follow all the math here with the NPR delegate tracker.) 5. Origins of Trump campaign investigation to be probed: In Congress, former Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein will testify Wednesday before the Senate Judiciary Committee, which is looking into the origins of the FBI's investigation into members of the 2016 Trump campaign. The Senate is also expected to vote on nominations, including for the Treasury Department's inspector general for the pandemic response. And action is possible on changes to the Paycheck Protection Program, or PPP. Last week, the House, nearly unanimously, passed a bill that reduces the percentage of the loans that businesses have to use toward payroll and gives businesses more time to spend the money and to pay the loans back. Flashback quotation: ""When you see these thugs being thrown into the back of a paddy wagon, you just seen them thrown in, rough. I said, 'Please don't be too nice.' When you guys put somebody in the car and you're protecting their head you know, the way you put their hand over [their head]. Like, 'Don't hit their head, and they've just killed somebody, don't hit their head.' I said, 'You can take the hand away, OK?'

The protest was concentrated in central London, with hundreds taking a knee in Trafalgar Square for nine minutes, signifying the amount of time the former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin pinned Floyd to the ground. They marched along the Thames and to the U.S. Embassy, chanting ""Black lives matter"" and carrying signs with slogans such as ""Racism is a global issue,"" ""Your silence is deafening"" and ""How many more?"" According to the Metropolitan Police, 23 demonstrators were arrested in central London on Sunday. Elsewhere in the U.K., demonstrations also took place in Manchester and Cardiff. Canada In Canada, people in Toronto gathered in protest against injustice toward black people globally and against the death of Regis Korchinski-Paquet, a 29-year-old black woman who lived in Toronto, and the circumstances surrounding her death. Korchinski-Paquet fell from her balcony while police officers were responding to a domestic incident in her home. New Zealand Despite coronavirus-related restrictions on large gatherings, thousands took to the streets to protest police brutality in Auckland, sparking criticism from some political leaders. Organizers tried to encourage social distancing, The New Zealand Herald reported, but the large turnout forced demonstrators close together. Protesters marched and chanted ""No justice, no peace"" and ""Black lives matter."" Toward the end of the march, video posted on social media showed demonstrators participating in an impromptu haka, a ceremonial dance of the Maori people. after kneeling, an impromptu haka breaks out in an act of solidarity for Māori pic.twitter.com/ZijeQvzR8Z — jihee junn (@jiheejunn) June 1, 2020 Demonstrators also gathered in the smaller cities of Wellington, Christchurch and Dunedin.

It was the second time in a week that Biden left his home, following a brief Memorial Day wreath-laying ceremony at a veterans memorial in New Castle, Del. Biden has been campaigning exclusively from his house since coronavirus lockdowns began, repeatedly saying he is following stay-at-home orders issued by Delaware's governor. We are a nation in pain right now, but we must not allow this pain to destroy us.  As President, I will help lead this conversation — and more importantly, I will listen, just as I did today visiting the site of last night's protests in Wilmington. pic.twitter.com/0h2ApbKT0C — Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) May 31, 2020 As cities across the country have been overwhelmed by sometimes violent protests responding to Floyd's death — and as President Trump has stoked divisions with tweets about ""vicious dogs"" ready to respond to White House protests, labeling of Minnesota protesters as ""thugs"" and repeatedly blaming unrest on Democratic mayors and governors — Biden has tried to increase his visibility to portray a more empathetic and conciliatory approach to leadership. ""We are a nation in pain, but we must not allow this pain to destroy us,"" Biden wrote on Twitter and Facebook, alongside a picture of him on one knee, wearing a mask, speaking to a black man holding a child. ""We are a nation enraged, but we cannot allow our rage to consume us. We are a nation exhausted, but we will not allow our exhaustion to defeat us."" ""The only way to bear this pain is to turn all that anguish to purpose,"" Biden's post continued. ""And as President, I will help lead this conversation — and more importantly, I will listen, just as I did today visiting the site of last night's protests in Wilmington."" Biden's campaign posted a picture of the visit on social media but provided no additional information about how long Biden stayed at the protest site, how many people he talked to or when on Sunday he made the visit, which was not announced beforehand. While Biden and his campaign had purposely taken a low-visibility approach to the early days of the coronavirus crisis, preferring instead to keep the focus on President Trump and the daily press briefings credited with eroding the president's approval ratings, Biden has been much more responsive to Floyd's death and its aftermath, which have triggered a level of national protest not seen since the late 1960s. Biden delivered a five-minute speech from his Wilmington home Friday, framing Floyd's death as the latest example of a centuries old ""open wound"" of racism in the United States. Floyd's death, Biden said, was ""an act of brutality so elemental it did more than deny one black man in America his civil rights and human rights. It denied him of his very humanity and denied him of his life."" Earlier Friday, Biden spoke to Floyd's family on the phone. Floyd's brother, Philonise Floyd, told MSNBC on Saturday that during the call, ""I asked him could he please, please get justice for my brother."" A later call from President Trump, Floyd said, was much briefer. ""I was trying to talk to him, but he just kept, like, pushing me off,"" Floyd said. ",0.0

Still, it didn’t take long for savvy social media mavens to make the connection between banished NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who was blacklisted after taking a knee against police brutality, and Derek Chauvin, the Minneapolis cop who was fired and charged after taking a knee on a black man’s neck. The two images side by side say everything that needs to be said on the subject of social justice in America. Long before Kaepernick began his national anthem protest, black people were complaining about the weight of the white man’s boot on their necks. The rest of America thought it was a metaphor. But there it is on a 10-minute video for all the world to see: A white cop’s knee on a black man’s neck, and now the victim, George Floyd, a 46-year-old father of two, is dead. “Do you understand NOW!!??!!??” NBA legend LeBron James wrote on Instagram along with a post of a kneeling Kaepernick and the kneeling cop. “Or is it still blurred to you?” Bernice King, the daughter of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., also made reference to the two kneeling men. “If you’re unbothered or mildly bothered by the 1st knee, but outraged by the 2nd, then, in my father’s words, you’re ‘more devoted to order than to justice,'” King tweeted with the same picture James posted. “And more passionate about an anthem that supposedly symbolizes freedom than you are about a Black man’s freedom to live.” Six years ago, the dying words of Eric Garner became the rallying cry of the Black Lives Matter movement after Garner was killed in Staten Island by an officer using a banned chokehold while trying to arrest him for allegedly selling illegal cigarettes. “I can’t breathe,” was written on banners and posters and even on T-shirts worn by James and Kyrie Irving and Kevin Garnett before NBA games Who could have imagined the same words would be quoted by another black man under the weight of another abusive cop? Everybody. That’s who. “Please, please, please, I can’t breathe,” Floyd, handcuffed and not resisting, begged on Monday as the cop identified by Minneapolis police as Chauvin pressed his knee onto Floyd’s neck for at least five minutes. “My stomach hurts. My neck hurts. Please, please. I can’t breathe.” Floyd died hours later at an area hospital. Police claimed Floyd was a suspect in a forgery case at a deli and that he had resisted officers trying to arrest him. But additional surveillance video from a store nearby shows officers calmly detaining him, according to a report. Chauvin and three others involved in the arrest, Thomas Lane, Tou Thao and J. Alexander Kueng, were fired over the ugly incident, but that didn’t stop angry demonstrators from filling Minneapolis streets to protest Floyd’s death — and the police brutality responsible for it. Nor should it have. Floyd’s death was more than a fireable offense. It was murder. And the cops involved should be prosecuted. “Why is the man who killed George Floyd not in jail?” the white mayor of Minneapolis, Jacob Frey, said in a press conference Wednesday. “If you had done it, or I had done it, we would be behind bars right now.” “We are not talking about a split-second decision that was made incorrectly,” Frey said. “There’s somewhere around 300 seconds in those five minutes, every one of which the officer could have turned back … and removed his knee from George Floyd’s neck.” Floyd’s death brought back painful memories for Garner’s mother, Gwen Carr, who waited five years before the NYPD finally fired Daniel Pantaleo, the cop whose arm was around Garner’s neck when Garner said he couldn’t breathe. Carr is still waiting for the department to fire the other officers involved. “It was like my son was crying out from the grave,” Carr said of Floyd’s death. “To hear him utter the same dying declaration as my son, Eric. It’s painful but true that black lives continue to be destroyed by police officers in many communities across our country. They keep killing us, and it’s the same story again and again.” Leonard Greene is a reporter and columnist for the New York Daily News.",0.0
1622288227,2020-06-01 09:04:54,View from Away: Stop focusing on looting in Minneapolis. Be outraged that police keep killing black men,https://www.centralmaine.com/2020/06/01/view-from-away-stop-focusing-on-looting-in-minneapolis-be-outraged-that-police-keep-killing-black-men/,en,False,,29592,onlinesentinel.com,http://www.onlinesentinel.com#spider,"There is anger on the streets in Minneapolis. And Los Angeles. And Columbus and Phoenix and Denver. It is deserved anger fed by the death of George Floyd, yet another unarmed black man killed as police arrested him. Another. That’s the key word. The mature and reasoned response is, of course, to explore what went wrong on that Minneapolis street on Memorial Day. Why did the police officers responsible for this unnecessary use of force still have badges, given their history of previous complaints? Why did it take so long for authorities to arrest the officer filmed pinning Floyd to the ground with a knee on his neck? What can Minneapolis — or Los Angeles, or Ferguson, Missouri, or New York City — do to improve relations between police and the communities they serve? Cue up the commission, bring in the experts, hold some hearings, let people vent for a bit and then, by golly, we’ll have change. That’s the lie we tell ourselves with depressing regularity. The solutions we keep trotting out fail to address the real fault lines here. Police now often carry body cameras, undergo implicit bias training and embrace community policing strategies aimed at bridging the divide. We keep looking for the technology or training that can be bought and implemented to end police brutality, and there have been some improvements, particularly in cities where police departments have restricted use of force in making arrests. But progress is not victory. And this is not a technology problem, or something that can be ended with some policy tinkering. It is a function of deep structural racism that we as a nation have proved to be incapable of exorcising. Los Angeles burned in 1965 when a white California Highway Patrol officer pulled over a black motorist, starting a cascade of events that quickly released a community’s pent-up rage and frustration over police conduct. Detroit burned in 1967 after a police raid on an after-hours bar filled with African Americans similarly breached a dam holding back years of anger over police violence against black neighborhoods. Newark, N.J., burned that year too, a single arrest and beating of a black man unleashing years of community frustration. These upheavals reflected years of rising anger in African American neighborhoods over the conditions of their existence and the excesses of police departments that, as the motto says, were there to protect and to serve. Then came the 1991 police beating of Rodney King, all the proof Los Angeles needed that history does repeat itself. And no, police violence does not justify the rampages that erupted in Minneapolis. But as the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. pointed out more than a half-century ago, “a riot is the language of the unheard.” To focus on the damage and looting misses the point. Were it not for the killing of Floyd, and the history of police behavior, there would have been no protests. According to one analysis, unarmed black Americans today are five times more likely to be killed by police than unarmed white Americans. We can blame some of that on over-policing, itself often an expression of unacknowledged bias. But the threat comes not just from people with badges. It crops up in daily life in the most mundane ways: A white woman calling New York City police on a black man out bird-watching who had the gall to ask her to leash her dog. A white man — again in Minneapolis — calling security when four black men rejected his demand for identification proving that they had permission to use the gym in a building where they all worked. A Starbucks manager calling police in Philadelphia to arrest two black men who were waiting to meet a potential business partner. That’s not the police sparking a racially framed encounter; it is white Americans surfacing the structural racism that, in its worst excesses, ends with the deaths of black Americans. Trayvon Martin. Ahmaud Arbery. Their killings did not involve police. Yet it is in the intersection of structural racism and the police — the people whom we empower and arm to enforce laws — where such violence resonates with such ferocity. Floyd’s death, as Minneapolis City Councilwoman Andrea Jenkins said, “was a symbol for a knee on the neck of black America.” That knee has been there for an unconscionably long time. Too long.

I POSTED LINKS TO AL Advertisement How to talk to your children about protests and racism Share Shares Copy Link Copy Video may contain images that are offensive. Viewer discretion is advised.As cities and social media explode with anger over the killing of yet another black man at the hands of police, worried parents struggle with how to protect their children from seeing the worst of the violence while simultaneously explaining the ravages of racism.It couldn't have come at a worse time.Sheltering at home for months to avoid the deadly coronavirus, many parents stressed by juggling work and child care from home had eased their restrictions on screen time for their children.Now it's even more likely that kids might find the video of George Floyd, an unarmed and handcuffed black man in Minneapolis, gasping for breath as a white police officer pressed a knee into his neck.Even if they haven't, experts say parents should assume their children are already aware of tragedies like these and their aftermath.""Children and adolescents are experiencing the collateral consequences of the publicized murderers of Breonna Taylor, Tony McDade, and George Floyd, whether they have a smartphone in their direct possession or not,"" said California pediatrician Dr. Rhea Boyd, who teaches nationally on the relationship between structural racism, inequity and health.""Whether from social media accounts, conversations with peers or caregivers, overheard conversations, or the distress they witness in the faces of those they love, children know what is going on,"" Boyd said. ""And without the guidance and validation of their caregivers, they may be navigating their feelings alone.""Take care of you firstHow can a parent help their child traverse these disturbing times?Let the child's age and level of development guide you, experts say, but first, be sure that you are in the right frame of mind.""A parent's first step is to take care of themselves, their mental health, their emotional health. Put their oxygen mask on first before they put the oxygen mask on their child,"" said Chicago pediatrician Dr. Nia Heard-Garris, who chairs the minority health, equity and inclusion committee of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP).""Vicarious trauma through screens is real, especially for marginalized communities who may have experienced similar actions first-hand,"" said Dr. Jenny Radesky, a developmental behavioral pediatrician who teaches at the University of Michigan.The stress of watching traumatic events on television and smartphones ""lingers within our bodies and minds,"" Radesky added. She suggests parents find ways to channel that energy with positive actions, such as deep breathing and re-grounding exercises, before playing with or talking to your kids.""This doesn't mean letting go of the anger or anxiety, it just means organizing it better so you can think and act more clearly,"" she said.Once a parent is fully available to be a calm, rational voice, ""then you can parse out what's important to pass onto your child so that you're not oversharing information that may further traumatize them or make them feel insecure or unsafe,"" Heard-Garris said.Infants and toddlersWhile children younger than three aren't going to understand what is happening on television, they will be able to pick up on the ""fear, urgency, or anger in people's voices and behaviors,"" Radesky said.At this age, stress shows up in fussy or unregulated behavior. To keep that from occurring, parents should read, listen to or watch the news when the baby isn't physically there.""Watch what you need to stay informed about your community, but then turn it off and do something that makes your family feel connected and whole,"" Radesky said. ""You may need to re-ground yourself or regulate your thoughts and feelings before re-engaging with your kids.""This is the time to begin teaching your child about systemic racism and how to identify and refute it, experts say.Racist stereotypes and bias begin at a shockingly young age.As early as six months, a baby's brain can notice race-based differences, and can internalize racial bias by ages two to four, said Maryland pediatrician Dr. Jacqueline Dougé, who co-authored the AAP's statement on the impact of racism on child and adolescent health.""Learning"" racism is a lot like learning a new language for babies and toddlers, wrote Dougé and California pediatrician Dr. Ashaunta Anderson in a separate commentary. It can happen without parental input, just by the racial stereotypes so prevalent in society.By age 12, many children become set in their beliefs. That gives parents ""a decade to mold the learning process, so that it decreases racial bias and improves cultural understanding,"" they wrote.While helpful for all races, it's especially important for white children to see brown and black kids in a positive light to fight systemic racism, experts say. Books that profile multi-racial characters are an excellent way for parents to do that. And since it's never too early to read to a baby, start right away.Common Sense Media, a nonprofit that rates movies, TV shows, books, apps and other media for parents and schools, has curated a list of 80 books with diverse, multi-cultural characters for preschoolers and older, some of which could easily be suitable for babies and toddlers.""There's also a website called the Brown Bookshelf,"" said Heard-Garris. ""These are books that have, brown and black protagonists who deal at times with tough issues. I think books are really, really fundamental, especially for younger kids.""Preschool and elementary agesThis is the age when kids begin to ask questions on why other people look different than they do.""If your child asks about someone's skin tone, you might say, 'Isn't it wonderful that we are all so different!' You can even hold your arm against theirs to show the differences in skin tones in your family,"" according to Dougé and Anderson.At this age, children will see and absorb disturbing images from protests and riots literally, ""likely focusing on worrying about a burning van or a scary-looking person in a mask,"" Radesky said.Parents should do their best to limit the exposure children this age have to media, whether television, smart phones or tablets, experts say.""This can be done by setting certain times that children can use their devices, co-view the content with their children, find other activities like playing outside, games, cooking together, set rules that kids should use the devices in a common area where parents can check in,"" Dougé said.""These times also provide opportunities for parents to model the behavior they want their kids to follow by also limiting their exposure to media,"" Dougé added.But as Boyd said, children will likely have already overheard adult conversations, or been exposed to what is happening via social media accounts and conversations with friends.""Parents who have not already, should proactively engage their kids around these distressing events,"" Boyd said. ""Ask them what they know and what they've seen. Ask them how they are feeling. Validate their feelings and let them know what you are doing to keep them safe -- be it in your home or your community.""Parents will also need to give their children the broader societal context of racism in order to try to explain the rage of protestors filling the streets of cities across the nation, Radesky said.By doing so, parents can help build empathy and teach perspective-taking, rather than focusing on the child's specific fears.""Instead of focusing on questions the child may have about concrete things, ask them questions like 'How do you think those people were feeling? Do you know why they were angry? What do you do when you feel like something is unfair?' "" Radesky said.""Providing a controlled space to understand what is going on and ways to process it will help children navigate the distressing emotions, helplessness and fear they may be experiencing,"" Boyd said.Age-appropriate books that deal with discrimination and explain feelings from different perspectives are extremely helpful during this time, experts say.""You can also show them videos of peaceful protests from the past, where people were inspired to demand fair treatment,"" said Radesky, while warning that some YouTube videos can contain intense political and disinformation ads occurring before and during videos.""Just skip those and start showing your young kids the Martin Luther King Jr. or other video once the ad has passed,"" Radesky suggested. ""For older children, you can ask them what they think of different ads and whether they're trustworthy.""'The talk'For black families, there is another, more painful necessity at this age, known as ""the talk."" It's a series of ""don'ts"" black families have passed on for generations: Don't resist police. Stay away from bad places. Be respectful to white people and stay away from confrontation with white men, especially police.""We're black folks, so we don't have a choice but to talk about race and talk about racism,"" said Heard-Garris, who has a 7-year-old son. ""So he can tell you probably more eloquently than I can about racism and he's seven.""She recalls with pain when he asked her if he would be the target of police violence at the tender age of four after he heard adults talk about a recent police shooting of an unarmed black man.""He said to me, 'Are police here to help me or do they shoot me? I thought they're supposed to keep me safe. I thought they were supposed to keep us safe.' And he was four,"" she related.""And so we had a long conversation about how police are supposed to keep us safe, and I assured him that as his mom, that's my job. 'My first job is to always keep you safe,' I told him.""""As he grows, I'm going to have to have a more frank conversation that, 'Unfortunately, you're going to do all the right things, but you might not be safe."" And that's going to be a hard day for us.""The recent deaths of Breonna Taylor, an EMT who was killed in March after officers forced their way inside her home; Ahmaud Arbery, the 25-year-old unarmed black man shot while taking a jog in rural Georgia in February; and now George Floyd's death, has many black parents afraid that ""the talk"" may not be enough.""The problem here is systemic racism and disregard for black lives,"" Heard-Garris said. ""And so as a doctor, I don't just treat a patient that has a fever when they have a bacterial infection, right?""I give them antibiotics. I don't just keep giving them Tylenol because that's not going to treat the infection. And I think as a country we need to treat the illness, which is systemic racism.""As Heard-Garris's story illustrates, when to begin ""the talk"" will be unique for each child and family, Boyd said.""For some, it may be earlier than expected, because evidence indicates black children in particular are often perceived as older and less innocent than they are. For black girls, this process of adultification can begin as young as age 5, and for black boys, it can begin by age 10,"" Boyd said.""Beginning 'the talk' with school-aged children can prepare them for these encounters before they occur and equip them with tools that can be life saving,"" Boyd added.As an African-American pediatrician, Boyd discusses the topic often with parents of children in her care. She advises black parents to think of ""the talk"" as more of a process than a singular conversation.""That process may begin with introducing stories through age-appropriate books or films that can generate questions you answer together. Or it can be an ongoing dialogue that is sparked by current events. Just remember to include specific guidance that enables your child to know their rights and the steps they can take to try and stay safe. And always be sure to let your child know it isn't fair they have to learn these lessons so young. But you are teaching then to try to keep them safe,"" Boyd said.White parents can have ""the talk"" too, Boyd said.""It's an important moment to build empathy with your child,"" she said. ""It is also important to highlight the other children who may have fears or concerns related to their safety, and to model and practice 'upstanding' or acting in defense of those around them.""Tweens and teensOf course, tweens and teens will likely be seeing all the coverage of police brutality and protests on their personal smartphones. Most teens get comfort by communicating with their friends on social media, Heard-Garris said. Some teens have even begun participating in online activism.""Online activism is a coping response for some adolescents, especially right now while we're physically distant,"" Heard-Garris said. ""Reposting, retweeting, expressing how they're feeling, chatting with friends has been helpful, sort of an active kind of coping response.""Other teens, especially those that are not of a minority background, so those that are white, are educating themselves about why this is happening, what's the history of our country, what's happening right now. Intellectualizing the issues has been helpful for them to understand this is not just a today problem, this has been going on for years,'"" Heard-Garris said.At this age, kids will be able to think more abstractly about racism, injustice and violent versus peaceful protest and discuss their views with parents, experts say.""Parents can ask their tweens or teens whether they've seen anything online about the riots and protests, what they think, and what about it was upsetting or inspiring,"" Radesky said.As the parent of any teenager will attest, direct questioning of teens often doesn't produce constructive responses.""I dunno,"" is a typical reaction, so Radesky suggests parents also try asking about the types of unfairness kids see or feel in their everyday lives.Parents can also make good use of movies and documentaries that can educate older teens on the history of discrimination. Common Sense Media has lists of movies that discuss racism or inspire kids to ""change the world,"" which can be used to jump start conversations about racism and how they can help fight it, Radesky said.""You don't need to preach to children about what is 'right' or 'wrong,'"" she said. ""It's better to have a conversation where they come to their own understanding and can see things in a larger social context.""Kira Banks, a clinical psychologist whose website ""Raising Equity"" provides free videos and resources on how parents can fight racism and cultivate an open mind in themselves and their kids, suggests parents watch movies like ""13th,"" a powerful look at institutional racism in the justice system that premiered in 2016 to a standing ovation at the New York Film Festival.""Is this a teachable moment? Absolutely. It must be, it has to be,"" Banks said. ""And if a person hasn't done the work to understand the history of racism and discrimination in America, they should do so, and then join us in raising our children to see and disrupt racism, and be the change we want to see.""The work must be done by all social classes and races, experts say, including the most privileged.""White and non-black families should not shield their older children from these images,"" Radesky said. ""We need to engage our children in a conversation about racism, and use these events as a catalyst.""While it is upsetting to watch, we need to sit with that discomfort and teach our families how to channel that energy to work to dismantle the racist structures that exist in our communities.""",0.0
1622352780,2020-06-01 08:02:55,Trump briefly taken to underground bunker as protests grew outside White House,https://www.fosters.com/zz/news/20200601/trump-briefly-taken-to-underground-bunker-as-protests-grew-outside-white-house?rssfeed=true,en,False,,661135,Sanford News,http://www.fosters.com/apps/pbcs.dll/section?category=SANNEWS,"WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump was briefly moved to the White House's underground bunker Friday night to shelter in place for a brief period of time as the protest grew outside the Executive Mansion. The protests over George Floyd's death hit the nation's capital Friday night as angry protesters arrived at Pennsylvania Avenue, leading to a lockdown at the White House. Outside the White House on Friday, Secret Service could be seen after 7 p.m. taking at least one person into custody. Videos showed a large group of protesters gathering, with some burning flags and knocking over barricades. There were also some violent encounters. The president remained there about an hour before returning to the residence, according to a Republican close to the White House and an administration official who spoke to the Associated Press on the condition of anonymity. It is currently unknown whether first lady Melania Trump and their son, Barron, were with the president but the family has been shaken by the size and venom of the crowds, AP reported. ""The White House does not comment on security protocols and decisions,” said White House spokesman Judd Deere. The Secret Service said it does not discuss the means and methods of its protective operations. Officials told The New York Times, which first reported the story, they never believed Trump was in danger but took the precaution of moving him to the bunker as tensions escalated. Trump has told advisers he worries about his safety, while both privately and publicly praising the work of the Secret Service, according to the AP. Floyd, an unarmed black man, died in Minneapolis police custody this week after a white officer pinned him to the ground under his knee. His death has sparked demonstrations against police brutality and racial discrimination in cities across the United States. Trump praised the Secret Service and said he “watched every move” from inside the White House during Friday's protest and that he “couldn't have felt more safe.” ""They let the ‘protesters’ scream & rant as much as they wanted, but whenever someone got too frisky or out of line, they would quickly come down on them, hard – didn’t know what hit them,"" he said Saturday. Trump continued, ""The front line was replaced with fresh agents, like magic. Big crowd, professionally organized, but nobody came close to breaching the fence. If they had, they would have been greeted with the most vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons, I have ever seen. That’s when people would have been really badly hurt, at least."" He also claimed DC Mayor Muriel Bowser didn't allow DC police to ""get involved"" and assist Secret Service, though Secret Service later said they were on the scene. Bowser, a Democrat, said on Twitter the city's police department would protect everyone regardless of whether the mayor agreed with them. ""While he hides behind his fence afraid/alone, I stand w/ people peacefully exercising their First Amendment Right after the murder of #GeorgeFloyd & hundreds of years of institutional racism There are no vicious dogs & ominous weapons. There is just a scared man,"" she wrote. This is the same bunker Vice President Dick Cheney was brought after the September 11 attacks when authorities feared a hijacked plane hijacked was heading toward the White House. President George W. Bush, when he returned to D.C. later that evening, was later taken there after a false alarm of another plane. The recent protests have led to one of the highest alerts at the White House complex since those attacks.",0.0

More than 4,400 arrests have been made at protests nationwide since viral video emerged showing former Minneapolis Officer Derek Chauvin holding his knee to Floyd's neck for more than eight minutes on Memorial Day, resulting in Floyd's death. Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo apologized to Floyd's family Sunday, saying that firing Chauvin and the other three officers involved in the incident was the right thing to do. Peaceful protests continued to be marred by violence. The Minneapolis Department of Public safety confirmed a semi-truck drove into a group of peaceful protesters on Interstate 35. The driver of the truck was taken into custody, but not before protesters pulled him from the truck's cab. The driver was taken to the hospital with minor injuries. Elsewhere, vandalism and looting continued across the country, as did the use of tear gas and rubber bullets by police in confrontations with protesters. Reports: President Trump hustled to bunker amid Washington protests President Donald Trump was briefly moved to the White House's underground bunker Friday night to shelter in place as the protest grew outside the Executive Mansion, according to multiple outlets. The protests over George Floyd's death hit the nation's capital Friday night as angry protesters arrived at Pennsylvania Avenue, leading to a lockdown at the White House. Dozens of Secret Service agents were injured in clashes with protesters over the weekend, and videos showed a large group of protesters – some burning flags and knocking over barricades. CNN reported that the president remained in the bunker for about an hour before returning to the residence, and it is currently unknown whether the First Lady and their son, Barron, were with him. – Savannah Behrmann 2 Atlanta officers fired, accused of excessive force against protesters Atlanta officials fired two police officers and placed three on desk duty pending review over the alleged use of excessive force against protesters in a clash Saturday night. Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said she saw a video, which she called ""disturbing,"" of five officers pulling two college students out of a car downtown. Bottoms and police Chief Erika Shields made the announcement at a press conference after reviewing body-camera footage. ""We understand that our officers are working very long hours under an enormous amount of stress,"" Bottoms said. ""But we also understand that the use of excessive force is never acceptable."" – Jessica Flores At least 4,400 arrests since George Floyd's death: AP data At least 4,400 people nationwide have been arrested over days of protests since George Floyd’s death on Memorial Day, according to a tally compiled by The Associated Press. About 150 people were arrested in Minnesota after violating curfew amid protests Sunday night, the Minnesota Department of Public Safety tweeted. DPS continued to tweet about arrests late into the night and added, ""Even peaceful protesters who are breaking curfew are subject to arrest. Please go home and stay there."" DPS announced the arrests of more than 155 people Saturday night across multiple agencies. A dozen firearms were confiscated between the State Patrol and the Minneapolis Police Department. Historic St. John's Church near White House set ablaze amid DC protests As protesters gathered near the White House, flames were seen at Washington, D.C., landmark that bills itself as ""the church of the presidents."" The fire, apparently an act of arson, was in the basement of St. John's Church, across from the White House, The Washington Post reported, and was extinguished. It occurred as a demonstration was taking place outside. The gathering had attracted as many as 1,000 Sunday, who faced off against officers in riot gear. The Episcopalian church in Lafayette Square boasts on its website that every U.S. president since James Madison has attended services. Consecrated in 1816, the church also says the bell in its steeple, weighing almost 1,000 pounds, was cast in 1822 by Paul Revere's son Joseph. Illinois governor calls on National Guard to assist Chicago police Vandalism and fires were reported in several Chicago neighborhoods and some suburbs Sunday night after Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot severely restricted access to downtown following nights of violent protests. The communities of Tinley Park, Crestwood and Oak Lawn alerted residents to stay home due to civil unrest. Many businesses boarded up. Gov. J.B. Pritzker said he activated 375 Illinois National Guard soldiers to assist local law enforcement with street closures. ""This has been a scary and unsettling time, but I know we will get through this and begin the process of healing together,"" Lightfoot said in a midnight Twitter post. ""Please stay safe, and stay home."" Minneapolis police chief: George Floyd's death 'a violation of humanity' Minneapolis Police Department Chief Medaria Arradondo told CNN that George Floyd's death was ""a violation of humanity."" Speaking at the site where Floyd died after fired police officer Derek Chauvin held his knee to Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes, Arradondo apologized to Floyd's family and said he had a ""visceral"" and ""emotional"" reaction to the video that has sparked outrage across the nation. “There are absolute truths in life,"" Arradondo told CNN. ""We need air to breathe. ... I did not need days or weeks or months or processes or bureaucracies to tell me what occurred out here last Monday, it was wrong.” When asked why he fired the four officers involved in the incident that led to Floyd's death, Arradondo said: ""In my mind, this was a violation of humanity. This was a violation of the oath the majority of the men and women that put this uniform on — this goes absolutely against it. This goes contrary to what we believe in."" Protesters vandalize, set fire to police SUVs in New Jersey A group of people was captured on video destroying police SUVs in Trenton, New Jersey. In the video, the people vandalize three police vehicles, smashing windows and hitting and kicking the vehicles. One of the people opens a door to the SUV and those at the scene start lighting things inside of it on fire. Police eventually got to the scene and began pushing back protesters as the vehicles burned behind them. Minnesota AG Keith Ellison to lead prosecution of Derek Chauvin Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz announced Sunday that state Attorney General Keith Ellison will lead the prosecution in the Floyd case. Ellison called the case “unusual because of the way that Mr. Floyd was killed and who did it — at the hands of the defendant who was a Minneapolis police officer.” He said he expects to work together with Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman on the case. Ellison didn’t announce additional charges for Chauvin or charges for the three other officers involved in the incident. He added “prosecuting police officers for misconduct, including homicide and murder, is very difficult.” “Every single link in the prosecutorial chain will come under attack as we present this case to a jury or a fact finder and we need to make sure that we be absolutely prepared. We intend to be absolutely prepared.”",0.0

The vigil commemorates China’s deadly military crackdown on pro-democracy protesters in Beijing’s Tiananmen Square on June 4, 1989. The decision follows a vote by China’s ceremonial parliament to bypass Hong Kong’s legislature and enact national security legislation for the semi-autonomous territory. Democracy activists and many legal experts worry that the law could curtail free speech and opposition political activities. Throngs of people lined up on Monday at DHL courier outlets across the city, many to send documents to the U.K. to apply for or renew what is known as a British National (Overseas) passport. “My BNO passport expired in 2004, but at the time I didn’t renew it because I trusted China,” said 40-year-old Peter Chan, who works in asset management and waited in line for more than two hours. Chan said he was worried about political and security issues in Hong Kong stemming from the national security law as well as a push by the territory’s legislature to enact a bill that would make it illegal to insult the Chinese national anthem. Even though there is rising anti-immigrant and anti-Asian sentiment in the U.K., “it’s still better than Hong Kong,” he said. “In Hong Kong, you never know what will happen tomorrow,” Chan said. The police, in a letter to organizers of the candlelight vigil, said it would violate coronavirus social distancing rules that ban gatherings of more than eight people. Organizer Lee Cheuk-yan, chair of the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements of China, expressed disappointment and urged people to light candles individually and observe a moment of silence. Amnesty International said authorities should facilitate a socially distanced vigil rather than ban it. “COVID-19 must not be used as an excuse to stifle freedom of expression,” said Joshua Rosenzweig, the group’s deputy director for East and Southeast Asia. “With this ban, and a disastrous national security law looming, it is not clear if Hong Kong’s Tiananmen vigil will ever be allowed to take place again.” Hong Kong has reported five local infections of the coronavirus in the last two days, breaking a nearly two-week streak of no new cases outside of those brought in from abroad. The rush to apply for passports came after Britain said last week that it might allow holders of the document to stay in the country for a year or more. The proposal came after China’s legislature decided it would enact a national security law for Hong Kong. The move is aimed at clamping down on a pro-democracy movement that has at times resulted in violent clashes between protesters and the police. Critics say the law erodes the “one country, two systems” framework that promised Hong Kong freedoms not found in mainland China for 50 years. Protesters demonstrated against the security law at lunchtime Monday at a luxury shopping mall in the Central business district, shouting pro-democracy slogans. The British National (Overseas) passport, which was issued to Hong Kongers when it was a British colony, allows them to visit the country for an extended period but falls short of offering them citizenship rights. Currently, BNO passport holders can remain in the U.K. as visitors for six months without a visa. But Britain’s plan to allow them to stay in the U.K. for a longer period could include options that offer a path to citizenship, according to British Home Secretary Priti Patel. In Hong Kong’s eastern district of Quarry Bay, Vanessa Tai was among more than 40 people who stood in line at a DHL service point, many holding envelopes with application documents. Tai, 24, said the BNO passport is a Plan B for Hong Kongers who are worried about losing their freedoms as China strengthens its control over the city. “If I had a choice, I’d rather work and live in Hong Kong. I hadn’t considered emigrating or working overseas before this,” she said. “Nowadays, my family and I are seeking an alternative, just in case.” As of February, nearly 350,000 Hong Kong residents held BNO passports, although the U.K. government estimated that there are 2.9 million people in the city of 7.5 million who are eligible for the passport.

1622408582,2020-06-01 10:51:55,What is antifa and what does the movement want?,https://www.fosters.com/zz/news/20200601/what-is-antifa-and-what-does-movement-want?rssfeed=true,en,False,,661135,Sanford News,http://www.fosters.com/apps/pbcs.dll/section?category=SANNEWS,"Antifa — short for ""anti-fascist"" — is the name for loosely affiliated, left-leaning anti-racist groups that monitor and track the activities of local neo-Nazis. The movement has no unified structure or national leadership but has emerged in the form of local bodies nationwide, particularly on the West Coast. Some of the groups, such as the 10-year-old Rose City Antifa in Portland, the oldest antifa group in the U.S., are particularly well-organized and active online and on Facebook, while its members are individually anonymous. President Trump has singled out antifa as part of what he calls the alt-left in his initial claim that ""many sides"" were to blame for violence in Charlottesville the weekend of Aug. 12, not just the neo-Nazis, KKK and white nationalists. How is it pronounced? ""AN-tifa"" with the emphasis on the first syllable, which sounds more like ""on"" in English than ""an."" When did it start? Anti-fascist groups, particularly in Europe, have been around for many decades, notably in Italy, against Mussolini, and in Germany, against Hitler. In the postwar period, antifa groups resurged to fight neo-Nazi groups, particularly in Germany. In the U.S., the anti-fascist movements grew out of leftist politics of the late '80s, primarily under the umbrella of Anti-Racist Action. What does the movement want? The primary goal is to stop neo-Nazis and white supremacists from gaining a platform rather than to promote a specific antifa agenda. The antifa groups are decidedly anti-racist, anti-sexist and anti-homophobia, but also by and large socially leftist and anti-capitalist. How do the groups operate? Mark Bray, a lecturer and Dartmouth and author of the new book Antifa: The Antifascist Handbook, says the groups ""organize educational campaigns, build community coalitions, monitor fascists, pressure venues to cancel their events, organize self-defense trainings and physically confront the far right when necessary."" A main goal is to try to deny fascists a public forum, which is why they turn out in numbers to physically confront neo-Nazis, the KKK and white supremacists at public demonstrations. They also step in to protect counter-protesters at such events. In addition, antifa is particularly active in ""doxxing,"" or identifying neo-Nazis and like-minded individuals and disseminating that private information to the public and employers to discourage people from joining their ranks. Is antifa violent? Members pointedly do not eschew violence but rather see themselves as engaging in ""self-defense,"" protecting other protesters and primarily confronting neo-Nazis and white supremacists to deny them a platform to publicly spread their views. ""We are unapologetic about the reality that fighting fascism at points requires physical militancy,” Rose City Antifa’s Facebook page reads. “Anti-fascism is, by nature, a form of self-defense: the goal of fascism is to exterminate the vast majority of human beings.” Political activist and author Cornel West, speaking to Amy Goodman on the program Democracy Now about the clashes in Charlottesville, said antifa intervened when the ""neofascists"" move against his group of protesters. ""We would have been crushed like cockroaches if it were not for the anarchists and the anti-fascists,"" he said. Bray says the rise of fascism in the 1930s demonstrates that it was a mistake to allow such groups to air their views in hopes that public opinion would blunt their growth. ""We should be wary of those who are more distressed about alleged violations of the speech of fascists than the actual violence they perpetrate,"" he says. Where has the movement demonstrated? In addition to Charlottesville, antifa forces, who often dress in black and wear masks, have confronted or clashed with far-right groups in such places as the University of California at Berkeley, where protests by West Coast antifa forces, some of whom smashed windows and set fires, forced the cancellation of a speech by alt-right activist Milo Yiannopoulos in February and another by conservative commentator Ann Coulter in April. In June, antifa forces turned out to protest a pro-Trump free-speech in Portland. Some antifa counterprotesters began throwing objects at police, who responded with flash grenades and pepper balls, according to the The Oregonian. Antifa was also out in force in June to confront Patriot Prayer, a free speech group protesting “political correctness and hatred” at Evergreen State College in Olympia, Wash.",0.0

Wait, I get it. The nationwide calls for justice, as Floyd's death was ruled, a homicide by both the Hennepin County Medical examiner and in an independent autopsy authorized by the family. The autopsy shows that Mr Floyd had no underlying medical problem that caused or contributed to his death. Cause of death, in my opinion, is that's fix CIA due to compression of the neck. But the Hennepin County medical examiner released its summary, saying Floyd died of cardiopulmonary arrest without explaining what caused his heart to stop overnight curfews enforced in cities in at least 20 states in Washington, D. C. And many stayed out late into the night instead of going home. Protests were largely peaceful across the nation and that some marches policed even joining the people in solidarity like in Atlanta, where some officers were seen taking a knee before renewed violence. But unrest and clashes between authorities and demonstrators were on display in many cities. Police firing tear gas into this crowd of protesters in Philadelphia, sending them scrambling off the highway. In Washington, a chaotic scene as police cleared this peaceful protest outside the White House has thousands of demonstrators marched together in New York City. Others looted some of midtown Manhattan's most iconic stores. Similar scenes playing out in Los Angeles with businesses broken into. Earlier in Minneapolis, Terrence Floyd for the first time visiting the very location, his brother took his last breaths, overwhelmed with emotion before saying this to Demonstrators. If I'm not over here wiling out, I'm not over here, woman up stuff. If I'm not only messing up my community, no, what you are doing, What are you doing?

Andrew Cuomo to bring in the National Guard.Protests had resumed Tuesday during the day over the death of Floyd, a black man who died on May 25 after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed a knee on his neck even after he stopped moving and pleading for air.People marched in groups of thousands in parts of Manhattan and Brooklyn, as merchants boarded up their businesses. As the the curfew time arrived, many were still in the streets and continued marching, with officers initially standing by and allowing them.But officers started ordering people to move along, and began taking people into custody. Demonstrators who had been on the West Side Highway in lower Manhattan were herded off, with parts of the roadway blocked off behind them.“Something has to break, and it’s not going to be us,” said Evan Kutcher, one of hundreds of demonstrators who stood outside the Barclays Center chanting Floyd’s name Tuesday evening. “We’re here because something needs to change.MINNEAPOLIS — Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, who is taking over the prosecution in George Floyd's death, said Monday night that he will ""hold everyone accountable.""""I can assure you we are taking a fresh look,"" Ellison told CNN. ""We plan to hold everyone accountable who is legally culpable,"" he said, explaining that while he has spent the last 24 hours reviewing evidence, he cannot ethically comment as a prosecutor.""We are looking very carefully at holding everybody accountable who failed to do their duty and fell below the legal requirements of their position, or did something affirmatively that would be in violation of the law,"" Ellison said.""When we are ready, and that won't be long from now, we plan on taking the proper and deliberate action,"" he said.He said earlier in the day that he'd move as ""quickly and effectively"" as possible.""I need to protect this prosecution,"" he told CNN. ""I am not going to create a situation where people can say this was a rush to judgment.""On Sunday, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz announced that Ellison, the former congressman who ran for chair of the Democratic National Committee in 2017, will take the lead in the case of Floyd's killing.WASHINGTON D.C. — The U.S. Park Police is denying it used tear gas to disperse a crowd of protesters outside the White House on Monday night, saying officers instead used smoke canisters and pepper balls to aggressively push back the demonstrators.Protesters scrambled as smoke filled the streets and AP journalists witnessed people reacting to their eyes and throats becoming irritated. Journalists covering the protest reported the crowd was largely peaceful at the time; the Park Police said they were responding to protesters throwing items, including bricks and frozen water bottles at law enforcement.Justice Department officials offered a different explanation, saying officers were carrying out Attorney General William Barr’s order to expand the security perimeter outside the White House.Officers repelled the crowd nearly 30 minutes ahead of a 7 p.m. curfew in Washington. Shortly after the crowd was pushed back, President Donald Trump walked through the park where they had gathered for a photo opportunity at a nearby church.--------------Hundreds of people were gathered peacefully tonight at the base of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C. — a mix of black and white, young and old, looked out toward the Washington Monument.Several dozen uniformed guardsmen and women, along with Park Police, were standing on the steps of the monument.There were speakers and prayers and signs, calling for justice and an end to police brutality.“Together we are more,” a speaker said.On a breezy spring evening in Washington, this scene illustrates the peaceful demonstration that is starkly at odds with violent rioting and looting.“Make it quick,” one man said, “curfew is coming up in 30 minutes.”The peaceful demonstration concluded when the 7 p.m. curfew in D.C. went into effect.ATLANTA — Six Atlanta police officers are being charged with using excessive force during an arrest of two college students at a protest on Saturday night, Fulton County District Attorney Paul Howard announced Tuesday.The officers were filmed in downtown Atlanta breaking windows of a vehicle, yanking a woman out of the car and tasing a man. The two victims were later identified as college students at Spellman and Morehouse, both historically black schools, and were returning from protests calling for an end to police violence against black citizens.Arrest warrants have been issued for Lonnie Hood, Willie Sauls, Ivory Streeter, Mark Gardner, Armond Jones and Roland Claud. Some of the charges against the officers include aggravated assault of Messiah Young, aggravated assault of Taniyah Pilgrim, simple battery and criminal damage to property, Howard said.Two of the six officers, Streeter and Gardner, were terminated Sunday by Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms.CHARLESTON, W.Va. — The West Virginia National Guard is pursuing disciplinary action against a guardsman who posted on social media that he would shoot at people protesting the death of George Floyd, officials said Tuesday.The guardsman, Noah Garcelon, has already resigned his position as an officer with the Winfield Police Department after making the comments. In a series of now-deleted posts, Garcelon wrote that he would “start firing live rounds” at protesters and “see how many I can run over before my car breaks down.”Maj. Gen. James Hoyer, who leads the state’s National Guard, said officials will be taking the appropriate disciplinary action related to Garcelon and any others “who make inflammatory comments related to protests going on across the nation.”Winfield Police Department Chief Ron Arthur said Garcelon acknowledged that he made the comments and stressed that he wasn’t a racist before resigning.West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice, a Republican, has urged people to remain peaceful but said he would not hesitate to call in the National Guard if demonstrations in the state became violent.PHILADELPHIA — Joe Biden in a speech on Tuesday condemned President Donald Trump over the use of tear gas against peaceful protesters outside the White House in order to clear a park so that the president could visit a church for a photo opportunity.""The president held up the Bible at St. John's Church yesterday. I just wish he opened it every once in a while instead of just brandishing it,"" the former vice president and presumptive Democratic 2020 nominee said in Philadelphia.Characterizing the moment as a ""battle for the soul of our nation"" — an echo of Biden's central campaign theme — Biden condemned Trump's actions Monday night, which played out on live television as protesters who had been chanting with their hands in the air were suddenly scattered throughout Washington's streets.""When peaceful protestors are dispersed by the order of the president from the doorstep of the people's house, the White House — using tear gas and flash grenades — in order to stage a photo op, a photo op, at one of the most historic churches in the country or at least Washington, DC, we can be forgiven for believing that the president is more interested in power than in principle,"" Biden said.LAS VEGAS — An officer has been shot in Las Vegas and authorities are responding to another shooting as people protest the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, authorities said.The officer was shot in the area of the Las Vegas Strip and an officer was involved in a shooting in the downtown area, according to the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department.The department said both shootings were on Las Vegas Boulevard.Protesters have been rallying for days across the country over the death of Floyd, who was seen on video pleading that he couldn’t breathe with a white police officer pressing his knee into his neck for several minutes before Floyd stopped moving.Police in Las Vegas said Monday that 338 people were arrested during three nights of protests. Police said suspects were jailed despite a local court policy calling for most people accused of misdemeanors to receive court summons to prevent the spread of coronavirus.ST. LOUIS —Police say four officers were hit by gunfire after protests in St. Louis that started peacefully Monday became violent overnight, with demonstrators smashing windows and stealing items from businesses and fires burning in the downtown area.The police department tweeted early Tuesday that the officers were taken to a hospital with injuries that were not believed to be life-threatening. It was unclear who had fired the shots.The chaos in St. Louis followed continued protests Monday in Missouri over the death of George Floyd and police treatment of African Americans, with gatherings also held in Kansas City and Jefferson City.On Monday afternoon, several hundred people rallied peacefully outside the justice center in downtown St. Louis, including Mayor Lyda Krewson and St. Louis Public Safety Director Jimmie Edwards. Protestors later walked to the Gateway Arch National Park and then onto nearby Interstate 64.But later Monday, protesters gathered in front of police headquarters, where officers fired tear gas. Some protesters smashed windows at a downtown 7-11 store and stole items from inside before the building was set on fire. CICERO, Ill. — Authorities in a Chicago suburb where two people were fatally shot in unrest following George Floyd’s death are issuing fresh safety precautions Tuesday.Cicero officials cautioned residents to “stay home and stay off the streets” a day after violence and destruction erupted in the town of about 84,000 west of Chicago. Police say most of Monday’s chaos stemmed from residents trying to defend businesses. Roughly 60 people were arrested, mostly for burglary and weapons violations.Two men in their 20s were fatally shot around 6 p.m. in separate incidents related to the violent clashes.

I want you to look and the place where so many people are coming to grief. This is the intersection where George Floyd had that horrific encounter with police today. We're expecting his brother, Terrence Floyd, to come out for a prayer to lay some flowers. Theo idea is to focus on George Floyd and not on the violence. It is going to be a day of grieving and an emotional day for this community. It was another night of protest and unrest in cities across the country, with incidents of violence from New York City to Los Angeles. For the boss has been knocked down. The ones who cast that up no more because they don't have a voice anymore, all sparked by the killing of 46 year old George Floyd, who died in police custody pleading for his life as an officer. At least 40 cities have enacted nighttime curfews, and more than a dozen states have deployed the National Guard. But not all demonstrations have been violent. In Minneapolis, demonstrators gathering at the intersection with Floyd encountered police to remember the Minneapolis police chief also took a knee at the site and acknowledged Police needs to do better for community members. Need to know that the men and women that put this badge on that they're doing so in service to them and they should not, and they should not have to doubt. They should not have to doubt thean integrity and if they're gonna be treated in a compassionate and professional weight. And the police chief also saying that all four of those officers bear the same responsibility. It is, of course, a welcome message. But the protesters continue to say and continue to call for all four officers to be criminally charged. Reporting in Minneapolis, I'm Camila Bernau Back to you. Advertisement Officials see extremist groups stoking violence and disinformation during protests Share Shares Copy Link Copy U.S. officials sought to determine Sunday whether extremist groups had infiltrated police brutality protests across the country and deliberately tipped largely peaceful demonstrations toward violence — and if foreign adversaries were behind a burgeoning disinformation campaign on social media.As demonstrations spread from Minneapolis to the White House, New York City and overseas, federal law enforcement officials insisted far-left groups were stoking violence. Meanwhile, experts who track extremist groups also reported seeing evidence of the far-right at work.Investigators were also tracking online interference and looking into whether foreign agents were behind the effort. Officials have seen a surge of social media accounts with fewer than 200 followers created in the last month, a textbook sign of a disinformation effort.The accounts have posted graphic images of the protests, material on police brutality and material on the coronavirus pandemic that appeared designed to inflame tensions across the political divide, according to three administration officials. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss investigations.The investigations are an attempt to identify the network of forces behind some of the most widespread outbreak of civil unrest in the U.S. in decades. Protests erupted in dozens of cities in recent days, triggered by the death of George Floyd, who died after he was pinned at the neck by a white Minneapolis police officer. Pandemic-weary Americans were already angry — about COVID-19 deaths, lockdown orders and tens of millions of people out of work. The pandemic has hit African Americans harder than whites in the U.S., and the killings of black people by police have continued over the years even as the topic faded from the national stage. But there are signs of people with other disparate motives, including anarchist graffiti, arrests of some out-of-state protesters, and images circulating in extremist groups that suggest the involvement of outside groups.Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said Sunday that state authorities were hit with a cyber attack as law enforcement prepared to diffuse protests in Minneapolis and St. Paul, the epicenter of the unrest. He described it as a ""very sophisticated denial of service attack on all computers."" President Donald Trump, Attorney General William Bar and others have said the left-wing extremist group antifa is to blame. Short for anti-fascists, antifa is an umbrella term for far-left-leaning militant groups that resist neo-Nazis and white supremacists at demonstrations.Barr on Sunday said the FBI would use its regional joint terrorism task forces to ""identify criminal organizers,"" and Trump threatened again to name antifa a terrorist group.The Justice Department is also deploying members of the U.S. Marshals Service and agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration on Sunday to supplement National Guard troops outside the White House, a senior department official said. The official was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.The addition of the federal agents, who will have armored vehicles, came as Barr warned that prosecutors could seek to use terrorism statutes against ""violent radical agitators"" who attempt to hijack protests to cause destruction. An antifa activist group disseminated a message in a Telegram channel on Saturday that encouraged people to consider Minnesota National Guard troops ""easy targets,"" two Defense Department officials said. The message encouraged activists to steal ""kit,"" meaning the weapons and body armor used by the soldiers. The officials were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.As a result, soldiers with the Minnesota National Guard were armed during their mission at protests across the state Sunday, the officials said. The soldiers are sometimes armed but had not been since they moved into parts of the state that had been besieged by riots in the last few days. The troops do not have the authority to make arrests, and are there to act mostly as extra security for police.Others have seen evidence of right-wing extremists. J.J. MacNab, a fellow at George Washington University's Program on Extremism, has been monitoring chatter about the protests among anti-government extremists on social media platforms. She has access to dozens of private Facebook groups for followers of the loosely organized ""Boogaloo"" movement, which uses an '80s movie sequel as a code word for a second civil war.She also has been poring over images from the weekend protests and spotted some ""boogaloo bois"" in the crowds, carrying high-powered rifles and wearing tactical gear.""They want to co-opt them in order to start their war. They see themselves as being on the side of protesters and that the protesters themselves are useful in causing anarchy,"" MacNab said.She also sees signs that the Three Percenters militia movement appears to be taking an interest.Megan Squire, an Elon University computer science professor who tracks online extremism, saw images of at least four members of the far-right Proud Boys group on the periphery of a protest Saturday night in Raleigh, North Carolina.Trump was expected in the coming days to draw distinctions between the legitimate anger of peaceful protesters and the unacceptable actions of violent agitators, said a White House official who was not authorized to discuss the plans ahead of time and spoke on condition of anonymity.The Trump administration has largely remained silent on local reports that far-right protesters were also involved. Meanwhile, Democratic mayors said Trump's handling of the crisis was reminiscent of one of the darkest moments of his presidency — when he said there were ""good people on both sides"" of protests in 2017 over white supremacists demonstrating in Charlottesville, Virginia.America's racial fault lines are a perfect opportunity for foreign adversaries looking to sow discord and portray the U.S. in a negative light, according to James Ludes, director of the Pell Center for International Relations and Public Policy at Salve Regina University in Rhode Island.""This is a real issue and Americans are legitimately upset about it,"" said Ludes, who studies foreign disinformation tactics. ""That's one of the hallmarks of these campaigns. You don't create new issues, you exploit existing issues.""There's a history of this. In 2016, another black man, Philando Castile, was killed by police in a Minneapolis suburb, his death livestreamed on Facebook.Russians used a fake Black Lives Matter page to confuse and stoke anger among the protesters. There were nearly 700,000 followers, but it's not clear how many were real. One debunked example from this week: That Atlanta had deployed a ""child militia."" Floyd was accused of trying to pass a bad bill at a grocery store after he was laid off in the pandemic. Disturbing video showed him prone on the street, while a white police officer pressed his knee into Floyd's neck even as he cried he couldn't breathe. He later died. The officers have been fired; Derek Chauvin, the officer who pinned Floyd in the video, was charged with murder. At first there were peaceful demonstrations, but violence soon erupted. A Minneapolis police station was torched and protests took off around the country, growing increasingly tense. Video showed a police vehicle ramming into demonstrators in New York. Meanwhile, a van with four New York Police Department officers inside was hit with a Molotov cocktail and torched. Hundreds have been arrested nationwide and cities braced for more protests. But booking information from the county jail in Minneapolis, for example, showed that out of 59 protest-related arrests, 47 people had a home address in Minnesota, with the majority coming from the Twin Cities.Before protests began in New York City, organizers of anarchist groups began raising money for bail, recruited medical teams to deploy for violent interactions with police and planned how to target high-end stores, said John Miller, the NYPD's deputy commissioner of intelligence and counterterrorism. Scouts on bicycles would also move ahead of the groups to report where the police would be and then direct small breakaway groups to areas where they could torch police cars or throw Molotov cocktails, Miller said. The NYPD has arrested 786 people related to protests since May 28 and 1 in 7 of them were not from New York City, he said. In Washington, where protesters raged outside the White House, most of the 17 people arrested were from the area. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser said the groups seemed, at the least, organized to destroy with tools to break windows and distribute materials.",0.0

What's next for Minneapolis-area small business owners in danger of losing livelihoods?",https://www.fosters.com/zz/news/20200601/their-stores-were-burned-ransacked-and-looted-whats-next-for-minneapolis-area-small-business-owners-in-danger-of-losing-livelihoods?rssfeed=true,en,False,,661135,Sanford News,http://www.fosters.com/apps/pbcs.dll/section?category=SANNEWS,"MINNEAPOLIS — Brandy Moore likened the charred remains of her south Minneapolis clothing store and recording studio to the pangs for equality that minorities here feel. Smoke continued to waft in the air 24 hours after people protesting the death of George Floyd lit fire to Moore's storefront, and several others along Lake Street. ""My business burned down two days ago, you see the flames? It's still going,"" Moore, 41, said Sunday. ""That flame down in people's soul? It's still going. They want justice."" She is among dozens of Minneapolis and St. Paul business owners, small and large, trying to rebuild after fiery riots and demonstrations in the Twin Cities on Thursday and Friday. Her company, ""Levels,"" which also has a St. Paul location that remains undamaged, was Moore's ""baby."" Moore, a black woman, said she started the business from the trunk of her car once she left a job with Minneapolis Public Schools in 2011 to pursue her passion for fashion and music. It had been opened for five years before people broke in Friday and started a fire that destroyed her business and several adjacent stores. When she was alerted to the break-in, Moore went to Lake Street and watched nearly a decade of work collapse into the concrete. ""I'm hurt that I lost this. But ... I can't cry right now,"" she said. ""I can't go home and cry and be hurt because I lost businesses. George Floyd lost his life. He'll never be here again."" She's confident she can recover but isn't sure if she can rebuild at the same location — in the heart of a diverse southside neighborhood. A GoFundMe has been started to help with those expenses. Other small businesses face similar uncertainty, but several fundraisers have been started to help support Minneapolis' littlest companies. As looters ransacked his St. Paul store, this business owner hid in the bathroom and whispered to 911 In St. Paul's Midway neighborhood, just blocks from where Moore's second Levels location was protected by armed men standing on its porch, one business owner said he hid in his office as people ransacked, urinated in and damaged the building. Jim Segal closed Ax-Man Surplus earlier than normal Thursday afternoon because daylight looting took hold at the nearby intersection of University and Snelling avenues. After sending customers and employees home and locking the front door, Segal said he continued to work in the office of the six-decade-old company. Then he heard multiple glass windows break. ""Luckily, I have a steel door because they were trying to enter the office,"" said Segal, who bought the surplus store about 20 years ago. ""I don't think they knew anybody was in there, but I basically barricaded myself within a bathroom inside the office."" He felt as if he were in a movie, the St. Paul native said. As display cases were shattered and electronics taken from inside his store, he whispered to 911 dispatch asking for help. ""Police said, 'Don't even bother boarding up your store,'"" Segal said Saturday. ""'There's a 50/50 chance it won't be here tomorrow."" About 6:30 p.m. Thursday, he returned to the St. Paul Ax-Man location, one of three in the metro, in an unsuccessful effort to shoo away people running in and out of his store. A company agreed to board up his windows, Segal said, but left quickly after arriving, not wanting to work amongst the crowd. He tried to get a license plate of someone stealing, but others tried to take his phone so he retreated to his car. Segal sat in his vehicle for hours as rioters peed in his store and took items ranging from knick-knacks and DVDs to a snow-blower. He said coronavirus concerns forced him to close his business for the better part of two months. They'd been reopened a little more than a week when the building was ransacked. ""I don't recall ever being in a situation where I was that panicked. I was petrified, actually,"" he said. Ax-Man won't reopen for at least a week or two, and Segal fears it may close permanently because of the lack of sales during the spring. That would mean a loss of livelihood for him and about 10 employees. He sympathizes with those upset about Floyd's death in police custody on Memorial Day, describing the video of Minneapolis police officers' actions ""horrific."" ""This is just stuff, no comparison (to a person dying),"" said Segal, a white man. ""But what I'm disappointed about is the lack of leadership in the government — Mayor (Melvin) Carter, Mayor (Jacob) Frey, Gov. (Tim) Walz — to just allow lawlessness. ""Indefensible what happened to Mr. Floyd, but this doesn't make it better. And I don't know what does."" Insurance helps small business owners, but a full recovery is 'a lot more complicated' While Moore and Segal both said they are insured, they don't believe insurance alone will enough to replace everything they've lost. People typically see business owner and think ""wealth,"" Segal said. ""That's not true for me,"" he said. ""I'm the last one to get paid."" Understanding insurance policies can be difficult for many small business owners, said Allison Sharkey, executive director of the Lake Street Council, which supports local companies. Lake Street has always been an area for Minneapolis's immigrant entrepreneurs to start businesses, she said, and many of those folks may not be familiar with aid systems or insurance proceedings. ""There's a lot of detail to go through in your contract that most people don't really understand until a situation like this happens,"" Sharkey said. ""It's a lot more complicated than just paying a $500 deductible and thinking the rest is going to be covered."" Minority business owners may not have the credit or assets to withstand closures as long as white business owners with more resources, she said. The council, and other metro business associations like it, try to fill that gap and provide guidance, but insurance claims won't stop some businesses from completely fading away. For Moore, she's frustrated when people bring up the fact she's insured because it ignores the work she put into the building and the items she won't get back. ""When you get it out the mud — meaning when you get it on your own, no handouts ... someone just handing you money doesn't equate,"" she said. ""It's deeper than that."" Financial support is coming for Twin Cities small businesses left in rubble amid George Floyd protests When Segal returned to his business Friday, he found a person who lived nearby sweeping glass from the sidewalk, which raised his spirits. Monetary support has begun, too. It's especially vital, small business advocates say, because many companies were already running out of money because of closures due to COVID-19. The Lake Street Council has received over $1.5 million to help support the hundreds of businesses that line the heavily damaged area. Sharkey said companies owned by people of color and immigrants have been especially affected by the days of unrest. Several ""big, beautiful"" buildings on the southside have been replaced by rubble, which will be eventually replaced by vacant lots. ""($1.5 million) sounds like a big number, but we're gonna need a lot more government and nonprofit support,"" Sharkey said. ""We have a long road ahead of us."" She said her organization had already begun to save money to distribute to companies dealing with financial contractions from the coronavirus, but it's not been shifted to riot recovery. The council will request an aid package from the state, but Sharkey thinks they'll need federal dollars as well. ""We're headed toward a recession,"" she said. ""We're really going to have to create a long-term strategy along with stakeholders, business owners, property owners business groups, elected officials."" Donations to that fund can be made here. Fundraising has begun in Segal's area, as well. The Hamline Midway Coalition has received more than $75,000 to help aid small businesses in their recovery from property damage and lost sales. Kate Mudge, the coalition's director, said the organization has been raising funds to help small and minority business owners worried about gentrification and corporatization coming with the new U.S. soccer stadium built nearby. ""We already have been dealing with a pandemic, we've been dealing with some long-term issues in our community, and this is the icing on the cake. We hope that this is gonna bring new people to Midway, new businesses,"" she said. ""We've dealt with worse."" Donations to the Midway fund can be made at here. Despite the uncertainty, the organizations are confident many businesses will survive if community support keeps up. ""I'm not blaming people, you can't judge anybody's pain or anger. Everyone acts and reacts to things in different ways,"" Moore said. ""I have a black-owned business, it was burned down and we were protesting, for a black man's life that was taken. So, I was just a little confused on where we're going with this. But, at the end of the day, everything is about sacrifices.""",0.0

""She said, 'That's your father.'""  Both of his children who attended the Texas protest praised the peaceful demonstrations and denounced violence that has unfolded in some cities.

Mainers of all ages and races gathered at the University of Maine Sunday afternoon to promote one message that was on their minds — racial equality. On May 25, George Floyd died at the hands of ex-Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin. His death has had a ripple effect across the country including in Maine with dozens of people gathering for a peaceful protest “My roommate came with me, she stands with me. Her boyfriend came with me, they stand with me. They support what I support. They are here for me, they understand what I‘m saying and it matters to them and it matters to the people that came out today, ” University of Maine junior Patrice Roberts said. Another protester said she just wants minorities to be treated equally and fairly. “Accept me for who I am, because I‘m not going to be able to change who I am. There’s no way I can take this off and become white. I want to stand for me and stand for everybody else who doesn’t have the confidence or the power to stand for themselves,” Bangor resident Julianna Rogers said. Roberts also said there are steps that people can take past protesting to make a difference. “You have to put the effort in, you have to put the work in and call your representative. You have to do what you can with your physical person,” Roberts said. ",0.0

Most demonstrations, some attracting hundreds of people, were peaceful though violence, including the burning of police vehicles and looting, prompted police in some cities to deploy tear gas to gain control of the crowd. Early in the day, volunteers turned out in many cities to sweep up debris from businesses that had been burned, had their windows broken or were otherwise damaged Saturday. Here's a look at how protests are unfolding around the country on Sunday: Washington, D.C.: Historic St. John's Church near White House set ablaze As protesters gathered near the White House, flames were seen at the Washington, D.C., landmark that bills itself as ""the church of the presidents."" The fire, apparently an act of arson, was in the basement of St. John's Church, across from the White House, The Washington Post reported, and was extinguished. It occurred as a demonstration was taking place outside. The gathering had attracted as many as 1,000 Sunday, who faced off against officers in riot gear. The Episcopalian church in Lafayette Square boasts on its website that every U.S. president since James Madison has attended services there. Consecrated in 1816, the church also says the bell in its steeple, weighing almost 1,000 pounds, was cast in 1822 by Paul Revere's son Joseph. New York City: Protesters force closure of Manhattan Bridge; street fires, looting A crucial bridge into Manhattan was closed Sunday to make way for protesters, a day after hundreds of arrests including the mayor's daughter, it was reported. Street fires were being set and sporadic looting was reported Sunday evening after a day that saw large groups of protesters walk from Brooklyn to Manhattan over the Manhattan Bridge, which had to be closed, ABC7 in New York reported. Mayor Bill de Blasio's daughter Chiara, 25, was among 345 arrested, the station reported based on unnamed NYPD sources. The Daily Mail said it was able to confirm the arrest from a police report. She was reportedly arrested as part of a group of 100 demonstrators who refused to leave a roadway when ordered by police. Seattle: National Guard called to Bellevue; protesters block Interstate 5 National Guard troops were ordered to the Seattle suburb of Bellevue after reports of widespread looting. Washington Gov. Jay Inslee ordered 200 National Guard members to Bellevue after the mayor declared an emergency due to violence. Rioters broke into the Bellevue Mall and were stealing goods from stores. The thefts were part of a day of protests in the Seattle area that included shutting down Interstate 5, the same freeway that San Diego demonstrators blocked more than 1,000 miles away in southern California. Chicago: Gov. JB Pritzker activates National Guardsmen to assist police Vandalism reports continued to crop up in several city neighborhoods and some suburbs. The communities of Tinley Park, Crestwood and Oak Lawn alerted residents to stay home due to civil unrest. Many businesses boarded up. Gov. J.B. Pritzker said he activated 375 Illinois National Guard soldiers to assist local law enforcement with street closures. The downtown Chicago demonstrations that drew thousands started peacefully Saturday afternoon in a plaza, with protesters reading the names of black people who have died at the hands of police. But that gave way to violence and destruction that continued overnight Sunday in Chicago and elsewhere. Police used batons to beat back demonstrators as police cars were set ablaze and windows were smashed at businesses ranging from neighborhood convenience stores to high-end Michigan Avenue shops. Santa Monica, California: Unchecked looting as marchers confront police Looters took advantage of a large demonstration several blocks away to hit stores in the city's business district. In late afternoon, police were met with resistance when they tried to end a demonstration that had been peaceful. Demonstrators constructed a makeshift barricade in the middle of a street to protect themselves from non-lethal rounds fired by officers. The march had attracted hundreds along the city's main oceanfront boulevard. Though there were many police officers present for the march, looters were able to plunder stores with few to stop them. Cars were seen pulling up in front of stores, with looters running in to collect bundles of clothes and other merchandise, then running out. Boxes littered the sidewalk as thieves were seen transferring goods into plastic trash bags. A 5:30 p.m. PST curfew was announced due to the protests. The looting came despite the arrival of the National Guard troops in neighboring Los Angeles, which had seen extensive looting, vandalism and arson on Saturday. Murfreesboro, Tennessee: Brick thrown into business, police use tear gas A small but tense demonstration in Murfreesboro, Tennessee, appeared to have dispersed after demonstrators blocked traffic and threw a brick through the window of a local business, prompting police to respond with canisters of tear gas. About 50 protesters, many of whom appeared to be Middle Tennessee State University students, marched from Main Street toward Forrest Hall, a campus building named for Confederate general and Ku Klux Klan founder Nathan Bedford Forrest. Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee said protests in Murfreesboro are now “overt threats to public safety and property.” Police said an armored vehicle was vandalized and protesters have blocked traffic by lying in the street in an intersection. Officers responded by throwing canisters of tear gas to drive protesters out of the street. However, before the protest escalated, negotiations between police and protest leaders led to calm, then students and officers were seen walking together and posing for photos. – Nancy DeGennaro, Joseph Spears, Mealand Ragland-Hudgins and Brinley Hineman, Murfreesboro Daily News Journal Savannah, Georgia: Protesters chant 'Arrest the other three' during rally Thousands demonstrated against racism and the killings of black people at the hands of police Sunday in Savannah, Georgia. City leaders joined protesters who peacefully marched from Johnson Square to City Hall. “We need to make sure that we stop apologizing and we move from apology to action,” Savannah Police Chief Roy Minter said. At one point during Mayor Van Johnson’s speech, the crowd broke into a chant of “arrest the other three,” referring to other Minneapolis police officers who stood by while an officer knelt on Floyd’s neck. “Yeah, they should arrest the other three,” Johnson said. “We are tired of the mess and we want it to stop now. We stand here as a united community to say that we are standing with George Floyd and his family, because no man should ever have to die like that,” Johnson said. “We stand here united as a community to say that crooked police officers are called criminals. And in jail, they should be.” – Will Peebles, Dennis Knight, Mary Landers, Nathan Dominitz and Zach Dennis, Savannah Morning News San Diego: Police fire tear gas after being assaulted by rocks and bottles San Diego Police said they fired tear gas canisters Sunday after rocks and bottles were thrown at them. The department said in a series of tweets that the confrontation was taking place at Second Avenue and Broadway in the seaside city's downtown. ""Certain protestors continue to throw objects and vandalize our city,"" the department said in one post. ""The criminal behavior of these few is unacceptable. We are continuing to order the crowd to disperse."" Earlier, however, the department praised the peacefulness of most demonstrators. But it said it had to issue the order to disperse because of the dangerous actions of a few. At one point, demonstrators occupied Interstate 5, stopping traffic in both directions, the San Diego Union-Tribune reported. Philadelphia: Mayor Jim Kenney 'saddened and disappointed' beyond words Another day of street protests gave way to looting, with at least one police vehicle set on fire. Looters were running out of stores in the northeastern section of the city with armloads of merchandise. In the downtown, workers and volunteers swept up broken glass from windows shattered during riots the previous day. Graffiti was being removed. Mayor Jim Kenney said the mayhem “saddened and disappointed me beyond words, and I’m sure it saddened every Philadelphian who takes pride in their city.” He said those responsible “not only desecrated private businesses, they also desecrated the important message that was heard in the earlier peaceful protests.” Spartanburg, South Carolina: Passing motorists show support for protesters Chanting “No justice, no peace,” about 100 peaceful Spartanburg, South Carolina, protesters gathered at Barnet Park, drawing support from motorists who honked their car horns. “We want to take a peaceful stand to show support,” said organizer Kelvin Brown. “If we can all come together as a people, black and white, we can make a difference.” Many protesters said it wasn’t just Floyd’s death at the hand of a white police officer, or that it took days before the officer was arrested, that triggered anger. “We need to end the racist system,” said Curtis Pickens. “If you want all this to stop, real justice is what is needed. Stop the racial and social profiling. Stop hiring white supremacist officers.” “It’s time to stand up for what we believe in,” Isaiah Jordan said. “What happened to George Floyd terrorizes the whole nation. We’ve got to do something about it. I’m just sick and tired of young, black men dying."" --Bob Montgomery, GoUpstate.com Lafayette, Louisiana: Protesters want police to know 'we're human' Hundreds of protesters, some wearing protective face coverings, lined Lafayette streets to join a peaceful demonstration against police brutality. The protest, peaceful like others in Baton Rouge and New Orleans this weekend, began in the morning with protesters lining the streets to chant. “I am sick and tired of being sick and tired,” Lafayette NAACP President Marja Broussard said to protesters. “I have a message for law enforcement. The message is: we want you to know that we’re human just like you...We want you to know we have families. We’re human.” – William Taylor Potter, Lafayette Daily Advertiser Augusta, Georgia: Demonstrators chant 'No justice, no peace' Demonstrators chanted “no justice, no peace” as they walked along Washington Road in Augusta, Georgia. While “No justice, no peace,” was a popular chant among protesters, Sunday’s peaceful march was about showing strength through peace rather than through violence, organizers said. Latoya Lovett said she asked the Street Justice Council to help her organize the marches after hearing many Augusta residents talk about going to Atlanta to join protests there, which have turned violent after peaceful starts. “You can march in your own city, you can have a voice in your own city,” Lovett said. “You don’t have to go smash windows, you don’t have to go beat people, you don’t have to drop on the police.” Demonstrators were escorted by Richmond County Sheriff’s Office deputies who blocked off roads and intersections as needed. Sheriff Richard Roundtree was among those who helped guide the marchers and ensure safety for both them and the motorists. “We believe in free speech and protesting and voicing your opinion, as long as you do it in a safe manner,” Roundtree said. “As long as you’re doing that, we’re all for it.” – Will Cheney and Miguel Legoas, The Augusta Chronicle Jacksonville, Florida: Peaceful rally follows violent Saturday night of protests A peaceful demonstration was held Sunday outside the Duval County Courthouse. Then protesters started moving downtown and Jacksonville, Florida, police worked to keep them in certain areas. The cleanup of smashed store windows began Sunday around Florida after a night of unrest throughout the state’s cities. Jacksonville Sheriff Mike Williams said an unnamed deputy was either stabbed or slashed in the neck and was taken to a hospital for treatment Saturday night. A sheriff’s office spokeswoman would not comment on the deputy’s condition Sunday morning. A protest Saturday resulted in many arrests, “but we still don’t know how many or anything related to those arrests,” the sheriff said. – Sarasota News-Tribune Cincinnati: Police make 100 arrests after urging protesters to go home Police arrested as many as 100 people after using tear gas and imploring the crowd to go home ahead of a curfew. It ended a day that earlier featured a large crowd gathered at Inwood Park in Cincinnati to hear speakers as a rally, followed by a march. Organizers gave instructions about what to do if they are tear-gassed. The rally started with a fist-up salute and a song about the death Sam DuBose, shot by a police officer not far from the scene of this protest in 2015. Some Cincinnati City Council members tweeted from the rally. – Sarah Brookbank, Cincinnati Enquirer Contributing: The Associated Press",0.0

BRUNSWICK — Hundreds of people left a Black Lives Matter vigil held on the downtown Brunswick Mall Sunday night to march to the police station to protest acts of police brutality. The protest at the police station was peaceful but tense at times, as protesters demanded officers take a knee. The group stood on the lawn of the police station, chanting, “no justice, no peace.” Then they kneeled and with fists in the air, shouted over and over, “I can’t breathe.” The words were in reference to George Floyd, a black man killed a week ago as a Minneapolis police officer held Floyd down with a knee to the back of his neck. Video recorded Floyd pleading with the officer to move his knee because he couldn’t breathe. As a result, protests have broken out in cities across the country. Sunday afternoon, more than 300 protesters marched the streets of Portland and demonstrated for hours outside the Portland police station demanding to meet with Chief Frank Clark to discuss their concerns about racial bias after Floyd’s death, the Portland Press Herald reported. Toby Holton of Brunswick was one of the protesters who marched to the Brunswick police station. A black man, he urged Brunswick officers to take a knee in solidarity with protesters. “I’m asking you, from one man to another, just take a knee with me,” Holton said to Lt. Paul Hansen, who stepped forward instead and shook Holton’s hand and embraced him. Other officers followed suit, though some protesters expressed anger that police didn’t kneel. Brunswick Police Cmdr. Mark Waltz said police didn’t take a knee because that could send the wrong message. While taking a knee could mean police support the Black Lives Matter movement, it also could send the message that Brunswick officers are like the officer who kneeled on George Floyd. “I can tell you absolutely black lives matter,” Waltz said on Monday. “Absolutely we want people of every race in Brunswick to feel comfortable and safe. Again, we’re happy to meet and participate in community events. We’ll do everything we can to make people feel safe in Brunswick.” Holton said he recently was stopped by a Brunswick officer for driving through a blinking red light and said the officer was very respectful and did his job. However, he said the United States has sat and watched the pot boil until it all evaporated regarding issues of racism and social injustice. “The fires you’re seeing in these different states and the riots that you’re seeing in these different states are not the typical angry black man that people like to portray,” he said. “It’s tiredness. It’s people who are fed up, it’s people who are just done.” Brunswick Police Chief Richard Rizzo said Monday that members of the Brunswick Police Department agree with the protesters. “The killing of George Floyd disgusts all of us and embarrassed our profession,” Rizzo said. Sunny Andersen of Lisbon also joined the protest. As a white person, she said she benefits from white privilege. The system America was built on is inherently racist and needs work, she argued. “I know it goes deep,” Andersen said. “It’s not just the Brunswick Police Department, it’s not just the (Minneapolis) Police Department. It goes a lot further than that.” She doesn’t know how much the protest Sunday in Brunswick did to dismantle that injustice, but it did offer an opportunity for healing, “and I think that’s so, so incredibly important.” Rizzo thanked the protesters for keeping the protest peaceful Sunday night. He said he is willing to listen to suggestions for how the department can improve its relationship with the community and to sit down with any group to discuss how to help community members feel safer. He can be reached at (207) 721-4317 or by email at [email protected] While Waltz said no one was arrested during the protest Sunday evening, a 21-year-old woman was arrested Sunday afternoon. Waltz said police got complaints the Bowdoin College student was complaining about police brutality and was accosting motorists with profanity and walking into traffic in the area of the Maine Street, Mill Street and Mason Street intersections. Police allegedly warned her not to use profanity or walk into traffic, but Waltz said she continued to approach other people and called on other people to vandalize The Great Impasta, a restaurant on lower Maine Street. Police arrested her to diffuse the situation, Waltz said. Send questions/comments to the editors. « Previous Next » filed under:",0.0

1622482000,2020-06-01 12:10:10,George Floyd. Ahmaud Arbery. Breonna Taylor. What do we tell our children?,https://www.fosters.com/zz/news/20200601/george-floyd-ahmaud-arbery-breonna-taylor-what-do-we-tell-our-children?rssfeed=true,en,False,,661135,Sanford News,http://www.fosters.com/apps/pbcs.dll/section?category=SANNEWS,"Should we tell the children? How? Those are among the many questions parents are asking after the recent deaths of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor. Many white parents wonder whether to talk with their kids at all, while parents of color swallow their grief and fear to have ""the talk"" once again. These deaths are part of a more complex story, one some parents have been telling for generations, and others have long felt they've had the luxury to ignore. But experts in child psychology and race-based stress say these conversations are essential for all parents to have, and they underscore that there are developmentally appropriate ways to talk to children of all ages about racism and police brutality. ""Silence will not protect you or them,"" said Beverly Daniel Tatum, a psychologist and author of, Why Are All The Black Kids Sitting Together in the Cafeteria? And Other Conversations About Race. ""Avoiding the topic is not a solution."" Racism persists, experts say, because many parents avoid difficult conversations. ""One of the most important things to remember is that you may not have all the answers and that is OK,"" said Erlanger Turner, a clinical psychologist and assistant professor of psychology at Pepperdine University who studies mental health among racial communities. USA TODAY spoke with Tatum and Turner about how to talk with children about racial violence: Why is it important to talk with children about what happened to George Floyd and other incidents of police brutality or racism in the news? Beverly Daniel Tatum: Even young children may see or hear about highly publicized incidents like the George Floyd case – perhaps overhearing the TV or the radio – and may ask questions. Or if parents are upset by the news, the child may perceive the parent’s distress and ask why mom or dad is upset. In either case, an age-appropriate explanation is better than silence. Older children with Internet access may see online images on their own. Initiating an age-appropriate conversation can give children a helpful frame for understanding difficult realities. If parents are silent, children will draw their own often faulty conclusions about what is happening and why. Erlanger Turner: Many adults are hurt and angered by these events and their children may notice changes in their mood. It is helpful to have a healthy conversation around what happened and also talk about ways to cope when you witness social injustice. Does COVID-19 warrant avoiding these conversations, given many children are already struggling with fear, anxiety and uncertainty? BDT: No. Not talking about upsetting events only fuels fear, anxiety and uncertainty. Being able to talk about something with a supportive adult can reduce fear, anxiety and uncertainty. Parents may avoid the conversation because they don’t know what to say, but it is a mistake to think that their silence is helpful. ET: I don't think that anxiety and fear about COVID-19 should stop a parent from talking about police brutality. This issue has been increasing in concern over the last few years as the number of black and brown people killed by police continue to rise. I think if you do talk with your child don't leave them in a high state of worry. Make sure to end the conversation by engaging in a pleasant activity after the difficult discussion so they won't stay worried or afraid. How do parents start these conversations and how does that change depending on the age of their children? ET: I think the first place to start a conversation around racism and police brutality is with honesty. Take ownership of your feelings and be comfortable sharing those feelings with your child. Then you can begin to allow them to share what they may already know about racial differences. I think that it is always good to allow children to share their opinion and understanding before you offer information. For younger children conversations about racism should be limited to basic facts about how people are treated differently due to the color of their skin but also acknowledge that not everyone treats people differently based on race. For older teens, parents can consider exposure to news or social media posts as discussion points about this issue. BDT: Regardless of the age of the child, it is important to balance acknowledging the reality of racism, or unfairness, with messages about the possibility of change, and the community of allies who are working together to make things better. If a child of color asks if a police officer is going to kill them, what do you say? BDT: The answer will depend on the age of the child. If it is a young child, a parent can be reassuring. “No, honey, you don’t have to worry about that. Police officers don’t want to hurt you.” In response to an older child, it can be reassuring to say something like: ""I know that it is scary to think that something like that might happen, and I really don’t want you to worry about anything like that. I know that most police officers want to help people, and most police officers never fire their guns. But sometimes they do get nervous and make mistakes. So it is important for you to know what to do if a police officer ever stops you…” Black parents often refer to this as “the talk” they have to have with their adolescent sons to increase the odds they will survive an encounter with a police officer if and when they are stopped. ET: That is a tough question. Depending on the age of the child, they may have some awareness of youth that have been killed by police. Obviously you don't want to respond in a way that is going to make children be more fearful for their safety. In my opinion, I think that you should let children know that most police officers work to protect them and their community. If a child says they are afraid or angry, what do you say? BDT: Acknowledge the child’s feelings. The parent may have similar feelings. “I know it’s upsetting to hear about and see these things happening. It upsets me too when bad things like this happen. Racism is very unfair. But it makes me feel better to know there are lots of people who want to change things."" Being able to offer specific examples of community change agents would be useful. Being able to talk about what family members are doing to speak up against unfairness is especially useful. Actions always speak louder than words. ET: If a child tells you that they are angry, that is appropriate. Don't force them to hide their emotional expression. However, be sure to help them identify ways to express their anger in a healthy manner which may include journaling or exercising to release the energy from their body. If a child is afraid for one of their friends, what do you say? BDT: “I can see that you are worried about your friend. What do you think we could do that might help him or her?” Depending on the situation, this could be an opportunity to talk about what it means to be an ally, and how to stand in solidarity with another person. ET: If a child is afraid for one of their friends, talk with them about those emotions. Allow the child to express why they may be afraid and help them identify how they can check on their friend's safety to ease their anxiety or fear. Part of what increases anxiety is the fear of the unknown. If you have a plan of action it will reduce some of those fears. How can parents talk about law enforcement in a way that is honest but also doesn’t discourage children from seeking help from law enforcement when appropriate? BDT: Most police officers become police officers because they want to help people. And there are times when we would really want a police officer to help us – give some examples – if there’s been a car accident, or if someone took something that belonged to us, etc. But sometimes a police officer does something bad, like today. When that happens, we might start to think that all police officers are like that. But it’s important to remember that that is not true. ET: I think that it is very important to talk with the children about law enforcement. For example, you can talk with them about how they protect rules in society such as making sure that people don't drive too fast so they won't harm themselves or others. Providing clear examples about the ways that law enforcement helps society will allow the child to better understand. You can also be honest about situations such as police brutality and let children know that some police officers break laws. If you have a trusted officer in your community it may be good to also allow the child to talk with them in person to reduce their fear. Should these conversations be different depending on the race of the child? BDT: Children of color are likely to experience racist encounters as they get older. They need to be helped to understand their own worth and feel affirmed in their identity as young people of color despite the negative messages they may get from others. Parents of color want to raise self-confident and empowered children who are not demoralized by other people’s racism. This requires lots of conversation about racism and how to resist it in an ongoing way throughout their children’s lives. White children are often racially isolated as a consequence of segregated schools and neighborhoods, and consequently limited in their understanding of people different from themselves. White parents who want to interrupt the cycle of racism must learn to talk to their children about it and model their own anti-racist activity. ET: According to research, white parents often don't talk with their children about race or may emphasize ""not seeing color."" The concept of colorblindness or ""not seeing color"" is more harmful than helpful and does not honor an individual's identity. ... For white families, research suggests ... conversations should focus on raising anti-racist children and encouraging more friendships with children from others races. Many of these deaths garner attention because footage of it goes viral. What should we say if our child asks to see it? BDT: There are many adults who don’t want to see such footage. I would not show it to a child at all. Once an image is in your head, it is very difficult to get it out. That said, it is reasonable to describe what happened and talk about why it was wrong. It is also likely that children with Internet access can view the footage without an adult’s permission or assistance. Talking about it after the fact will help children process their feelings. ET: You should not show your children these videos as it may increase the likelihood of them experiencing symptoms of trauma or having nightmares. What we know from research on witnessing disasters is that individuals may be at a higher risk of developing post-traumatic stress disorder even through indirect exposure to these events. What do we say if, in the course of this conversation, a child says something racist? BDT: Inquire about it with curiosity, not judgment. ""I’m wondering why you said that…"" After hearing more about what the child is thinking, you can offer correction by providing new information. “You know, a lot of people might think that is true, but I don’t because….” ET: I think the first thing to do is to not get defensive. You want to foster open communication with your child. However, I think you should explore why they have that opinion, where did they learn it from, and tell them why what they said was wrong. It might be helpful for you as a parent to think about ways that you may have unconsciously expressed racist attitudes. How can parents explain the uprisings in a way that doesn’t condone violence but also doesn't minimize the sense of injustice fueling them? BDT: Children understand the concept of unfairness as well as the experience of frustration. Years and years of unfairness – racism – results in intense anger and frustration. The conversation can then be about what we must do to fix the continuing unfairness. ET: I think it is important for parents to be honest. Share your hurt, anger, or disappointment with your child. You should also talk about different ways to protest social injustice such as calling your local politicians office or even visit their office to talk with them about policy change to reduce injustice.

1622481991,2020-06-01 12:32:51,Minneapolis is trying to recover after days of George Floyd protests – one bag of garbage and one food donation at a time,https://www.fosters.com/zz/news/20200601/minneapolis-is-trying-to-recover-after-days-of-george-floyd-protests---one-bag-of-garbage-and-one-food-donation-at-time?rssfeed=true,en,False,,661135,Sanford News,http://www.fosters.com/apps/pbcs.dll/section?category=SANNEWS,"MINNEAPOLIS — At the end of a week that roiled this city of 400,000, there were people carrying brooms and garbage bags on a sunny Sunday. Jack Manderscheid, a University of Minnesota senior, exemplified the spirit of the day by meticulously walking through the Uptown neighborhood filling up four trash bags that he carried on his bicycle. “I’ve never really seen a community come together,” said Manderscheid, a native of suburban Edina who woke up Sunday intent on finding one gesture to help put the city. There have been five nights of anguished protests following the Monday death of George Floyd, a black man whose neck was knelt on for nearly nine minutes by Derek Chauvin, a white police officer. Manderscheid had attended a demonstration earlier in the week, but the fumes from tear gas used by police officers bothered him. So had the large crowds during a time when he is trying to keep his distance from people over fears of spreading the new coronavirus. He instead decided to clean the streets and sidewalks, only to find that hundreds of others had the same idea. “The longer this goes on, the more I realize I’m going to remember this the rest of my life,” Manderscheid said. Meanwhile, Dan Halvorsen picked up trash and swept away debris along with seven other members of his church in suburban Bloomington. “We wanted to perform a good deed. Our hearts are just breaking about this whole situation,” he said. “By the time we got here, the response has been so amazing, that there wasn’t a big need for us.” Other residents found a way to help by providing food, diapers and other essentials in a city where most stores and restaurants are closed. That’s how Tracy Gray Knutson found herself an unwitting, but perfectly willing, Santa Claus of sorts. Knutson, 40, sat down on a chair on the sidewalk outside a boarded-up Franklin Avenue café, planning to rest her sunburned feet. Above her, a large sign read: “Free Food and Stuff.” Residents of the south Minneapolis neighborhood surveyed the scene and decided that Knutson was in charge of a popup pantry. Soon, they descended on her with sacks of bread, beans and other groceries, plus diapers, bottled water and even more garbage bags ready to be filled. Knutson, who said she is recently homeless, enjoyed giving the goods away to a line of people who politely approached her, asking if it was really free. “Anything you want, brother. Take anything,” she implored one hesitant man. “I love you.” A few blocks away on Franklin Avenue, an east-west thoroughfare lined with stores that now sit empty, Alan Gross oversaw an impromptu food shelf that quickly resembled a warehouse. Gross, 52, jokingly called himself a barista/counselor/bouncer at two businesses that share a building: Powwow Grounds Coffee and All My Relations Gallery. The latter is a large space that typically displays American Indian art. It was shuttered in March after the COVID-19 threat forced the closure of museums and galleries in Minnesota. The art has been relocated, although Gross hopes to reopen soon. On Sunday, the floor was rapidly filling with food brought in by the carload from people eager to help. It all happened over the course of 72 hours, after word went out on Facebook that the gallery would serve as a distribution point for groceries in the neighborhood. Gross was surprised by the amount of donated food but philosophical about the motivation of his fellow Minnesotans. “Pitching in, believing that there’s a better way to do things, I think that’s the draw,” he said. “Everyone’s got to have a cause.”",0.0

She dropped to one knee, hoisting an American flag above her bowed head. Her friends and others along the sidewalk joined in, also dropping to one knee. This moment was personal for Charles, who graduated recently from Waterville Senior High School. “I am angry and I am hurt,” she said. “These are black people that look like me being killed in the streets, and the people who are doing it aren’t being held accountable.” Charles was one of the hundreds of protesters who gathered at the Universalist-Unitarian Church on Silver Street in Waterville to denounce “systemic racism,” joining the chorus of protests across the country. Several demonstrators also gathered at about 6 p.m. Monday outside the Waterville Police Department on Colby Street, where they kneeled for nine minutes to commemorate George Floyd, who died last Monday while in police custody in Minneapolis. The peaceful gathering was made especially poignant when Waterville police Chief Joseph P. Massey kneeled in solidarity with the demonstrators. The unrest locally and nationwide came after Floyd, 46, was killed by Derek Chauvin, 44, a former police officer in Minneapolis who has since been fired, arrested and charged with third-degree murder. Chauvin had his knee on Floyd’s neck for nearly nine minutes — including almost three minutes while Floyd was unresponsive, according to court documents. At the protest Monday afternoon in Waterville, Charles held a sign that read: “If you are neutral in situations of injustice, you have chosen the side of the oppressor.” “I want to protest injustices that are going on in our country,” Charles said. “It’s absolutely absurd and we need to hold these officers accountable. I know for a fact that this stuff is happening in this country, and I’m not ignorant. It’s happening every single day. The only difference now is that it’s being recorded.” The protest was organized partly by former Waterville Mayor Karen Heck. Although she has been following the news, Heck said she has not watched the footage that a bystander took, where Chauvin was shown with his knee on the back of George Floyd’s neck. “Pope Paul VI said in 1972, ‘If you want peace, work for justice,'” Heck said. “To me, that’s what we need to do to really make this country live up to its potential. As a white person, it’s our responsibility to take that work on. “I think that people of color, whether it’s African American, Native Americans or Latino, have been working at that and trying to show us how we can reach our potential as a great nation, and I think it’s time for white people to really stand up, be heard, be allies and vote for a regime change.” Heck was seen greeting protesters and handing out American flags. She made it clear that the protest was not anti-police, but, instead, anti-structural racism. A Waterville police officer could be seen giving a thumbs-up to demonstrators while driving by in a police cruiser Monday afternoon. The protest began at noon, with about 100 people lining Silver and Elm streets. Many were wearing face masks and holding signs in support of the Black Lives Matter movement. By 1 p.m., the crowd had grown to more than 200. Among the protesters were Joe and Hillary Baldinelli, who said that their daughter, Sophia, 9, asked to come with them to the protest. Joe Baldinelli said that as a former corrections officer, he was rejected from the law enforcement industry after speaking up against the injustices of some of his colleagues. “I have seen firsthand officers getting away with provocation, and they turn around and write up the individual that they provoked,” Baldinelli said. “When I pressed my concerns with it, I was blackballed from the industry because I said something about it.” The Baldinelli’s said that they have raised their daughter to not see color, but to know what inequality and injustices are and how to address them. “We have always explained it to her that skin color doesn’t matter,” Joe Baldinelli said. “People are people. Explaining inequality has been one of the most-difficult things to explain to our daughter because she doesn’t see the difference in skin color. To explain what happened, I had to tell her that a policeman killed somebody for no reason. (Floyd) was unarmed and that really bothered her, so she wanted to come with us today.” Added Sophia Baldinelli: “I think segregation shouldn’t be there. It should be about equality. (Floyd’s death) made me very mad and sad. Equality is better than segregation.” Danae Jacobson was also at the protest with her daughter, Maggie, 3. While Jacobson said she cannot explain what is happening to her other child at home, an infant, she is working to explain what is happening Maggie. “I want to stand with the black community and I don’t want to be silent,” Jacobson said. “I’m angry, I’ve had it and I’ve just been thinking of the ways that I can support and educate my kids about white privilege and racism. “We’ve talked to my 3-year-old about how some people hurt other people because of the color of their skin, and we talked about wanting to stand up for justice and to say, “No, this is not OK.” That’s why we came here today: To say that it’s not OK to hurt other people because of their skin color.” The protest lasted about an hour, ending at about 1 p.m. Drivers honked their horns in support as participants shared a few chants. Throughout the demonstration, Heck, a Democrat, was seen moving about the crowd, reminding participants they face an important decision in November. “Remember to vote,” Heck said. “And work for candidates that will bring about change.” On Sunday, more than 300 people marched the streets of Portland, while more than 35 gathered in Skowhegan.

BRUNSWICK — Hundreds of people left a Black Lives Matter vigil held on the downtown Brunswick Mall Sunday night to march to the police station to protest acts of police brutality. The protest at the police station was peaceful but tense at times, as protesters demanded officers take a knee. The group stood on the lawn of the police station, chanting, “no justice, no peace.” Then they kneeled and with fists in the air, shouted over and over, “I can’t breathe.” The words were in reference to George Floyd, a black man killed a week ago as a Minneapolis police officer held Floyd down with a knee to the back of his neck. Video recorded Floyd pleading with the officer to move his knee because he couldn’t breathe. As a result, protests have broken out in cities across the country. Sunday afternoon, more than 300 protesters marched the streets of Portland and demonstrated for hours outside the Portland police station demanding to meet with Chief Frank Clark to discuss their concerns about racial bias after Floyd’s death, the Portland Press Herald reported. Toby Holton of Brunswick was one of the protesters who marched to the Brunswick police station. A black man, he urged Brunswick officers to take a knee in solidarity with protesters. “I’m asking you, from one man to another, just take a knee with me,” Holton said to Lt. Paul Hansen, who stepped forward instead and shook Holton’s hand and embraced him. Other officers followed suit, though some protesters expressed anger that police didn’t kneel. Brunswick Police Cmdr. Mark Waltz said police didn’t take a knee because that could send the wrong message. While taking a knee could mean police support the Black Lives Matter movement, it also could send the message that Brunswick officers are like the officer who kneeled on George Floyd. “I can tell you absolutely black lives matter,” Waltz said on Monday. “Absolutely we want people of every race in Brunswick to feel comfortable and safe. Again, we’re happy to meet and participate in community events. We’ll do everything we can to make people feel safe in Brunswick.” Holton said he recently was stopped by a Brunswick officer for driving through a blinking red light and said the officer was very respectful and did his job. However, he said the United States has sat and watched the pot boil until it all evaporated regarding issues of racism and social injustice. “The fires you’re seeing in these different states and the riots that you’re seeing in these different states are not the typical angry black man that people like to portray,” he said. “It’s tiredness. It’s people who are fed up, it’s people who are just done.” Brunswick Police Chief Richard Rizzo said Monday that members of the Brunswick Police Department agree with the protesters. “The killing of George Floyd disgusts all of us and embarrassed our profession,” Rizzo said. Sunny Andersen of Lisbon also joined the protest. As a white person, she said she benefits from white privilege. The system America was built on is inherently racist and needs work, she argued. “I know it goes deep,” Andersen said. “It’s not just the Brunswick Police Department, it’s not just the (Minneapolis) Police Department. It goes a lot further than that.” She doesn’t know how much the protest Sunday in Brunswick did to dismantle that injustice, but it did offer an opportunity for healing, “and I think that’s so, so incredibly important.” Rizzo thanked the protesters for keeping the protest peaceful Sunday night. He said he is willing to listen to suggestions for how the department can improve its relationship with the community and to sit down with any group to discuss how to help community members feel safer. He can be reached at (207) 721-4317 or by email at [email protected] While Waltz said no one was arrested during the protest Sunday evening, a 21-year-old woman was arrested Sunday afternoon. Waltz said police got complaints the Bowdoin College student was complaining about police brutality and was accosting motorists with profanity and walking into traffic in the area of the Maine Street, Mill Street and Mason Street intersections. Police allegedly warned her not to use profanity or walk into traffic, but Waltz said she continued to approach other people and called on other people to vandalize The Great Impasta, a restaurant on lower Maine Street. Police arrested her to diffuse the situation, Waltz said. Send questions/comments to the editors. « Previous Next » filed under:",0.0

As a white person, it’s our responsibility to take that work on. “I think that people of color, whether it’s African American, Native Americans or Latino, have been working at that and trying to show us how we can reach our potential as a great nation, and I think it’s time for white people to really stand up, be heard, be allies and vote for a regime change.” Heck was seen greeting protesters and handing out American flags. She made it clear that the protest was not anti-police, but, instead, anti-structural racism. A Waterville police officer could be seen giving a thumbs-up to demonstrators while driving by in a police cruiser Monday afternoon. The protest began at noon, with about 100 people lining Silver and Elm streets. Many were wearing face masks and holding signs in support of the Black Lives Matter movement. By 1 p.m., the crowd had grown to more than 200. Among the protesters were Joe and Hillary Baldinelli, who said that their daughter, Sophia, 9, asked to come with them to the protest. Joe Baldinelli said that as a former corrections officer, he was rejected from the law enforcement industry after speaking up against the injustices of some of his colleagues. “I have seen firsthand officers getting away with provocation, and they turn around and write up the individual that they provoked,” Baldinelli said. “When I pressed my concerns with it, I was blackballed from the industry because I said something about it.” The Baldinelli’s said that they have raised their daughter to not see color, but to know what inequality and injustices are and how to address them. “We have always explained it to her that skin color doesn’t matter,” Joe Baldinelli said. “People are people. Explaining inequality has been one of the most-difficult things to explain to our daughter because she doesn’t see the difference in skin color. To explain what happened, I had to tell her that a policeman killed somebody for no reason. (Floyd) was unarmed and that really bothered her, so she wanted to come with us today.” Added Sophia Baldinelli: “I think segregation shouldn’t be there. It should be about equality. (Floyd’s death) made me very mad and sad. Equality is better than segregation.” Danae Jacobson was also at the protest with her daughter, Maggie, 3. While Jacobson said she cannot explain what is happening to her other child at home, an infant, she is working to explain what is happening Maggie. “I want to stand with the black community and I don’t want to be silent,” Jacobson said. “I’m angry, I’ve had it and I’ve just been thinking of the ways that I can support and educate my kids about white privilege and racism. “We’ve talked to my 3-year-old about how some people hurt other people because of the color of their skin, and we talked about wanting to stand up for justice and to say, “No, this is not OK.” That’s why we came here today: To say that it’s not OK to hurt other people because of their skin color.” The protest lasted about an hour, ending at about 1 p.m. Drivers honked their horns in support as participants shared a few chants. Throughout the demonstration, Heck, a Democrat, was seen moving about the crowd, reminding participants they face an important decision in November. “Remember to vote,” Heck said. “And work for candidates that will bring about change.” On Sunday, more than 300 people marched the streets of Portland, while more than 35 gathered in Skowhegan.

President Trump demanded the nation’s governors crack down harder on the lawlessness, telling them: “Most of you are weak.” After six straight days of unrest set off by the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis, a new routine was developing: residents waking up to neighborhoods in shambles, shopkeepers sweeping up broken glass and taking stock of ransacked stores, and police and political leaders weighing how to address the boiling anger. “We are a country that is scared,” said Sam Page, county executive in St. Louis County, Missouri, where the city of Ferguson has been synonymous with the Black Lives Matter movement since the 2014 death of Michael Brown, a black 18-year-old, during a confrontation with a white officer. “We are country that is angry. And we are a country that is holding out for the promise of justice for all.” In New York, Mayor Bill de Blasio said he was considering imposing a curfew on the nation’s biggest city after a night in which groups of people broke into Chanel, Prada and Rolex boutiques and electronics stores. At the same time, the mayor said the law-breaking in the city of 8.6 million people was being “fomented by a very small number of violent protesters. That is not what everyday community people are doing.” While many of the demonstrations around the country have been peaceful protests by racially diverse crowds, others have descended into violence, despite curfews in many cities across the U.S. and the deployment of thousands of National Guard members in at least 15 states over the past week. On Sunday, protesters hurled rocks and Molotov cocktails at police in Philadelphia, set a fire near the White House and were hit with tear gas or pepper spray in Austin, Texas, Atlanta and other cities. Seven Boston police officers were hospitalized. In some cities, thieves smashed their way into stores and ran off with as much as they could carry. Police officers and National Guard soldiers enforcing a curfew in Louisville, Kentucky, killed a man early Monday when they returned fire after someone in a large group shot at them, police said. In Indianapolis, two people were reported dead in bursts of downtown violence over the weekend, adding to deaths recorded in Detroit and Minneapolis. In hard-hit Minneapolis, thousands marching on a closed freeway Sunday were shaken when a tractor-trailer rolled into their midst. No serious injuries were reported. The driver was arrested on suspicion of assault. Floyd died last week after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee against the handcuffed black man’s neck for several minutes, pinning him to the pavement, while Floyd gasped that he could not breathe. Officer Derek Chauvin was charged with murder, but protesters are demanding the three other officers at the scene be prosecuted. All four were fired. Racial tensions around the U.S. have also been running high because of the arrest of two white men in May in the February shooting death of black jogger Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia, and after Louisville, Kentucky, police shot Breonna Taylor to death in her home in March. Even as police in some places tried to calm tensions by kneeling or marching in solidarity with protesters, officers elsewhere were accused of the very type of harsh treatment at the heart of the unrest. In Fort Lauderdale, Florida, an officer was suspended for pushing a kneeling woman to the ground during a protest. Two Atlanta officers were fired after bashing in the window of a car and using a stun gun on its two occupants. In Los Angeles over the weekend, a police SUV accelerated into several protesters in a street, knocking two people to the ground. In New York, the police commissioner said about six incidents were being investigated by the department’s internal affairs bureau, including a weekend confrontation in Brooklyn in which two police vehicles appeared to plow through a group of protesters. In another incident, an officer pointed a gun at protesters, drawing condemnation from the mayor. “I think some of the actions of the NYPD have exacerbated the anger,” New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said. “There are videos of some NYPD actions that are very disturbing. There are videos of NYPD cars driving into a crowd that are very disturbing. Pulling a mask down off a person to pepper spray them. Throwing a woman to the ground. It’s on video! It’s on video!” The upheaval has unfolded amid the gloom and economic ruin caused by the coronavirus, which has killed over 100,000 Americans and sent unemployment soaring to levels not seen since the Depression. The outbreak has claimed a disproportionate number of minority lives. The scale of the protests has rivaled the historic demonstrations of the civil rights and Vietnam War eras. At least 4,400 people have been arrested for such offenses as stealing, blocking highways and breaking curfew, according to a count compiled by The Associated Press. A bellicose Trump, in a video teleconference with the nation’s governors and law enforcement authorities, said: “You’ve got to arrest people, you have to track people, you have to put them in jail for 10 years and you’ll never see this stuff again.” The president told the governors they were making themselves “look like fools” for not calling up more National Guard members. Former Vice President Joe Biden, the Democratic presidential candidate, wrote a post online expressing empathy for those despairing about Floyd’s killing. On Monday, he met with community leaders at a black church in his hometown of Wilmington, Delaware. “The vice president came to hear from us. This is a homeboy,” said Sylvester Beaman, pastor of the Bethel AME church. Morrison reported from Minneapolis and Sedensky reported from Philadelphia.

Some police action has been directed against people smashing windows, breaking into stores and burning cars, but many find other instances more difficult to understand — like the elderly man knocked over by police as he walked with a cane on a Salt Lake City sidewalk. The protests began after the May 25 death of George Floyd, a black man who died in Minneapolis after a white police officer who is now charged with murder, Derek Chauvin, pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck for several minutes even after he stopped moving and pleading for air. Now, some are questioning whether tough police tactics against demonstrators are actually making the violence worse rather than quelling it. While the protests and subsequent police interactions may be shocking to some, many African Americans aren’t surprised because they’ve endured police brutality for decades, said Chris White, director of the Detroit Coalition Against Police Brutality, “What’s happening, it’s the way American society has always been,” White said. U.S. Rep. Joyce Beatty, who was hit by pepper spray Saturday as scuffles broke out near the end of a demonstration in Columbus, Ohio, said police escalated matters by using heavy-handed tactics against “passionate” young demonstrators who were mostly orderly. “Too much force is not the answer to this,” said Beatty, who pressed for peaceful tactics on both sides in a video posted on Twitter by Columbus City Council president Shannon Hardin, who also was pepper-sprayed. Both are African American. In Salt Lake City, a police officer shoved and knocked over an older man who was walking with a cane on a sidewalk near a protest. Another officer stepped in within seconds to assist the man, as did the officer who knocked him down. Police Chief Mike Brown issued a video Sunday saying he’d personally apologized to the man. “It was hard for me to watch what happened, and I know it was even harder for him to experience it,” Brown said. In New York, where video showed two police vehicles driving into a crowd, knocking aside demonstrators, Mayor Bill de Blasio decried what he called “structural racism” that leads to violence against minorities, but also defended police. “It is inappropriate for protesters to surround a police vehicle and threaten police officers,” he said. “That’s wrong on its face and that hasn’t happened in the history of protests in this city.” Two police officers in Atlanta were fired and three others placed on desk duty over excessive use of force during a protest incident involving two college students Saturday night. Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said Sunday that she and the police chief made the decision after reviewing body-camera footage. Footage shown on TV as captured by local reporters shows a group of police officers in riot gear and gas masks surround a car being driven by a man with a woman in the passenger seat. The officers pull the woman out and appear to use a stun gun on the man. They use zip-tie handcuffs on the woman on the ground. In a message some saw as encouraging police violence, President Donald Trump praised U.S. Secret Service officers guarding the White House amid demonstrations and said any protesters who breached its fence would face “the most vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons, I have ever seen. That’s when people would have been really badly hurt, at least.” In a letter titled “Dear America,” civil rights leader Rev. William Barber II, a pastor at Greenleaf Christian Church in Goldsboro, North Carolina, said protesters have the right to decry “brutal and inhumane” treatment at the hands of police. “What if, instead of a President who tweets ‘when the looting starts, the shooting starts,’ we had leadership that could unequivocally say, ‘When you use police power in the name of the state to murder, lynch, and destroy, you will be prosecuted for your crimes,'” Barber wrote. Trump wasn’t alone in using loaded language. The Minnesota Department of Public Safety sent a tweet Saturday saying it would strengthen its response to “a sophisticated network of urban warfare.” Hours later, video emerged of police shooting paint projectiles at people gathered on the front porch of a home after curfew in Minneapolis. “Light ’em up,” a man is heard saying before the shooting began. No one appeared seriously injured. The situation on the ground in Minneapolis & St. Paul has shifted & the response tonight will be different as a result.

Trying to understand what he sees as increasingly aggressive law enforcement tactics, Williams said police shouldn’t “antagonize, provoke or instigate” protesters. “I don’t know what’s going to happen over these next few days in this country because they want these killer cops arrested and they’re not going to stop until they are,” Williams said, referring to the lack of charges against the other three officers at the scene when Floyd’s neck was pinned under Chauvin’s knee. “People are just sick and tired of being in this predicament, where innocent life has been taken at the hands of those who were to protect and serve us. We have not been heard.” Some protesters are increasing efforts to protect themselves. On Sunday, Black Lives Matter organizers in Tampa, Florida, had nearly 100 safety marshals in fluorescent vests patrolling their march, trained in de-escalation tactics. The group also had medics and enlisted lawyers and those with legal training to watch out for protesters’ rights from the sidelines. In New York, a police labor group, the Detectives’ Endowment Association, noted some police there had been attacked and patrol cars set ablaze. “As we do everything to stop NYC from burning, all we hear from elected officials is criticism,” the group tweeted. “Maybe they should try it on the front lines.” Send questions/comments to the editors. « Previous Next »",0.0

1622552724,2020-06-01 13:20:40,Hundreds line Waterville streets to protest racism in aftermath of Minneapolis man’s death,https://www.sunjournal.com/2020/06/01/hundreds-line-waterville-streets-to-protest-racism-in-aftermath-of-minneapolis-mans-death/,en,False,,68001,sunjournal.com,http://www.sunjournal.com/#spider,"WATERVILLE — Amaryllis Charles stood on the sidewalk Monday afternoon wearing a dark-blue face mask. She dropped to one knee, hoisting an American flag above her bowed head. Her friends and others along the sidewalk joined in, also dropping to one knee. This moment was personal for Charles, who graduated recently from Waterville Senior High School. “I am angry and I am hurt,” she said. “These are black people that look like me being killed in the streets, and the people who are doing it aren’t being held accountable.” Charles was one of the hundreds of protesters who gathered at the Universalist-Unitarian Church on Silver Street in Waterville to denounce “systemic racism,” joining the chorus of protests across the country. Several demonstrators also gathered at about 6 p.m. Monday outside the Waterville Police Department on Colby Street, where they kneeled for nine minutes to commemorate George Floyd, who died last Monday while in police custody in Minneapolis. The peaceful gathering was made especially poignant when Waterville police Chief Joseph P. Massey kneeled in solidarity with the demonstrators. The unrest locally and nationwide came after Floyd, 46, was killed by Derek Chauvin, 44, a former police officer in Minneapolis who has since been fired, arrested and charged with third-degree murder. Chauvin had his knee on Floyd’s neck for nearly nine minutes — including almost three minutes while Floyd was unresponsive, according to court documents. At the protest Monday afternoon in Waterville, Charles held a sign that read: “If you are neutral in situations of injustice, you have chosen the side of the oppressor.” “I want to protest injustices that are going on in our country,” Charles said. “It’s absolutely absurd and we need to hold these officers accountable. I know for a fact that this stuff is happening in this country, and I’m not ignorant. It’s happening every single day. The only difference now is that it’s being recorded.” The protest was organized partly by former Waterville Mayor Karen Heck. Although she has been following the news, Heck said she has not watched the footage that a bystander took, where Chauvin was shown with his knee on the back of George Floyd’s neck. “Pope Paul VI said in 1972, ‘If you want peace, work for justice,'” Heck said. “To me, that’s what we need to do to really make this country live up to its potential. As a white person, it’s our responsibility to take that work on. “I think that people of color, whether it’s African American, Native Americans or Latino, have been working at that and trying to show us how we can reach our potential as a great nation, and I think it’s time for white people to really stand up, be heard, be allies and vote for a regime change.” Heck was seen greeting protesters and handing out American flags. She made it clear that the protest was not anti-police, but, instead, anti-structural racism. A Waterville police officer could be seen giving a thumbs-up to demonstrators while driving by in a police cruiser Monday afternoon. The protest began at noon, with about 100 people lining Silver and Elm streets. Many were wearing face masks and holding signs in support of the Black Lives Matter movement. By 1 p.m., the crowd had grown to more than 200. Among the protesters were Joe and Hillary Baldinelli, who said that their daughter, Sophia, 9, asked to come with them to the protest. Joe Baldinelli said that as a former corrections officer, he was rejected from the law enforcement industry after speaking up against the injustices of some of his colleagues. “I have seen firsthand officers getting away with provocation, and they turn around and write up the individual that they provoked,” Baldinelli said. “When I pressed my concerns with it, I was blackballed from the industry because I said something about it.” The Baldinelli’s said that they have raised their daughter to not see color, but to know what inequality and injustices are and how to address them. “We have always explained it to her that skin color doesn’t matter,” Joe Baldinelli said. “People are people. Explaining inequality has been one of the most-difficult things to explain to our daughter because she doesn’t see the difference in skin color. To explain what happened, I had to tell her that a policeman killed somebody for no reason. (Floyd) was unarmed and that really bothered her, so she wanted to come with us today.” Added Sophia Baldinelli: “I think segregation shouldn’t be there. It should be about equality. (Floyd’s death) made me very mad and sad. Equality is better than segregation.” Danae Jacobson was also at the protest with her daughter, Maggie, 3. While Jacobson said she cannot explain what is happening to her other child at home, an infant, she is working to explain what is happening Maggie. “I want to stand with the black community and I don’t want to be silent,” Jacobson said. “I’m angry, I’ve had it and I’ve just been thinking of the ways that I can support and educate my kids about white privilege and racism. “We’ve talked to my 3-year-old about how some people hurt other people because of the color of their skin, and we talked about wanting to stand up for justice and to say, “No, this is not OK.” That’s why we came here today: To say that it’s not OK to hurt other people because of their skin color.” The protest lasted about an hour, ending at about 1 p.m. Drivers honked their horns in support as participants shared a few chants. Throughout the demonstration, Heck, a Democrat, was seen moving about the crowd, reminding participants they face an important decision in November. “Remember to vote,” Heck said. “And work for candidates that will bring about change.” On Sunday, more than 300 people marched the streets of Portland, while more than 35 gathered in Skowhegan. « Previous Next » filed under:",0.0

President Trump demanded the nation’s governors crack down harder on the lawlessness, telling them: “Most of you are weak.” After six straight days of unrest set off by the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis, a new routine was developing: residents waking up to neighborhoods in shambles, shopkeepers sweeping up broken glass and taking stock of ransacked stores, and police and political leaders weighing how to address the boiling anger. “We are a country that is scared,” said Sam Page, county executive in St. Louis County, Missouri, where the city of Ferguson has been synonymous with the Black Lives Matter movement since the 2014 death of Michael Brown, a black 18-year-old, during a confrontation with a white officer. “We are country that is angry. And we are a country that is holding out for the promise of justice for all.” In New York, Mayor Bill de Blasio said he was considering imposing a curfew on the nation’s biggest city after a night in which groups of people broke into Chanel, Prada and Rolex boutiques and electronics stores. At the same time, the mayor said the law-breaking in the city of 8.6 million people was being “fomented by a very small number of violent protesters. That is not what everyday community people are doing.” While many of the demonstrations around the country have been peaceful protests by racially diverse crowds, others have descended into violence, despite curfews in many cities across the U.S. and the deployment of thousands of National Guard members in at least 15 states over the past week. On Sunday, protesters hurled rocks and Molotov cocktails at police in Philadelphia, set a fire near the White House and were hit with tear gas or pepper spray in Austin, Texas, Atlanta and other cities. Seven Boston police officers were hospitalized. In some cities, thieves smashed their way into stores and ran off with as much as they could carry. Police officers and National Guard soldiers enforcing a curfew in Louisville, Kentucky, killed a man early Monday when they returned fire after someone in a large group shot at them, police said. In Indianapolis, two people were reported dead in bursts of downtown violence over the weekend, adding to deaths recorded in Detroit and Minneapolis. In hard-hit Minneapolis, thousands marching on a closed freeway Sunday were shaken when a tractor-trailer rolled into their midst. No serious injuries were reported. The driver was arrested on suspicion of assault. Floyd died last week after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee against the handcuffed black man’s neck for several minutes, pinning him to the pavement, while Floyd gasped that he could not breathe. Officer Derek Chauvin was charged with murder, but protesters are demanding the three other officers at the scene be prosecuted. All four were fired. Racial tensions around the U.S. have also been running high because of the arrest of two white men in May in the February shooting death of black jogger Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia, and after Louisville, Kentucky, police shot Breonna Taylor to death in her home in March. Even as police in some places tried to calm tensions by kneeling or marching in solidarity with protesters, officers elsewhere were accused of the very type of harsh treatment at the heart of the unrest. In Fort Lauderdale, Florida, an officer was suspended for pushing a kneeling woman to the ground during a protest. Two Atlanta officers were fired after bashing in the window of a car and using a stun gun on its two occupants. In Los Angeles over the weekend, a police SUV accelerated into several protesters in a street, knocking two people to the ground. In New York, the police commissioner said about six incidents were being investigated by the department’s internal affairs bureau, including a weekend confrontation in Brooklyn in which two police vehicles appeared to plow through a group of protesters. In another incident, an officer pointed a gun at protesters, drawing condemnation from the mayor. “I think some of the actions of the NYPD have exacerbated the anger,” New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said. “There are videos of some NYPD actions that are very disturbing. There are videos of NYPD cars driving into a crowd that are very disturbing. Pulling a mask down off a person to pepper spray them. Throwing a woman to the ground. It’s on video! It’s on video!” The upheaval has unfolded amid the gloom and economic ruin caused by the coronavirus, which has killed over 100,000 Americans and sent unemployment soaring to levels not seen since the Depression. The outbreak has claimed a disproportionate number of minority lives. The scale of the protests has rivaled the historic demonstrations of the civil rights and Vietnam War eras. At least 4,400 people have been arrested for such offenses as stealing, blocking highways and breaking curfew, according to a count compiled by The Associated Press. A bellicose Trump, in a video teleconference with the nation’s governors and law enforcement authorities, said: “You’ve got to arrest people, you have to track people, you have to put them in jail for 10 years and you’ll never see this stuff again.” The president told the governors they were making themselves “look like fools” for not calling up more National Guard members. Former Vice President Joe Biden, the Democratic presidential candidate, wrote a post online expressing empathy for those despairing about Floyd’s killing. On Monday, he met with community leaders at a black church in his hometown of Wilmington, Delaware. “The vice president came to hear from us. This is a homeboy,” said Sylvester Beaman, pastor of the Bethel AME church. Morrison reported from Minneapolis and Sedensky reported from Philadelphia.

1622557132,2020-06-01 14:30:23,Use of force criticized in protests about police brutality,https://www.centralmaine.com/2020/06/01/use-of-force-criticized-in-protests-about-police-brutality/,en,False,,29592,onlinesentinel.com,http://www.onlinesentinel.com#spider,"As protests grip the nation, officers have doused crowds with pepper spray, struck protesters with batons, steered police cars into throngs, shoved demonstrators and screamed curses. Some police action has been directed against people smashing windows, breaking into stores and burning cars, but many find other instances more difficult to understand — like the elderly man knocked over by police as he walked with a cane on a Salt Lake City sidewalk. The protests began after the May 25 death of George Floyd, a black man who died in Minneapolis after a white police officer who is now charged with murder, Derek Chauvin, pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck for several minutes even after he stopped moving and pleading for air. Now, some are questioning whether tough police tactics against demonstrators are actually making the violence worse rather than quelling it. While the protests and subsequent police interactions may be shocking to some, many African Americans aren’t surprised because they’ve endured police brutality for decades, said Chris White, director of the Detroit Coalition Against Police Brutality, “What’s happening, it’s the way American society has always been,” White said. U.S. Rep. Joyce Beatty, who was hit by pepper spray Saturday as scuffles broke out near the end of a demonstration in Columbus, Ohio, said police escalated matters by using heavy-handed tactics against “passionate” young demonstrators who were mostly orderly. “Too much force is not the answer to this,” said Beatty, who pressed for peaceful tactics on both sides in a video posted on Twitter by Columbus City Council president Shannon Hardin, who also was pepper-sprayed. Both are African American. In Salt Lake City, a police officer shoved and knocked over an older man who was walking with a cane on a sidewalk near a protest. Another officer stepped in within seconds to assist the man, as did the officer who knocked him down. Police Chief Mike Brown issued a video Sunday saying he’d personally apologized to the man. “It was hard for me to watch what happened, and I know it was even harder for him to experience it,” Brown said. In New York, where video showed two police vehicles driving into a crowd, knocking aside demonstrators, Mayor Bill de Blasio decried what he called “structural racism” that leads to violence against minorities, but also defended police. “It is inappropriate for protesters to surround a police vehicle and threaten police officers,” he said. “That’s wrong on its face and that hasn’t happened in the history of protests in this city.” Two police officers in Atlanta were fired and three others placed on desk duty over excessive use of force during a protest incident involving two college students Saturday night. Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said Sunday that she and the police chief made the decision after reviewing body-camera footage. Footage shown on TV as captured by local reporters shows a group of police officers in riot gear and gas masks surround a car being driven by a man with a woman in the passenger seat. The officers pull the woman out and appear to use a stun gun on the man. They use zip-tie handcuffs on the woman on the ground. In a message some saw as encouraging police violence, President Donald Trump praised U.S. Secret Service officers guarding the White House amid demonstrations and said any protesters who breached its fence would face “the most vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons, I have ever seen. That’s when people would have been really badly hurt, at least.” In a letter titled “Dear America,” civil rights leader Rev. William Barber II, a pastor at Greenleaf Christian Church in Goldsboro, North Carolina, said protesters have the right to decry “brutal and inhumane” treatment at the hands of police. “What if, instead of a President who tweets ‘when the looting starts, the shooting starts,’ we had leadership that could unequivocally say, ‘When you use police power in the name of the state to murder, lynch, and destroy, you will be prosecuted for your crimes,'” Barber wrote. Trump wasn’t alone in using loaded language. The Minnesota Department of Public Safety sent a tweet Saturday saying it would strengthen its response to “a sophisticated network of urban warfare.” Hours later, video emerged of police shooting paint projectiles at people gathered on the front porch of a home after curfew in Minneapolis. “Light ’em up,” a man is heard saying before the shooting began. No one appeared seriously injured. The situation on the ground in Minneapolis & St. Paul has shifted & the response tonight will be different as a result. The coordinated @MNNationalGuard, @MnDPS_MSP, & law enforcement presence will triple in size to address a sophisticated network of urban warfare. #MACCMN — MnDPS_DPS (@MnDPS_DPS) May 30, 2020 Activist Meeko Williams organized a peaceful demonstration in Detroit on Friday and later traveled to Minnesota to help support organizers there. Trying to understand what he sees as increasingly aggressive law enforcement tactics, Williams said police shouldn’t “antagonize, provoke or instigate” protesters. “I don’t know what’s going to happen over these next few days in this country because they want these killer cops arrested and they’re not going to stop until they are,” Williams said, referring to the lack of charges against the other three officers at the scene when Floyd’s neck was pinned under Chauvin’s knee. “People are just sick and tired of being in this predicament, where innocent life has been taken at the hands of those who were to protect and serve us. We have not been heard.” Some protesters are increasing efforts to protect themselves. On Sunday, Black Lives Matter organizers in Tampa, Florida, had nearly 100 safety marshals in fluorescent vests patrolling their march, trained in de-escalation tactics. The group also had medics and enlisted lawyers and those with legal training to watch out for protesters’ rights from the sidelines. In New York, a police labor group, the Detectives’ Endowment Association, noted some police there had been attacked and patrol cars set ablaze. “As we do everything to stop NYC from burning, all we hear from elected officials is criticism,” the group tweeted. “Maybe they should try it on the front lines.” Send questions/comments to the editors. « Previous Next »",0.0

That gathering — the second protest in Belfast that day — was followed by a “civil disobedience” event: protesters marched down Main Street to the waterfront, with some in the group walking back up the hill to block the intersection of Main and High streets. At that intersection, protesters said a man tried to drive his car into the group at low speed, but no injuries were reported. It was one of many protests held across the nation and beyond after the death of George Floyd, a black man who died after he was pinned at the neck by a white Minneapolis police officer who has been charged with murder. “We occupied the intersection for a little bit, just to make a statement. We wanted our police department to release a statement about the death of George Floyd. We were trying to get their attention. What can we do? Stop traffic,” said organizer Syd Sanders, the 18-year-old valedictorian of Belfast Area High School. “The cops did show up. It was all peaceful. No one was doing anything violent … It was just a peaceful protest, with some peaceful civil disobedience. It worked, and I’m thrilled.” Courtesy of Judy Berk Courtesy of Judy Berk Belfast Police Chief Gerry Lincoln released a statement Monday in response to the protest, which he described as having begun “very peaceably” and with only a few “disrespectful” participants. “The Belfast Police Department has no place for racism in its ranks, will not tolerate it in any form, and firmly believes all people deserve to be treated equally,” he said. “The tragic events in Minneapolis cause us all to reflect upon our own procedures and training to be sure when action is taken, it is done properly, justly, and equitably in all situations.” Not everyone in Belfast was pleased, of course, with the protesters’ decision to block the intersection. On Monday, the “You Know You Love Belfast” Facebook group blew up with comments about the protest, with people both criticizing and defending it. Some who witnessed the protest, but did not participate in it, said they felt unnerved or angered by the chanting, yelling, road-blocking and other behavior of the protesters, and pointed out that they did not have a permit to march on the streets. Others mentioned a profane sign that one of the young men held up, that children dining at Main Street restaurants might have seen. Deputy Chief Dean Jackson of the Belfast Police Department was skeptical of claims that protesters vandalized city property, saying that he was aware only of a parking sign that had its chain broken. He also said that he had heard a report Monday morning about the man who allegedly tried to drive into the group of protesters, but that he wasn’t aware of any injuries. “The bottom line is, it ended peacefully. There was no major vandalism,” he said. But Raymelle Moody, who attended the protest, said that she witnessed disturbing behavior on the part of bystanders. People in two vehicles “shouted expletives” and made lewd gestures at the protesters, she said, and then another person at the intersection of Main and High who was frustrated by traffic being blocked. “[They] decided they were going to drive their car directly into this group of teenagers,” she said. “I was standing right there. I was very surprised that no one got hurt.” Those events, and the often-angry responses to the protest on social media, to her, demonstrates that racism is alive in Maine. “I am outraged by the continuing systematic racism that goes on in our country,” Moody said. “We’ve been quiet for far too long. It is us, the privileged, who need to raise our voices and stand up for these people. That is what will result in actual change.” But Shawna Aitkin, who was in the car that went into the crowd, said Monday that she and her companions drove up to the protesters hoping they’d be allowed to pass through. Instead, they were surrounded and shouted at for a minute or so before they were able to drive around them and up the street. “I literally felt threatened and could not stop shaking,” she wrote the BDN. “They were out for a riot [and] looking for someone to give them a reason to riot.” Kayleigh Bernier, 20, of Camden, said that taking part in the protest was a powerful experience for her. She noticed the tension between some of the bystanders and the protesters, and also saw the driver “trying to just drive through the protesters.” “Eventually we had no choice but to get out of the way,” she said. “There were definitely a couple of people not happy about the event. But I feel very strongly about racial injustice, and I know a lot of other people do, too. We weren’t going to stop just because there were hecklers.” ...",0.0

Several top record labels organized Black Out Tuesday as violent protests erupted around the world sparked by Floyd’s death as well as the killings of Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor. Music-based companies Live Nation and TikTok, as well as the Recording Academy, posted to social media that it planned to support and stand with the black community. “On Tuesday June 2nd, Columbia Records will observe ‘Black Out Tuesday,’” the Sony label home to Beyoncé, Bob Dylan, Adele and John Legend said in a statement. “This is not a day off. Instead, this is a day to reflect and figure out ways to move forward in solidarity.” “We continue to stand with the Black community, our staff, artists, and peers in the music industry,” the company continued. “Perhaps with the music off, we can truly listen.” Others that have joined Black Out Tuesday include the Sony imprints RCA Records and Epic Records; the Universal Music Group divisions Republic Records, Def Jam, UMG Nashville, Capitol Records and Island Records; and the Warner Music Group imprints Atlantic and Warner Records. Smaller, independent labels as well as music publishing companies and management firms have also signed on. UMG’s Interscope Geffen A&M said that in addition to joining Black Out Tuesday, the label home to Lady Gaga and Kendrick Lamar would not release music this week — the first label to do so. “Instead, IGA will contribute to organizations that help to bail out protesters exercising their right to peacefully assemble, aid lawyers working for systemic change and provide assistance to charities focused on creating economic empowerment in the Black community,” its statement read. IGA postponed new music releases MGK, 6lack, Dylan, Jessie Ware, Smokepurp, Lil Mosey, Billy Raffoul, Max Leone and more in coordination with their partners Alamo, LVRN, The Darkroom, Bad Boy and more. Musicians including Rihanna, Beyoncé, Taylor Swift, Lil Nas X, Demi Lovato, Post Malone and Harry Styles have spoken out following Floyd’s death and worldwide protests. Jay-Z released a statement late Sunday calling for Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison to prosecute those responsible for killing Floyd, a handcuffed black man who pleaded for air as a white police officer pressed a knee on his neck. “I, along with an entire country in pain, call upon AG Ellison to do the right thing and prosecute all those responsible for the murder of George Floyd to the fullest extent of the law. This is just a first step. I am more determined to fight for justice than any fight my would-be oppressors may have,” Jay-Z said. “I prevail on every politician, prosecutor and officer in the country to have the courage to do what is right. Have the courage to look at us as humans, dads, brothers, sisters and mothers in pain and look at yourselves.” Racial tensions were also running high after two white men were arrested in May in the February shooting death of black jogger Arbery in Georgia, and after Louisville, Kentucky, police shot Taylor to death in her home in March. The R&B duo Chloe x Halle, who will release their sophomore album “Ungodly Hour” on Friday, posted a cover of the classic civil rights anthem and protest song “We Shall Overcome” to Instagram. “This week has been very heavy for all of us. We’ve been trying to, not understand, because there’s no way to understand the terrible killings — we just have heavy hearts this week and are just trying to do everything we can to pray and lift each other up with our voices,” Halle said in an interview with The Associated Press. “With everything going on, we felt like music can be very healing, because it’s been that way for us in kind of keeping us sane during this time,” Chloe added. As much as we could, we just wanted to share our gift of song to even just lift spirits for even a few seconds.” Send questions/comments to the editors. « Previous Next »",0.0

Health experts fear carriers of coronavirus, which causes the disease, with no symptoms could unwittingly infect others at protests where social distancing is simply not taking place. The merits of the protesters' cause ""doesn’t prevent them from getting the virus,” said Bradley Pollock, chairman of the Department of Public Health Sciences at the University of California, Davis. At least one protester in Tampa, Florida, is known to have COVID-19. Tampa Police Chief Brian Dugan, who expressed dismay last week about Floyd's death, tweeted Monday that five of his officers were exposed to the protester, whom he did not identify. Protesting – especially without a mask – can put people at higher risk for infection, said Dr. Michael Mina, an assistant professor of epidemiology at Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health. ""There's no doubt in my mind that these can become breeding grounds for this virus,"" he said during a Monday media availability. ""I would not be surprised to see in the next couple of weeks that we see increases that may be linked to protests."" Viral photos: A photo page of striking moments from the week’s protests. As businesses re-open, it will be difficult to figure out whether someone caught the virus at a protest or in some other encounter, Mina said. Hopefully, the fact that protests are taking place out of doors, will dilute the virus and reduce disease transmission, he said. Wearing a mask will help reduce infections, though it won't completely eliminate risk. ""If there's a floridly positive person who is coughing and spending a whole day around a lot of other people, that person might very well get other people sick despite having a mask on,"" Mina added, but ""there's a good chance that even homemade masks will actually do quite a bit to help people not get infected and not transmit."" There is historical precedent to suggest that viruses can be spread by large public gatherings. In September 1918, people in Philadelphia held a parade to celebrate the return of soldiers from World War I. The gathering of 200,000 people, crammed shoulder to shoulder, reignited a deadly flu epidemic, leading to massive closures and thousands of deaths, records show. Yet, there's a public health cost to not protesting the status quo, said Dr. Hillary Babcock, an infectious disease specialist at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, and immediate past president of the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America. ""Systemic racism also causes large public health impacts and public health risks for large portions of our population,"" Babcock said. She disagreed with calls for protesters to stay home to avoid fueling the outbreak. ""I don't think using public health as a reason to discourage protests after these events is really appropriate,"" Babcock said. ""It's a little disingenuous to say that the health risk from protesting is somehow bigger than the health risk at Lake of Ozarks (where people gathered for fun over Memorial Day weekend) or the practices that brought us to this point in the first place."" At least one reveler at the lake party tested positive for COVID-19, according to the Camden County Health Department. Others were advised to monitor for symptoms. Babcock said it is possible to minimize the risks of protesting, with masks, social distancing and asking sick people to stay home. Arresting people and putting them into close contact with others increases risk, Babcock said, as does spraying protesters with pepper spray, which causes violent coughing and can potentially spread the virus. Timeline: George Floyd protests: How did we get here? Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency room physician and former Baltimore health commissioner, said there is risk of longer-term effects in communities disproportionately affected by COVID-19. Wen was Baltimore's health commissioner when protests erupted following the 2015 death of Freddie Gray. The death triggered civil unrest in communities already burdened with deep-seated inequities, she said. ""When over a dozen pharmacies burned down and closed and stores were looted, it was community members themselves who were affected the most,"" Wen said. While protests over the past week following Floyd's death have highlighted police-community relations, demonstrators are also calling attention to social justice issues, including health disparities. ""The same communities that are already the most affected are potentially going to have an increase in the number of cases as a result of people gathering,"" Wen said. Melanie Campbell, president of the National Coalition on Black Civic Participation, said anger in the black community has been building for years. Floyd's death spurred them to take to the streets, even as the coronavirus has taken a disproportionate toll on African Americans. ""Black people are risking their lives protesting in the middle of a pandemic that’s killing black folks. That’s real,"" she said. ""There is no convenient time to fight back."" Meanwhile, state and local public health agencies plan to monitor for new COVID-19 cases. Any large gathering during a pandemic is a concern, said John C. Welch, director of partnerships and operations for the Massachusetts Covid Response project. Partners in Health, a Boston-based nonprofit, handles Massachusetts’ contact tracing of individuals infected with or exposed to the virus. Following such a large gathering, potential cases need to be monitored over two weeks, the virus’s incubation period. “The epidemic curve should guide the response and the phased reopening of society,"" Welch said. ""Until the epidemic is declared over, social distancing and wearing masks should remain the new normal."" Peter Pitts, president and co-founder of the Center for Medicine in the Public Interest, a nonpartisan research and educational organization, said he worries COVID-19 will take advantage of people gathering to protest police violence. ""Social distancing and social conflict are a very potent negative combination when it comes to spreading a virus,"" he said. ""The timing is highly unfortunate."" Public health concerns, which are usually complicated, can easily be drowned out by other ""sexier"" stories, he said, citing the recent SpaceX launch. But the virus ""doesn't cease to be a real threat because of other threats happening simultaneously,"" he said. ""That means we have to twice as smart and twice as dedicated and twice as focused.""

The callous manner in which this arrest was carried out is reprehensible."" Now-former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin has been charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter following the fatal arrest of Floyd on May 25. A video recorded by a bystander showed Chauvin kneeling on Floyd’s neck for nearly nine minutes, as other officers stood idly by. ""I want to express my heartfelt sympathy to the family, friends and loved ones of George Floyd,"" Merner said. ""We as a police agency are deeply disturbed by what we saw on that video."" Merner said both the ""actions and inactions"" of the Minneapolis police officers recorded on video ""jeopardize the gains that have been made throughout the policing profession in our country."" Floyd’s death should be of concern ""to not only all police officers and agencies but all Americans,"" he said. ""The officers' actions are totally inconsistent with the training and protocols of our profession."" Merner continued, ""The men and women of the Portsmouth Police Department will continue to work with the community to enhance the opportunity to build the trust that is tantamount in modern day policing."" In Dover, Police Chief William Breault penned an lengthy open letter to the community on Monday. His remarks came ahead of a planned peaceful protest at Henry Law Park later that night, organized by DREAM students at Dover High School. ""As your police chief, I want to reassure you that the women and men of the Dover Police Department remain steadfast in protecting the constitutional rights of everyone,"" Breault said. ""Now more than ever, as we move through these events together, I call on all community members to demonstrate respect and compassion for one another."" Breault said he is ""outraged and saddened"" by police actions in Minneapolis. Though occurring many states away, he said, the incident has ""eroded the very same public trust we have worked so hard to achieve."" ""What we saw occur in Minneapolis is not only completely against the mission, vision, and values of the Dover Police Department, but also the training, tactics, and professionalism with which our officers serve the community each and every day,"" he said. Breault said Dover officers receive the ""best and most current training available,"" demonstrating daily de-escalation and sound judgment. ""Please know that we as law enforcement professionals stand with you, feeling the same pain, anger, and frustration,"" said Breault. ""Let us all work together to make positive change and focus on keeping Dover a safe and peaceful place for everyone."" On Saturday, Gov. Chris Sununu issued a public statement after a Black Lives Matter protest on Elm Street in Manchester drew hundreds of people. ""This morning I called the organizers ahead of the George Floyd March in Manchester to let them know the state of New Hampshire stands with them in their calls for justice,"" said Sununu. ""This important conversation must continue and we must constructively work together as a nation to ensure there is change."" On Monday, Sununu said he has been in regular contact with New Hampshire State Police, local police departments and the National Guard ""to ensure New Hampshire remains safe."" He said the state will not condone violence against individuals, small businesses, or public property. ""Racism has no home and will not be tolerated in New Hampshire,"" Sunuu said. ""And neither does violence, looting or rioting.""",0.0
1622628467,2020-06-01 16:26:20,Facebook employees speak out against company over Trump,https://www.pressherald.com/2020/06/01/facebook-employees-speak-out-against-company-over-trump/,en,False,,366984,pressherald.com,http://pressherald.com/,"OAKLAND, Calif. — Facebook employees are using Twitter to register their frustration over CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s decision to leave up posts by President Trump that suggested protesters in Minneapolis could be shot. While Twitter demoted and placed a warning on a tweet about the protests that read, in part, that “when the looting starts the shooting starts,” Facebook has let it stand, with Zuckerberg laying out his reasoning in a Facebook post Friday. “I know many people are upset that we’ve left the President’s posts up, but our position is that we should enable as much expression as possible unless it will cause imminent risk of specific harms or dangers spelled out in clear policies,” Zuckerberg wrote. Trump’s comment evoked the civil-rights era by borrowing a phrase used in 1967 by Miami’s police chief to warn of an aggressive police response to unrest in black neighborhoods. On Monday, Facebook employees staged a virtual “walkout” to protest the company’s decision not to touch the Trump posts according to a report in the New York Times, which cited anonymous senior employees at Facebook. The Times report says “dozens” of Facebook workers “took the day off by logging into Facebook’s systems and requesting time off to support protesters across the country.” “I work at Facebook and I am not proud of how we’re showing up. The majority of coworkers I’ve spoken to feel the same way. We are making our voice heard,” tweeted Jason Toff, a director of product management at Facebook who’s been at the company for a year. Toff, who has a verified Twitter account, had 131,400 “likes” and thousands of retweets of his comment. He did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment on Monday. “I don’t know what to do, but I know doing nothing is not acceptable. I’m a FB employee that completely disagrees with Mark’s decision to do nothing about Trump’s recent posts, which clearly incite violence. I’m not alone inside of FB. There isn’t a neutral position on racism,” tweeted another employee, design manager Jason Stirman. Stirman did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Monday. Sara Zhang, a product designer at the company, tweeted that Facebook’s “decision to not act on posts that incite violence ignores other options to keep our community safe. The policy pigeon holes us into addressing harmful user-facing content in two ways: keep content up or take it down.” “I believe that this is a self-imposed constraint and implore leadership to revisit the solution,” she continued. Zhang declined to comment to The Associated Press. Representatives for Facebook did not immediately respond to multiple requests for comment Monday. Late Sunday, Zuckerberg again posted on Facebook, pledging a $10 million donation to racial justice groups. But he made no mention of Trump’s posts. Instead, he highlighted Facebook’s role in the spreading of the video of George Floyd’s death. Floyd, a black man who was in handcuffs at the time, died after a white police officer ignored bystander shouts to get off him and Floyd’s cries that he couldn’t breathe. His death, captured on citizen video, sparked days of protests in Minneapolis that have spread to cities around America. “We need to know George Floyd’s name. But it’s clear Facebook also has more work to do to keep people safe and ensure our systems don’t amplify bias,” Zuckerberg wrote. Twitter has historically taken stronger stances than its larger rival, including a complete ban on political advertisements that the company announced last November. That’s partly because Facebook, a much larger company with a broader audience,targeted by regulators over its size and power, has more to lose. And partly because the companies’ CEOs don’t always see eye to eye on their role in society. Over the weekend, Twitter changed the background and logo if its main Twitter account to black from its usual blue in support of the Black Lives Matter protesters and added a #blacklivesmatter hashtag. Facebook did the same with its own logo on its site, though without the hashtag. Send questions/comments to the editors. « Previous Next »",0.0
1622628461,2020-06-01 16:45:09,NBA uses its collective voice to speak out against racial injustice,https://www.pressherald.com/2020/06/01/nba-uses-its-collective-voice-to-speak-out-against-racial-injustice/,en,False,,366984,pressherald.com,http://pressherald.com/,"In the days between George Floyd’s death at the knee of a Minneapolis police officer and a country erupting into fire and violence, a white NBA general manager pondered what the news would have meant for the league had the season not been suspended because of the coronavirus. “It would be the biggest story,” the executive said. “Rightfully so.” In a normal year, this week would have marked the start of the NBA finals. But even the biggest events on the NBA calendar slow down to address a death like that of Floyd, an unarmed black man. It tears at the racial wounds already felt by so many in the NBA. It will not be ignored. NBA players, the executive said, perhaps more than any other professional athletes, have been empowered to address any injustice, but especially racial injustice. From “I Can’t Breathe” T-shirts to Donald Sterling’s banishment to steps taken to address racially motivated fan misbehavior, the NBA hasn’t been hesitant to use its collective voice. Not surprisingly, its members, past and present, are among the most vocal athletes speaking out. Celtics forward Jaylen Brown made the 15-hour drive from Boston to Atlanta to march in the community where he grew up. Former NBA player Stephen Jackson, flanked by current Timberwolves Karl-Anthony Towns and Josh Okogie, held a passionate news conference in Minnesota to address Floyd’s death. Tobias Harris tweeted a photo of himself participating in protests in Philadelphia. Spurs guard Lonnie Walker IV helped clean up San Antonio on Sunday after a night of vandalism. Heat veteran Udonis Haslem addressed the Miami community about the need to protest Floyd’s death. Jalen Rose offered his thoughts on how he’s been affected, and how the sports community can bring about change after the death of George Floyd. (via @JalenRose)pic.twitter.com/jbjKdZ28EA — ESPN (@espn) May 29, 2020 “I wish America loved black people as much as it loves black culture,” former NBA player Jalen Rose said on ESPN last week. “We’re not here designed only to entertain. We’re actually living and breathing human beings.” Countless others, including LeBron James, have used social media to express their pain. To his 46.2 million followers, James retweeted the messages of Rose and rapper/activist Killer Mike, who appeared with Atlanta mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms on Friday to urge political responses instead of rioting. “Why Doesn’t America Love US!!!!!????” James wondered early Sunday morning. It’s been more than three years since James attracted the ire of Fox News host Laura Ingraham for discussing politics. During a segment in which she called James’ words “barely intelligible,” Ingraham punctuated her message by telling him and other NBA players to “shut up and dribble.” The NBA and its teams increasingly have supported their players’ decisions to not stick to sports. In a memo to all 30 teams, NBA commissioner Adam Silver told teams its their duty to make “a meaningful difference” in their communities. “Racism, police brutality and racial injustice remain part of everyday life in America and cannot be ignored,” Silver wrote. “At the same time, those who serve and protect our communities honorably and heroically are again left to answer for those who don’t. “…Together with our teams and players, we will continue our efforts to promote inclusion and bridge divides through collective action, civic engagement, candid dialogue and support for organizations working towards justice and equality. We will work hand-in-hand to create programs and build partnerships in every NBA community to address racial inequity and bring people together.” Several teams, including the Lakers, issued statements condemning racism. And some of the league’s most powerful black voices on its sidelines and in its front offices are speaking out too. Clippers Coach Doc Rivers, the son of a Chicago police officer, delivered a personal written message short on euphemism. Rivers calls Floyd’s death a “murder.” He recounted being called more racial slurs than he can remember. And he said inaction amounts to complicity. “Too often, people rush to judge the response, instead of the actions that prompted it,” he wrote. “We have allowed too many tragedies to pass in vain. This isn’t an African-American issue. This is a human issue.” Michael Jordan made a statement too, wading into spaces he had been reluctant to during his career. “I don’t have the answers, but our collective voices show strength and the inability to be divided by others. We must listen to each other, show compassion and empathy and never turn our backs on senseless brutality,” Jordan said in a statement Sunday. “We need to continue peaceful expressions against injustice and demand accountability. Our unified voice needs to put pressure on our leaders to change our laws, or else we need to use our vote to create systemic change. Every one of us needs to be part of the solution, and we must work together to ensure justice for all.” Raptors President Masai Ujiri wrote an op-ed in Toronto’s Globe and Mail, in which he described his reaction to seeing Floyd die on video. Ujiri also referenced his altercation with a white police officer after Game 6 of the NBA finals in Oakland, California, last June. “Our team had just won the NBA championship and I was rushing to get on the court to celebrate. I was stopped, physically stopped, by a police officer, and the confrontation turned nasty. There’s a lawsuit that’s still before the courts — he is suing me — so I can’t say too much,” Ujiri wrote. “But I will say this: If it was another team president heading for the court — a white team president — would he have been stopped by that officer? I’ve wondered that. “I recognize what happened in Oakland last June is very different from what happened in Minneapolis last Monday. My own experience only cost me a moment; Mr. Floyd’s experience cost him his life.” Phoenix Suns Coach Monty Williams wrote an open letter Sunday that began with three short sentences: “I’m angry. I’m afraid. And I’m in pain.” Williams lost his wife to a drunk driver in 2016 and showed grace and forgiveness at her funeral during her eulogy. Sunday, he delivered that same type of message. “I pray for those we have lost but more personally for those who have lost — the families of Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, George Floyd and so many before you. I know how it feels to get that call that someone you love isn’t coming home,” he wrote. “The pit in your stomach. The unequivocal feeling of helplessness. Dropping to your knees and imploring God ‘why?’ I feel your pain and can truly sympathize and empathize. I wish no one would ever have to receive that call again. “To my brothers and sisters from around the sports world, and in full transparency, help me. I’m looking for direction. I may not be the most profound or prolific – I know there are others with their own platforms out there telling yourself the same things — but we have an opportunity and I daresay, an obligation. How can we help each other find that direction?” In 2016, days after the deaths of Philando Castile and Alton Sterling at the hands of law enforcement, players from the WNBA’s Minnesota Lynx wore shirts with a declaration that “Change starts with us” on the front and the victims’ names on the back. Four off-duty Minneapolis police officers working the game walked off the job after a pregame news conference denounced the violence. “If we take this time to see that this is a human issue and speak out together, we can greatly decrease fear and create change,” Lynx star Maya Moore said that night. “Tonight we will be wearing shirts to honor and mourn the losses of precious American citizens and to plead for change in all of us.” Even with their leagues suspended, voices from all over professional basketball still are pleading, loud as ever.

Twenty-eight years in this town and on these roads, and I have never been more proud of my town than I am right now. This is beautiful.” About 200 people turned out Monday for the peaceful protest in Rockland, joining the protests that have erupted across the country after the death of Floyd, a black man, while in police custody. Derek Chauvin, a white Minneapolis police officer who held his knee to Floyd’s neck for more than eight minutes, was charged with murder on Friday. Natalie Williams | BDN Natalie Williams | BDN Initially the Rockland protest, organized by Meg Joseph, Daniel Oakes and Matthew Mulrey, was going to be contained to Chapman Park, at the intersection of Rt. 1 and Main Street, but police officers blocked off traffic to Main Street so the protesters could march down the street, ending up at the courthouse. Prior to the march down Main Street, Rockland Police Chief Chris Young and Knox County Sheriff Time Carroll joined the group in kneeling in silence for nine minutes, the approximate length of time that Chauvin knelt on Floyd’s neck. While neither Carroll or Young spoke Monday, Young issued a statement on the department’s Facebook page Monday morning calling Floyd’s death “murder.” “As law enforcement, we strive to hold ourselves to a higher standard. We must begin by coming forward and condemning unjust police violence. If we remain silent in the face of injustice, we fail to protect and serve. What happened to George Floyd is despicable – it should have never happened, and should never happen again.We don’t believe in letting evil flourish. We stand with you,” Young said. Natalie Williams | BDN Natalie Williams | BDN Mulrey led the protest with chants of “I can’t breathe,” “No justice, no peace, no racist police” ― ringing through his megaphone and then through the crowd of protesters. “I am here because there are Americans being slaughtered in the streets. Stricken down for no other reason than the color of their skin,” Mulrey, a military veteran said. “What is happening all over the country [with police brutality] is disgusting. No human being should be treated that way and I’m out here today to support my fellow Americans.” Circulating among the crowd were flyers listing the names of people of color who have died from police brutality and racially-motivated killings. Also on the flyers were a list of demands that the protesters are seeking, including civilian oversight boards for Maine police departments, comprehensive anti-domestic violence initiatives, for social workers to be included on first responder calls and for police officers to receive training on anti-racism, sexism and other forms of discrimination. Lauren Abbate | BDN Lauren Abbate | BDN When addressing the crowd that gathered at the end of the march on the footsteps of the courthouse, Barez said the protests were not aiming to create sides. “I don’t want this to turn into an us versus them. There is no us versus them. It is all of us,” Barez said. “I love you all. I am proud of you all. I am thankful for you all.”",0.0

Chief Mark Hathaway joined the president of the Greater Bangor Area Branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, Michael Alpert, in releasing a statement against what they called the “horrific actions” of the Minneapolis police officers that led to Floyd’s death. The letter was released Monday, hours before a rally organized by Racial Equity and Justice, a local social justice group, was set to be held near Bangor City Hall. The protest is one of many that have taken place or are planned across Maine. Across the country, police officers have joined protesters in condemning the Minneapolis police officers’ actions. Some have joined marches and kneeled with demonstrators in protest. In Rockland on Monday, Knox County Sheriff Tim Carroll and Rockland police Chief Chris Young knelt with protesters during a demonstration that attracted about 200 people. “While the shocking actions of these police officers do not reflect the actions of all police offi­cers nationwide, their actions erode the trust and confidence that all neighborhoods must place in their police departments,” the letter said. “We know that the Bangor Police Department must build, improve, and sustain community trust through greater transparency and approachability, continued training, and consistent professional conduct.” Hathaway and Alpert acknowledged that protests across the country sparked by the police brutality have raised legitimate concerns regarding police officers’ use of force, bias in policing, and police accountability. All four Minneapolis officers present at the time of Floyd’s death have been fired. The officer who was seen in videos kneeling on the African-American man’s neck for nearly nine minutes, Derek Chauvin, has been charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. More than a 1,000 people have died nationwide at the hands of police officers every year since 2013, according to a national database. In 2016, the Bangor Police Department and the local NAACP collabo­rated on developing a police department policy titled “Unbiased Policing” to ensure the equitable treatment of all people who engage with police officers. “Simply put — biased policing is not permitted. Period.” Hathaway and Alpert wrote in the letter about the policy. “The Greater Bangor Area Branch NAACP and the Bangor Police Department are committed to the goal of social justice: all individuals in our community must have equal rights without discrimination based on race,” Hathaway and Alpert wrote.",0.0

The S&P 500 climbed 0.4 percent after wavering between small gains and losses in the early going. Banks, companies that depend on consumer spending and communications companies accounted for a big slice of the gains. Health care was the only sector to fall. Bond yields were mostly higher, another sign of optimism among traders. Oil prices fell. Investors are balancing cautious optimism about the reopening of businesses shut down because of the coronavirus pandemic against worries that the civil unrest across the U.S. over police brutality and racism could disrupt the economic recovery and widen the outbreak. The daily protests, which began last week in Minneapolis and have since turned violent in multiple cities, are not weighing on the stock market, at least so far. “The market has been expecting a springtime for economic activity,” said Mike Zigmont, head of trading and research at Harvest Volatility Management. “If these events derail the animal spirits that the markets have been counting on across the country, then I think they will have an impact. But investors are dismissing it as a short-term, non-event.” The S&P 500 rose 11.42 points to 3,055.73. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 91.91 points, or 0.4 percent, to 25,475.02. The Nasdaq composite climbed 62.18 points, or 0.7 percent, to 9,552.05. Smaller company stocks had some of the biggest gains. The Russell 2000 index picked up 11.34 points, or 0.8 percent, to 1,405.37. The stock market is coming off its second month of solid gains. Stocks have now recouped most of their losses after the initial economic fallout from the coronavirus knocked the market into a breathtaking 34 percent skid in February and March. The S&P 500 is now down just under 10 percent from its all-time high in February. The Federal Reserve and Congress have pledged unprecedented amounts of aid for the economy. That helped spur the market’s move higher from its March lows. Now investors are betting that the worst of the recession has already passed, or will soon, as governments around the country and around the world slowly lift restrictions meant to corral the outbreak. “I think we are through the worst of it for sure, and the markets reflect that in the bounce we’ve seen,” said David Trainer, CEO of investment research firm New Constructs. This week will provide market watchers more insight on the impact that the coronavirus is having on U.S. workers and employers. Payroll processor ADP issues its May survey of hiring by private U.S. companies Wednesday. The next day, the government releases its weekly tally of applications for unemployment aid. And on Friday, the government reports its May labor market data. Analysts surveyed by FactSet expect the report will show the economy lost 9 million jobs last month. The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 0.66 percent from 0.64 percent late Friday. Oil prices ended lower. Benchmark U.S. crude oil for July delivery fell 5 cents to settle at $35.44 a barrel Monday. Brent crude oil for August delivery rose 48 cents to $38.32 a barrel. European indexes closed broadly higher. Asian markets also finished higher, including a gain of more than 3 percent for Hong Kong’s stock market.

Puritan Medical Products, which is one of only two major manufacturers of the swabs, is in the process of opening a second production site with a goal of roughly doubling monthly production from 21.6 million swabs per month to 40 million per month by August or September. The Trump administration is providing $75.5 million through the Defense Production Act to boost production. The Guilford-based company hopes to have the second production facility in Pittsfield running by July 1. Word of the visit came during a discussion between Trump and governors Monday following a weekend of demonstrations, some violent, following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Maine Gov. Janet Mills expressed concerns about ""security problems"" in light of the racial unrest. She asked the president about intelligence on protesters that he said he possessed. About 300 people in Maine's largest city marched on Sunday, blocking traffic and leaving graffiti at the police headquarters. But that was mild in comparison to destruction caused by protests elsewhere around the country. Demonstrators were outraged by video that showed Floyd was pinned to pavement by a police officer who put his knee on the handcuffed black's man neck. He was later pronounced dead at a hospital. Trump urged governors to crack down on protesters: ""You've got to arrest people, you have to track people, you have to put them in jail for 10 years and you'll never see this stuff again.""

There’s a lawsuit that’s still before the courts — he is suing me — so I can’t say too much,” Ujiri wrote. “But I will say this: If it was another team president heading for the court — a white team president — would he have been stopped by that officer? I’ve wondered that. “I recognize what happened in Oakland last June is very different from what happened in Minneapolis last Monday. My own experience only cost me a moment; Mr. Floyd’s experience cost him his life.” Phoenix Suns Coach Monty Williams wrote an open letter Sunday that began with three short sentences: “I’m angry. I’m afraid. And I’m in pain.” Williams lost his wife to a drunk driver in 2016 and showed grace and forgiveness at her funeral during her eulogy. Sunday, he delivered that same type of message. “I pray for those we have lost but more personally for those who have lost — the families of Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, George Floyd and so many before you. I know how it feels to get that call that someone you love isn’t coming home,” he wrote. “The pit in your stomach. The unequivocal feeling of helplessness. Dropping to your knees and imploring God ‘why?’ I feel your pain and can truly sympathize and empathize. I wish no one would ever have to receive that call again. “To my brothers and sisters from around the sports world, and in full transparency, help me. I’m looking for direction. I may not be the most profound or prolific – I know there are others with their own platforms out there telling yourself the same things — but we have an opportunity and I daresay, an obligation. How can we help each other find that direction?” In 2016, days after the deaths of Philando Castile and Alton Sterling at the hands of law enforcement, players from the WNBA’s Minnesota Lynx wore shirts with a declaration that “Change starts with us” on the front and the victims’ names on the back. Four off-duty Minneapolis police officers working the game walked off the job after a pregame news conference denounced the violence. “If we take this time to see that this is a human issue and speak out together, we can greatly decrease fear and create change,” Lynx star Maya Moore said that night. “Tonight we will be wearing shirts to honor and mourn the losses of precious American citizens and to plead for change in all of us.” Even with their leagues suspended, voices from all over professional basketball still are pleading, loud as ever. « Previous Next »",0.0

Please, man, please.” George Floyd pleaded, politely. He showed civility. And still they killed him. The cause of death, per the Hennepin County medical examiner, may not have been strangulation. But after watching the horrific video, the only conclusion we can see is that Minneapolis Police Officer Derek Chauvin’s continuing to press his knee on Floyd’s neck, and the actions or inaction of the other three police officers, caused Floyd’s death. We’re all for civility. We push for it in public discourse. But just as the cause of Floyd’s death is painfully obvious, so too is the fact that civility alone is woefully inadequate for this moment. Of course the violence, destruction of property, the looting, the burning of businesses — many of them minority-owned — is devastating and counterproductive. But let’s not pretend for a minute that civility will put out the fire of bigotry, systematic inequality and division that has been smoldering in this country since its inception. Quietly kneeling during the national anthem to draw attention to police brutality was civil, but it was condemned, too, and the brutality has continued. There is perhaps no greater ivory tower right now than an editorial board in Bangor, Maine — a city that is more than 90 percent white in a state that continually ranks among the least diverse in the country. We, as white people in a state that is predominantly white, do not have the answers in this national self-reckoning. But, we know that police misconduct exists, even here. We know that racism and bigotry are here. We know that white silence has perpetuated the brutality and bias that cost Floyd, and thousands before him, their lives. At the same time, we have the luxury of worrying about people gathering in large crowds, for any reason, during a global pandemic. We have the luxury of going about our daily lives without worrying whether we will be accused of a crime. We have the luxury of expecting that we will be treated fairly by the police, of not worrying that any interaction could turn deadly. For these reasons, we must speak out. We must speak up for those, like George Floyd, like Eric Garner, whose voices were not only ignored by the very people who had a responsibility to protect them, they were silenced forever. But we can’t help feeling like our words are inadequate. How do we help give breath to those who are oppressed without adding oxygen to the fire? Listening and looking around always seems like a place to start. Though Maine has thus far been spared the riots and chaos that have erupted in other states, the costs of this long-standing inequity are plain to see, particularly during the coronavirus outbreak. Even in a state as white as Maine, the virus is taking a heavier toll on people of color. Black Mainers accounted for 20 percent of the cases in which racial data is disclosed as of Wednesday’s data from the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Yet, they represent only 1.6 percent of the state’s population. The disparity is likely, in part, because of the overrepresentation of people of color and minorities in low-wage frontline jobs, and because of racial inequities when it comes to access to health care. Being aware of such an imbalance is the first step toward rectifying it. Next, comes doing something about it. That is the huge challenge facing police forces around the country. The first step (when the situation has calmed, not necessarily during a riot) is for police to step from behind their armored vehicles, their riot gear and their guns to interact with the people they are sworn to protect as fellow citizens. That’s what Genesee County Sheriff Christopher Swanson did in Flint Township, Michigan, on Saturday. “We want to be with y’all for real so I took the helmet off and laid the batons down,” Swanson can be heard saying in a video. “I want to make this a parade, not a protest.” He asked protestors what they needed. “Walk with us,” they chanted. And he did. It was “the best moment of my police career,” he said, according to the Detroit Free Press. “That would not have happened if they had not wanted to listen to what I had to say as well, so it is mutually agreed upon that I need to hear what they are saying,” Swanson added. Americans need to listen to each other, and to act on what we hear. Maybe it’s our privilege talking, but we still hope and believe that it is possible to build a better future together rather than letting the tensions of a chaotic present divide us further.",0.0

1622686866,2020-06-01 18:14:58,Portland police chief offers to meet with protesters,https://www.pressherald.com/2020/06/01/portland-police-chief-offers-to-meet-protesters/,en,False,,366984,pressherald.com,http://pressherald.com/,"More than 1,000 demonstrators swarmed Portland’s streets Monday night to protest institutional racism and violence by police against people of color, blocking streets and confronting officers on the heels of marches on Friday and Sunday that had been largely peaceful. After a calm start Monday night, things grew tense as night fell and protesters blocked the intersection at Pearl and Congress streets amid a heavy police presence, surrounding two police cruisers in a heated standoff. Protesters also later blocked a tractor-trailer from entering the intersection of Franklin and Middle streets. Around 10 p.m. about 25 officers in riot gear moved in with shields to clear a crowd near the police station blocking the intersection of Franklin and Middle streets. Protesters threw water bottles and other items at the officers as they began to push the crowd back. At least eight people had been arrested for failure to disperse as of 11:30 p.m., said Lt. Robert Martin, spokesman for the Portland Police Department. Earlier in the night, someone broke a window at Urban Outfitters on Middle Street and two or three men were seen running from the store with what appeared to merchandise. The protest began when an estimated 500 people wearing black clothing and masks gathered at the corner of India and Commercial streets around 7 p.m. They chanted “hands up, don’t shoot!” as they walked down Commercial Street. The crowd had swelled to about 1,000 people by the time it got to the police station and began chanting “black lives matter” and “I can’t breathe.” At 7:30 p.m., the protesters staged a die-in outside the police station on Middle Street, lying down with their hands behind their backs and chanting “I can’t breathe.” The crowd initially split up shortly after 8 p.m., with some protesters marching to City Hall, others to Monument Square and a third group to the fire station on Congress Street, but as darkness fell the protesters regrouped and returned to the vicinity of the police station. The protests on Monday followed smaller demonstrations in recent days. Demonstrators marched and chanted through downtown Portland on Friday and a large group assembled in front of the police station Sunday evening and demanded to speak with Portland Police Chief Frank Clark about their concerns over racial bias in policing, although the group left without hearing from the chief. Earlier Monday, Clark said he had offered to meet with two organizers of the demonstrations, reaching out to Hamdia Ahmed and David Thete, who organized marches on Friday and on Sunday. Clark said Thete eventually spoke with City Manager Jon Jennings. Thete had called for the demonstration Monday at 7 p.m. starting at the corner of India and Commercial streets. Ahmed is organizing another march Wednesday afternoon. It was not clear Monday night when, or if, the organizers would meet with Clark. “My hope was to speak to both of them preceeding the event so we can have some level of conversation, communication that’s not in an atmosphere that’s polarized, emotionally charged,” Clark said during a brief interview Monday afternoon. “We want to know what their concerns are. We want to work with them and work through things to have a better understanding.” Also Monday, Portland’s City Council passed a resolution condemning the recent killings of unarmed black men in other states and “all forms of racism and police brutality.” The resolution says city leaders pledge to protect the rights of all people and commits to “calling out hate and discrimination when we see it.” Clark’s outreach to organizers on Monday came after he did not meet with demonstrators on Sunday outside the police station. Instead, Lt. Robert Doherty addressed the crowd from a staircase, telling them the department shared the goal of keeping people safe. Doherty asked protesters to disperse for public safety during the coronavirus pandemic. He also asked if they would agree to disperse after Clark spoke, but they refused, and fanned out to neighboring intersections, where they formed human chains and lay on the pavement to block traffic. The arrests Monday night were the first in Portland since the recent demonstrations began. In 2016, Portland police arrested 18 people after Black Lives Matter protesters blocked traffic on Commercial Street on a busy Friday night amidst the bustle of the Old Port. The charges were later dropped after a disputed restorative justice meeting fell apart before it could begin. That demonstration was sparked by the police killing of Alton Sterling in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and Philando Castile, outside St. Paul, Minnesota. Castile’s death was captured on a live video taken by his girlfriend, who streamed on Facebook the traffic stop that preceded her boyfriend’s death. Protests have spread to cities across the country in the past week in response to the death of George Floyd, who also was black, after a white Minneapolis police officer pinned Floyd to the ground by pressing his knee into Floyd’s neck for nearly 9 minutes. In other cities over the weekend, some police chiefs and sheriffs have embraced protesters and marched with them in solidarity, while other departments, facing severe damage and looting, have resorted to riot-control tactics, using armored vehicles and less-lethal weapons to try to get people to disperse. “The difficulty has come in the groups moving and blocking various intersections,” Clark said. “While those are potential crimes and could lead to arrests under a particular set of circumstances, what we’ve been trying to do is facilitate that (expression of free speech). If people are committing crimes and breaking the law in terms of destruction of property or acts of violence, I expect officers would take appropriate actions.” Clark said before Monday’s protests that the demonstrations and the police response here is in contrast to other cities, where protests have evolved into fluid, violent encounters, where demonstrators’ rage over violent police tactics have mixed with looters and anarchists who have smashed windows, burglarized businesses and burned buildings and police vehicles. “We see our role in Portland is to facilitate these protesters and to provide them a safe ability to express their First Amendment rights, hopefully in a lawful and peaceful way,” Clark said. But Clark only broadly addressed the conduct of police elsewhere, where officers in riot gear have used harsh tactics to disperse crowds. Multiple large cities across the country have called in the National Guard to restore order, and are imposing curfews. In some cases, the media have been targeted by officers in riot gear wielding less lethal-weapons, including pepper filled rounds and rubber bullets. Other demonstrators have been trampled by police on horseback, or had police beat and arrest them apparently without warning. In Louisville, Kentucky, police said gunfire erupted at one demonstration and they returned fire; one man was shot and killed, but it’s still unclear who fired the fatal round. For years, activists in Portland have joined in solidarity and demonstrated against the killing of unarmed people across the country, starting after the 2014 shooting death of Michael Brown, a black teenager from Ferguson, Missouri, by a white police officer. The activism and demonstrations that followed Brown’s death spawned the Black Lives Matter movement, a broad, loosely organized coalition of anti-racists who demand that police stop killing their friends and relatives. Since then, protests have erupted across cities following incidents of police violence against black people, especially in cases where the deaths were caught on video, sometimes contradicting the police version of events. The latest spate of killings include the February shooting death of Ahmaud Arbery, 25, who was chased down by a father and son, Gregory and Travis McMichael in a suburban neighborhood in Brunswick, Georgia, after they suspected he was responsible for a burglary at a home under construction. Although Aubrey’s death occurred months ago, video of the shooting emerged only in April, taken by a man who was following behind Aubrey as he jogged. The McMichaels now face murder charges, and the man who took the video, William “Roddie” Bryan Jr., faces a felony murder charge. Then in March, police officers in Louisville, executing a no-knock search warrant shot and killed Breonna Taylor as she lay in bed. Taylor’s boyfriend has said he did not know the people barging into his home were police, and after he opened fire on them, officers shot back, killing Taylor, a paramedic. Tension over police violence erupted after former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin was caught on a bystander’s video kneeling on the neck of Floyd, 46, whom they had taken into custody. Police said he matched the description of someone who passed a counterfeit $20 bill inside a convenience store. Chauvin pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck for nearly 9 minutes as Floyd begged for relief, said he could not breath and called out for his mother. Chauvin did not let up, and Floyd slowly lost consciousness and became unresponsive. When paramedics arrived, they found Floyd had no pulse, and he was pronounced dead a short time later at a nearby hospital. In many communities across the country and especially during the post-slavery Jim Crow era, police embodied the use of state power to reinforce a racial hierarchy and oppress non-white citizens. Although Maine does not have a deep history of Jim Crow-era oppression, black people in Maine still see disparate treatment by police, the courts and in schools, according to the ACLU of Maine. Black children in Maine face more discipline, expulsions, suspensions and arrests at school than their white peers. Black residents have also documented ill treatment by private businesses, and in March, a 38-year-old Biddeford man was found guilty on federal hate-crime charges for his role in two unprovoked attacks on black men in Portland and Biddeford. Most recently, black Mainers suffer a far greater impact from the COVID-19 pandemic than white people, echoing a national trend, despite Maine’s relatively small non-white population. Asked last week how he could ask non-white Portland residents to trust police when officers across the country continue to kill citizens, Clark said he was disappointed that people paint with a broad brush, but understood why they might feel that way. “How we treat people, and how other officers across the country treat people will dictate how folks perceive us as a profession broadly,” Clark said Friday. ” I think we have to keep being open. We have to keep being transparent. We are concerned. We are part of the community. We don’t want to be seen as a different force.” Send questions/comments to the editors. « Previous Next » filed under:",0.0

While the first few hours were peaceful and non-confrontational between police and protesters, tension evolved hours into the protest as police warned a smaller group of protesters — seemingly unaffiliated with the original organizers of the rally — to leave Bangor Police Department property or risk being arrested. The rally began at 5 p.m. by the Bangor Public Library, with people lining Harlow Street and filling Peirce Park. “Say his name,” protesters chanted. “George Floyd.” While demonstrators gathered near the Bangor Public Library, speakers David Patrick of the group Racial Equity and Justice that arranged the protest, City Councilor Angela Okafor and Mayor Clare Davitt condemned the racial biases that have led to violence against black people and minorities nationwide. Natalie Williams | BDN Natalie Williams | BDN Protesters, many holding “Black Lives Matter” signs, lined Harlow Street in front of the library, which was shut off to traffic, and gathered around the speakers. Most protesters wore face coverings as a precaution against the spread of the coronavirus. “Your words on social media posts are not enough. Your promises are not enough,” Okafor said to the crowd. “I can’t breathe because your privilege has caused me a lot of hardship and pain.” Demonstrators later walked through downtown Bangor and up Main Street to Davenport Park at the intersection of Main and Cedar streets, across from the Bangor Police Department. Additional speakers addressed the crowd and an a cappella group from the University of Maine performed at Davenport Park before protesters crossed Main Street onto Bangor Police Department property. Organizer Desiree Vargas from Racial Equity and Justice ended the protest, but a group of people decided to cross the street to continue protesting on police station property. Natalie Williams | BDN Natalie Williams | BDN Police officers backed up against the police department building as protesters continued chanting Floyd’s name and drew closer. At the forefront of that group was Dante McAllister, who led the group in the “Black Lives Matter” chant. He hugged police officers and shook their hands as the crowd continued chanting. “Their reaction wasn’t aggressive, they wanted to hear what I wanted to say,” he said. “And I told them, and showed it. We all have to love each other.” Around 8 p.m. after most protesters — including the march organizers — had left, a group of fewer than 100 remained at the Bangor Police Department. Some of these were newcomers, who were not part of the original protest. At that point, Bangor police gave the crowd two warnings to leave the property and called in reinforcement from the Brewer Police Department and the Penobscot County Sheriff’s Office. The protesters moved onto private property adjacent to the police station, and more than 20 officers equipped with face shields and batons blocked the entrance to the Bangor Police parking lot, a narrow strip of grass separating them from the protesters. Natalie Williams | BDN Natalie Williams | BDN By this time, there were few black lives matter chants. Most people who were still there were not part of the organized rally. Eventually, police cleared the scene at 10 p.m., leaving a few stragglers behind. Over the past week, protesters across the country have called attention to racial injustice and police brutality through rallies. The first one started in Minneapolis following the death of George Floyd, a black man, who died after a white Minneapolis police officer pinned him to the ground, kneeling on his neck for 8 minutes and 46 seconds. The police officer, Derek Chauvin, was charged with murder. Three others who were present during Floyd’s death have not been charged, but they have been fired from the Minneapolis Police Department. Two autopsies released Monday cited differing causes of death — a private autopsy by doctors working with Floyd’s family cited asphyxiation while the official coroner’s report cited cardiopulmonary arrest — but agreed Floyd’s death was a homicide, The New York Times reported. Natalie Williams | BDN Natalie Williams | BDN Rallies have been largely peaceful during the day, though some have turned violent overnight. Bangor’s protest was one of many that Floyd’s death sparked over the past few days in Maine. Multiple protests in Portland started last week, and hundreds gathered there again on Sunday, ending up on the steps of the police station in Maine’s largest city. On Sunday afternoon, hundreds of people took to the streets to protest police brutality and racial inequality in Lewiston-Auburn and Belfast, and dozens of people flocked to the University of Maine flagship campus, which has been closed since March. On Monday afternoon, hundreds also gathered in Waterville and Rockland. In Rockland, Knox County Sheriff Tim Carroll and Rockland police Chief Chris Young joined protesters as they knelt silently for nine minutes. In Bangor, the protest took place hours after the city’s police department and the local branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People issued a joint statement condemning the “horrific actions” of the Minneapolis police officers that led to Floyd’s death.

""The important conversation -- we just want to make sure it does continue, a constructive one, one of positivity. The message does have to be heard, but we're not going to condone or accept violence by any individuals,"" Sununu said. ""I'm here to assure the people of New Hampshire that we're putting in every effort to make sure we're prepared for whatever scenarios come."" Sununu said he called protesters ahead of a peaceful march in Manchester on Saturday to tell them he supported their message. On Monday, about 60 people gathered at Hampton Beach for another protest, including several officers who joined in by taking a knee. Participants held signs that read ""White Silence is Violence"" and ""We stand with black lives."" The protest followed a call in which President Donald Trump berated most of the nation's governors as ""weak"" for not cracking down harder on protesters. Asked to respond, Sununu said he is focused more on learning from governors and mayors around the country than on Trump's comments. ""The president's rhetoric is the president's rhetoric,"" he said. As for Trump's comments urging local officials to ""dominate"" the streets, Sununu said, ""No, I don't think anyone needs to be dominated."" ""If anything, here in New Hampshire we've shown working together in a very constructive and peaceful way is clearly a pathway to be successful,"" he said. Another reporter asked Sununu whether he'd encourage other groups to violate the state's stay-at-home order and prohibition on large gatherings. ""Those that want to compare social injustices and issues surrounding the murder of George Floyd to the effectiveness of a stay-at-home order and social gatherings are completely missing the point,"" he said.

1622689901,2020-06-01 18:02:17,Black Lives Matter protests continue across Maine,http://rssfeeds.wcsh6.com/~/625801500/0/newscentermaine/news~Black-Lives-Matter-protests-continue-across-Maine,en,False,,114170,News Center Maine,https://www.newscentermaine.com/,"MAINE, USA — Black Lives Matter protests continue for the fourth day across Maine, as hundreds take to the streets in protest against police brutality in the wake of George Floyd's death. The protests had remained peaceful until late Monday night in Portland when police in riot gear fired pepper spray into the crowd. Other reports say officers advanced up Franklin Street after a cargo truck drove through the crowd. Protestors pushed back, and things have divulged, at times, into chaos. The Portland Press Herald reports at least eight people had been arrested for failure to disperse as of 11:30 p.m., according to Lt. Robert Martin. People continued to gather near the Portland Public Safety building, at times blocking the roadway. At the intersection of Franklin and Middle Streets in Portland, police officers from Portland, Auburn, and the Sheriff's Dept. formed a barrier blocking the roadways, periodically inching the crowd back in an attempt to disperse the crowd. At times, a few stray protestors away from the crowd near the police barrier would throw water bottles towards the police, inciting police reaction. Many protestors urged them to stop throwing things, which turned a peaceful demonstration violent at times. Officers deployed pepper spray and fired rounds of blanks and rubber pepper balls. But protestors stayed their ground and as of 1 a.m. Tuesday the protest continues. An organizer told NEWS CENTER Maine's Hannah Dineen they plan to stay ""as long as it takes"" and that even if police disperse them, they'll be back tomorrow. ""This is the resilience and the energy that these people have, that we have, for this movement and what we stand for,"" he said, ""and so we'll be back...but for tonight, we're going to ride this out and see how this goes. We're here for the long haul.""

""I said, ‘I need to step up,’"" said Chiza, 22, of Manchester. ""I need to make change. They need to hear us because enough is enough because it just keeps happening over and over again."" Chiza joined nearly 200 people Monday at the Seashell Stage at Hampton Beach for a Black Lives Matter protest of the killing of Floyd. He also attended similar protests in Manchester and in Boston. Attendees at Hampton Beach held up signs reading ""End Police Brutality,"" ""Justice for Floyd,"" ""Outraged"" and ""My Life Matters."" They stood silently with one hand in the air as the words of Martin Luther King Jr. played on a loudspeaker. The speech played was King’s ""The Three Evils of Society,"" which he gave at the height of the civil rights movement. Gerald Kimani, of Haverhill, Massachusetts, held up a sign that stated ""I am not a threat. You can kill some of us, but you can’t kill all of us."" ""It’s getting old and we all need to stand together,"" said Kimani, on what brought him out. ""It’s not about black people. It’s not about white people. It’s about all of us. It’s about all of us versus the racists."" Portsmouth resident Keondray Lucas said he felt compelled to come out and protest the ""injustices in our law system. ... That’s not saying all cops are bad. I don’t believe that at all. I believe that people are confused and scared and they want justice. They want peace. They want to go outside without fearing the people who are supposed to be there to protect us."" After the rally, attendees spoke out, urging those in attendance to keep making their voices heard. They also chanted ""I can’t breathe, I can’t breathe,"" words uttered by Floyd as an officer held him down with a knee over his neck. One attendee asked for the police officers in attendance to take a knee with them in solidarity. Hampton police Lt. Alex Reno and Seabrook Police Deputy Chief Kevin Gelineau joined them. ""The lieutenant and I thought it was the right move,"" Gelineau said. ""We are supportive of their message. We understand and we are as devastated as they are. We don’t agree with what happened. Just because I wear a badge, doesn’t mean every decision a police officer makes in the country is supported by me simply because we are on the same job. And so we felt it was right to show them that we recognize why they are here and we are glad they were able to have a peaceful protest."" Prior to the rally, Reno stopped to talk to protesters individually. ""We were just letting them know that we know why they are here and that nothing makes a good cop more angry than bad cops,"" Reno said. Sununu weighs in Republican New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu said Monday his office will continue to monitor and work with groups protesting the death of George Floyd while also preparing for potential violence. ""The important conversation -- we just want to make sure it does continue, a constructive one, one of positivity. The message does have to be heard, but we're not going to condone or accept violence by any individuals,"" Sununu said. ""I'm here to assure the people of New Hampshire that we're putting in every effort to make sure we're prepared for whatever scenarios come."" The protest at Hampton Beach Monday followed a call in which President Donald Trump berated most of the nation's governors as ""weak"" for not cracking down harder on protesters. Asked to respond, Sununu said he is focused more on learning from governors and mayors around the country than on Trump's comments. ""The president's rhetoric is the president's rhetoric,"" he said. As for Trump's comments urging local officials to ""dominate"" the streets, Sununu said, ""No, I don't think anyone needs to be dominated."" ""If anything, here in New Hampshire we've shown working together in a very constructive and peaceful way is clearly a pathway to be successful,"" he said. Another reporter asked Sununu whether he'd encourage other groups to violate the state's stay-at-home order and prohibition on large gatherings. ""Those that want to compare social injustices and issues surrounding the murder of George Floyd to the effectiveness of a stay-at-home order and social gatherings are completely missing the point,"" he said.

1622718368,2020-06-01 19:01:58,Biden vows to take on systematic racism,https://www.pressherald.com/2020/06/01/biden-vows-to-take-on-systematic-racism/,en,False,,366984,pressherald.com,http://pressherald.com/,"WILMINGTON, Del. — Joe Biden vowed to address institutional racism in his first 100 days in office as he sought to elevate his voice Monday in the exploding national debate over racism and police brutality. The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee offered emotional support and promised bold action during an in-person discussion with black leaders in Delaware and a subsequent virtual meeting with big-city mayors who are grappling with racial tensions and frustrated by a lack of federal support. “Hate just hides. It doesn’t go away, and when you have somebody in power who breathes oxygen into the hate under the rocks, it comes out from under the rocks,” Biden told more than a dozen African American leaders gathered at a church in downtown Wilmington, his face mask lowered around his chin as he spoke. Without offering specifics, he promised to “deal with institutional racism” and set up a police oversight body in his first 100 days in office, if elected. The former vice president also said he’d be releasing an economic plan focused on education, housing and “access to capital” and investments, especially for minority Americans, later this month. “I really do believe that the blinders have been taken off. I think this tidal wave is moving,” Biden told the mayors of Atlanta, Chicago, Los Angeles and St. Paul, Minnesota. “I realize we’ve got to do something big, we can do it, and everyone will benefit from it.” Largely sheltering in place amid the coronavirus, Biden has struggled in recent weeks to be heard from his makeshift home TV studio over the noise of dueling national crises. But after another night of violent protests, he ventured out into public for the second time in two days and just the third time since the pandemic arrived in mid-March. His hopeful and collaborative approach marked a sharp contrast to that of President Donald Trump, who has made little effort to unify the country. The Republican president slammed governors as “weak” during a video teleconference on Monday and demanded tougher crackdowns on protesters. Trump also lashed out at Biden on Twitter, writing that “Sleepy Joe Biden’s people are so Radical Left that they are working to get the Anarchists out of jail, and probably more.” Biden’s softer style may foreshadow how he presents himself in the five months before the presidential election, emphasizing calm and competence as a contrast to a mercurial president. It is an approach that carries the risk of being drowned out by Trump’s much louder voice. “He’s not in office, and he certainly does not have the megaphone like the person currently occupying the White House does, but I do think our people are looking for someone who can make them feel better during these extremely tough times,” said Rep. Val Demings of Florida, whom Biden is considering as a running mate. “America just needs to be reassured that there’s someone who’s understanding, someone who’s willing to say, ‘Yes, we do have some issues,’ and someone who’s willing to address it.” Biden delivered a well-received address on Friday calling on white people to shoulder the responsibility of ending America’s systemic racism. But he was largely out of sight over the weekend, which marked the fifth anniversary of the death of his son Beau Biden from brain cancer. Biden and his wife, Jill, marked Memorial Day by laying a wreath at a veterans’ memorial near his Wilmington home last week, and the former vice president’s campaign posted pictures of him visiting a protest site in the city on Sunday afternoon. Earlier, he wrote a post on Medium expressing empathy for those despairing about the police killing of George Floyd. In the early moments of Monday’s gathering at the Bethel AME church in Wilmington, Biden listened quietly and took notes. All the attendees, including Biden, wore face masks but lowered them as they spoke. “The vice president came to hear from us. This is a homeboy,” pastor Sylvester Beaman said before everyone bowed their heads in prayer. Biden’s standing with the black community weighs heavily as he works to deny Trump a second term. African Americans rescued Biden’s flailing primary campaign, but it’s unclear if they will turn out for him in large numbers in November. “I want to make something clear. I don’t expect anything from the black community,” Biden said Monday, insisting he has never taken its support for granted. The former vice president has been doing cleanup since telling a prominent black radio host a week and a half ago that African Americans who back Trump “ain’t black.” Yet the mayors who spoke with Biden, three of whom are black, were clearly frustrated and angry with Trump, who has offered military support to address violent protests while denying them federal support to address the coronavirus fallout and repeatedly attacking them on social media. “To see the president of the United States say that he’s going to send the military into our communities but hadn’t mentioned sending a single dime of support into our communities, speaks to where we are in America,” said Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms. Much of Biden’s campaign strategy centers on trying to draw a contrast with Trump on temperament and values. He has called the White House contest a battle for the soul of the nation and has been particularly forceful in condemning Trump’s handling of moments of racial tension. In an election that is likely to be a referendum on the sitting president, some Biden aides say privately that the best plan may be to let Trump do himself in. Yet there is also a recognition that Biden needs to do more than simply wait for voters who may be turned off by Trump to turn toward him. Some Democrats who have criticized Biden for not being more visible during the onset of the coronavirus said he is making the right moves now. “I’m sure they have some reluctance, understandably, right now to politicize it. That’s not who he is,” said Democratic strategist James Carville. “There might be a time for eloquence, but I think that simplicity is eloquence right now.” Send questions/comments to the editors. « Previous Next »",0.0
1622718366,2020-06-01 19:07:00,Barr: Law enforcement must ‘dominate the streets’ amid protests,https://www.pressherald.com/2020/06/01/barr-law-enforcement-must-dominate-the-streets-amid-protests/,en,False,,366984,pressherald.com,http://pressherald.com/,"WASHINGTON — U.S. officials vowed to “maximize federal law enforcement presence” in the nation’s capital on Monday night after days of violent demonstrations led to fires across Washington and left scores of businesses with broken windows and dozens of police officers injured. In a call with governors, President Trump and Attorney General William Barr also encouraged more aggressive action against those who cause violence during protests across the country following the killing of George Floyd, a handcuffed black man who died after a white Minneapolis policeman pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes even after Floyd stopped moving and pleading for air. The demonstrations have turned violent in several cities, with fires ignited in Lafayette Park across from the White House. The comments from Trump, Barr and other federal officials appeared aimed at avoiding similar scenes on Monday night, when protesters are expected to gather again. But there are also questions about whether using more aggressive law enforcement measures against demonstrators protesting police brutality would only increase tensions. Barr told the state leaders that law enforcement officials must “have adequate force” and “go after troublemakers.” “Law enforcement response is not going to work unless we dominate the streets,” Barr said. The president urged governors to deploy the National Guard, which he credited with helping calm the situation Sunday night in Minneapolis and demanded that similarly tough measures be taken in cities that also experienced a spasm of violence, including New York, Philadelphia and Los Angeles. Between the protests and the response to the coronavirus pandemic, the National Guard has been deployed at its highest level in recent history, surpassing the number of troops sent to the Gulf Coast during Hurricane Katrina in 2005. More than 66,700 soldiers and airman have been activated — 45,000 to assist with the pandemic and more than 17,000 to help with the protests. Other law enforcement resources are also being mobilized. The Justice Department deployed the U.S. Marshals Service and agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration to supplement National Guard troops in Washington on Sunday. By midnight, Barr had ordered the FBI to deploy its Hostage Rescue Team, an elite tactical unit, to the streets of the nation’s capital, a senior Justice Department official said. Barr has also directed the federal Bureau of Prisons to send teams of prison riot officers to patrol the streets in Miami and Washington, D.C., said the official, who could not discuss the matter publicly and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity. The U.S. Park Police and Secret Service have had dozens of officers out in riot gear in Washington for the last few nights, in addition to the Metropolitan Police Department. U.S. Customs and Border Protection was also sending officers, agents and aircraft around the country to assist other law enforcement agencies “confronting the lawless actions of rioters,” the agency said. The officers were being deployed in several states, though the official declined to provide specific details, citing security concerns. Several major cities have enacted curfews, and District of Columbia Mayor Muriel Bowser set a 7 p.m. curfew for Monday and Tuesday. Violent demonstrators ignored the 11 p.m. curfew the night before as they set buildings and trash cans on fire and broke into stores to steal items from the shelves. Most of the protesters have been peaceful and tried to discourage violence. Trump, Barr and others have tried to blame some of the civil unrest on left-wing extremist groups, including antifa, and other “anarchists.” Short for anti-fascists, antifa is an umbrella term for far-left-leaning militant groups that resist neo-Nazis and white supremacists at demonstrations. The FBI is using its network of regional joint terrorism task forces to “identify criminal organizers,” and federal prosecutors across the country have been instructed to share information and utilize federal riot, arson or terror statutes against any “violent radical agitators” who attempt to hijack protests to cause destruction. The Justice Department has vowed to treat the “violence instigated and carried out by antifa & other similar groups” as domestic terrorism. Although there isn’t a specific federal domestic terrorism statute, prosecutors could charge other offenses and seek enhanced sentencing. The FBI has already started questioning rioters who were arrested in several cities to determine whether they committed any federal crimes, the senior Justice Department official said. It is a federal crime to cross state lines to participate in violent riots. Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy called in the entire D.C. National Guard late Sunday, adding 1,200 soldiers to join about 500 forces that had already deployed in Washington, according to two Defense Department officials. The soldiers will also be armed, the officials said, citing the potential threat from the protesters. Additional National Guard troops from nearby states were also being called in to help assist in Washington, officials said. Units from the 82nd Airborne Division’s Immediate Response Force, normally stationed at Fort Bragg in North Carolina, are also expected to deploy to Washington on Tuesday, according to three Defense Department officials. The officials all spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. Send questions/comments to the editors. « Previous Next »",0.0

The tournament will be held in the Salt Lake City area starting June 27 with no fans in attendance. The Thorns and Courage played for the league championship in 2017 and 2018, splitting the results. The Chicago Red Stars and the Orlando Pride will also meet on opening day. One of those games will be broadcast nationally on CBS, the league’s new television partner this season. The league’s nine teams will play four preliminary round games, with eight teams advancing to the quarterfinals. The final match on July 26 is also set to be broadcast on CBS. FOOTBALL NFL: The Arizona Cardinals have signed tight end Dylan Cantrell to a one-year deal. The 6-foot-3, 240-pound Cantrell is switching positions to tight end after being selected as a receiver by the Los Angeles Chargers in the sixth round of the 2018 draft. He played in college at Texas Tech under current Cardinals coach Kliff Kingsbury, who is now in his second season in Arizona. Cantrell spent most of the 2018 season on the Chargers’ practice squad and was released prior to last season. He had 158 catches for 1,873 yards and 18 touchdowns during a four-year college career with the Red Raiders. COLLEGE FOOTBALL: Clemson receiver Justyn Ross, considered a first-round NFL draft pick next spring, will miss the upcoming college season due to a spinal condition uncovered after he was hurt at practice in March. Tigers Coach Dabo Swinney said Ross will have surgery Friday because of a congenital fusion of vertebrae he has had since birth. Ross also has a bulging disc. The condition was found after Ross apparently hurt his shoulder during a spring practice session before workouts were shut down due to the coronavirus pandemic. “I was shocked,” Swinney said Ross is a 6-foot-4, 205-pound sophomore from Phenix City, Alabama, who led the Tigers with 66 catches a year ago. He first gained national attention as a freshman in Clemson’s 44-16 national championship win over Alabama in January 2019 when he had six catches for 153 yards including a 74-yard TD. • Defending national champion LSU has for the first time scheduled football games with Southern and Grambling State, LSU athletic director Scott Woodward announced on Monday. Both games involving the historically black Louisiana schools will be played in LSU’s Tiger Stadium, with Southern visiting on Sept. 10, 2022 and Grambling visiting on Sept. 9, 2023. MEN’S BASKETBALL: Clemson leading scorer Aamir Simms is returning for a final season after withdrawing his name from the NBA draft. Simms had until June 3 to pull out of the draft. He had announced in March his intentions to go pro. He did not hire an agent, making him eligible to return for his senior year. Simms is a 6-foot-8 forward from Palmyra, Virginia who was a third-team all-Atlantic Coast Conference pick this past season after averaging a team-best, 13 points a game. He also averaged 7.2 rebounds and 2.6 assists. Simms was instrumental as Clemson defeated three programs ranked in the top six in the Top 25 for the first time in school history in No. 3 Duke, No. 5 Louisville and No. 6 Florida State. Simms had 20 points, eight rebounds and six assists as the Tigers won for the first time at North Carolina, beating the Tar Heels 79-76 in overtime last January. SOCCER PROTEST: Liverpool players took a knee around the center circle at Anfield Stadium on Monday in a gesture of support following the death of George Floyd. Squad members posted a picture of the act on their social media accounts with the caption, “Unity is strength #BlackLivesMatter.” The picture of 29 players from the English league leaders was taken during a training session. Star players Virgil van Dijk, Trent Alexander-Arnold and captain Jordan Henderson were among those to post the picture that was retweeted by the official account of Liverpool, which is owned by Fenway Sports Group — the U.S. company which also controls the Boston Red Sox. Liverpool also tweeted out the picture. • FIFA urged soccer competition organizers on Monday to apply “common sense” and consider not sanctioning players for solidarity with George Floyd during matches. The recognition of the “depth of sentiment” over Floyd’s death came in a rare statement by FIFA telling the global game to show flexibility and not enforce laws of soccer it helps to set. Players used weekend games in Germany to reveal messages demanding justice for Floyd, a handcuffed black man who died after he pleaded for air as a white police officer pressed a knee on his neck in Minneapolis. Germany’s soccer federation announced earlier Monday that it was assessing whether to sanction the players for breaking laws of the game that prohibit “any political, religious or personal slogans, statements or images” on equipment.

Police have cited concerns over the spread of the coronavirus. The rally has been held each year since 1990 to commemorate the lives lost in the June 4, 1989, crackdown in Beijing's Tiananmen Square. The Chinese military opened fire on citizens who were calling for economic and democratic reforms. The Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements of China, which organized the vigil, told the South China Morning Post that alliance members still planned to enter Victoria Park to observe a moment of silence that night. The alliance also asked the public to join an online gathering and light candles across the city. NPR's Emily Feng reported that the move to deny the demonstration comes amid controversy surrounding China's proposed national security law that could limit Hong Kong's autonomy. The potential law has concerned pro-democracy advocates, and as Feng noted, ""Legal scholars question whether Beijing has the authority to impose this law on Hong Kong."" In justifying an earlier extension of restrictions to June 4, police cited a lingering threat of the spread of the coronavirus, The Guardian reported. ""Police believe the event will not only increase participants' chances of contracting the virus, but also threaten citizens' lives and health, thus endangering public safety and affecting the rights of others,"" police said, according to the newspaper. Lee Cheuk-yan, who chairs the alliance that organized the event, told the South China Morning Post that he believes the government was using the pandemic to shut down the demonstration. ""We believe this is totally unreasonable and unscientific, because everything is normal in Hong Kong. They are just using this excuse to suppress our rally,"" he said, adding that many other facilities had already reopened. ",0.0
1622726502,2020-06-01 17:25:00,"From Jobs To Homeownership, Protests Put Spotlight On Economic Divide",https://www.mainepublic.org/post/jobs-homeownership-protests-put-spotlight-economic-divide,en,False,,79928,mpbn.net,http://www.mpbn.net/#spider,"Updated at 10:36 a.m. ET Wednesday The death of a black man at the hands of a white police officer has sparked days of civil unrest in the United States. Those sparks have landed in a tinderbox assembled over decades of economic inequality, now made worse by the coronavirus pandemic. Minneapolis police officers initially confronted the man — George Floyd — on suspicion that he'd used a counterfeit $20 bill to buy cigarettes. The viral video of what followed captured an individual tragedy. But it's set against a backdrop of poverty and discrimination that have long colored relations between law enforcement and the African American community. African Americans are worse off than whites by almost every economic measure. And that divide has only deepened during the pandemic that's sent the country into its worst economic downturn in generations. A survey by the Federal Reserve last year found that even in good times, African Americans are less able to pay their monthly bills than whites or Latinos. That's hardly surprising, since median income among African Americans is 41% lower than that of non-Hispanic whites. Blacks are also 40% less likely to own their homes than whites — depriving many African American families of an opportunity to build wealth. The gap in homeownership is particularly stark in Minneapolis. A study by Zillow, the online real estate company, found black homeownership in the city lags more than 50 percentage points below the white rate. ""It tells us that there's racism baked in to the housing market,"" said Andre Perry, a fellow at the Brookings Institution and author of Know Your Price: Valuing Black Lives and Property in America's Black Cities. Income disparity, segregation, and racial redlining have all contributed to low national levels of homeownership among African Americans. Although blacks made housing gains in the 1990s and early 2000s, that was reversed by the subprime mortgage crisis, which led to a wave of foreclosures. Before the pandemic struck, African Americans were enjoying a strong job market. The black unemployment rate in February was 5.8% — near a 50-year low, though still higher than the white rate. Since then, unemployment for all racial groups has soared to double-digits. But the black-white gap has not noticeably worsened. Loading... African Americans who are working, however, are more likely to hold jobs that put them at risk of infection. A survey by the Labor Department found that in 2018, less than 20% of African Americans held jobs they could do from home, compared to about 30% of whites. Higher risk of on-the-job exposure to the coronavirus is compounded by African Americans' higher rates of diabetes, heart disease and other conditions that are thought to contribute to more severe cases of COVID-19. ""There have been epidemics in the black community that have existed for generations before COVID,"" Perry said. ""COVID accentuated and exposed those epidemics."" Just as the pandemic puts unequal health outcomes under a microscope, the video of George Floyd's last moments illuminates the frustration brought about by generations of economic hardship. Four police officers have been fired over the incident. One — Derek Chauvin — has been charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Chauvin is shown pressing his knee against Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes. ""That action really symbolized the knee on the neck of black homeowners and renters,"" Perry said. ""It represents the employers who don't provide the kind of benefits and wages that will lift African American communities."" He suggested the demonstrations taking place across the country, five months before a national election, provide an opportunity for candidates to spell out how they would deal with these challenges. ""If we don't address the structural inequality,"" Perry said, ""we'll be right back in the same place when the next inevitable crisis hits."" : 6/03/20 A previous version of this Web story incorrectly said all four police officers present at the death of George Floyd are white. Copyright 2020 NPR. To see more, visit https://www.npr.org. AILSA CHANG, HOST: The viral video that sparked nationwide protests this weekend captured an individual tragedy - the death of a black man at the hands of police officers in Minneapolis. But George Floyd's death is set against a backdrop of economic inequality that has long shadowed race relations in this country. We're going to talk about that now for a few minutes with NPR's Scott Horsley. Hi, Scott. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Hi, Ailsa. CHANG: So we've been hearing an enormous amount of frustration in the last week about yet another black man dying in police custody. Can you just break down for us how economics plays into that frustration? HORSLEY: There is certainly frustration with the deadly tactics of police. But there's also frustration about the underlying circumstances that in the richest country on Earth, a man could lose his life because he's suspected of passing a counterfeit 20-dollar bill. We know that African Americans are worse off than whites in this country by almost every economic measure. Andre Perry, who studies race and inequality at the Brookings Institution, says that means blacks in general are more vulnerable to any kind of economic downturn. ANDRE PERRY: Black folk live in communities where a single economic shock can really send the entire economic hopes astray. HORSLEY: And, of course, right now, we're all living through a giant economic shock of the coronavirus pandemic. CHANG: Right. HORSLEY: People throughout the country are on edge. And that has just added more dry kindling to the woodpile where this match has landed. CHANG: Well, about the pandemic - I mean, we know that African Americans have suffered disproportionate health problems during this entire outbreak. But economically, how are they faring, relatively speaking, during this time? HORSLEY: Not well. Of course, workers of all races have seen a spike in unemployment during the pandemic. The black unemployment rate has jumped into double digits, as have other rates. But the black-white gap hasn't gotten noticeably worse during the last couple of months. CHANG: Interesting. HORSLEY: We do know, however, African Americans who are working are more likely to be in essential frontline jobs. And that puts them at greater risk of infection. CHANG: So how does Minneapolis, where this all started, stack up when it comes to inequality or when it comes to discrimination? HORSLEY: The racial divide in Minneapolis is pretty stark both in terms of income and homeownership. In fact, the gap between white and black homeownership in Minneapolis is one of the largest in the country. And that matters because for a lot of families, owning a home is the main building block of wealth and stability. If blacks aren't able to buy homes, they're missing out on an important stepping stone. Nationwide, African Americans did make some gains in homeownership in the '90s and early 2000s. But those were really wiped out by the subprime mortgage crisis. And Andre Perry says that kind of structural inequality feeds into the frustration of the people who are protesting George Floyd's death. PERRY: That action really symbolized the knee on the neck of black homeowners and renters. It represents the employers who don't provide the kind of benefits and wages that will lift African American communities. HORSLEY: Now, Perry notes these demonstrations are taking place five months before a national election. And he says this is a good opportunity for policymakers to talk about how they see policing and how they would address these longstanding economic challenges. CHANG: That is NPR's Scott Horsley. Thank you, Scott. HORSLEY: You're welcome. Transcript provided by NPR, Copyright NPR.",0.0
1622729730,2020-06-01 19:32:01,Trump warns of military deployment after police tear-gas protesters,https://www.pressherald.com/2020/06/01/trump-warns-of-military-deployment-after-police-tear-gas-protesters/,en,False,,366984,pressherald.com,http://pressherald.com/,"WASHINGTON — Wielding extraordinary federal authority, President Trump threatened the nation’s governors on Monday that he would deploy the military to states if they did not stamp out violent protests over police brutality that have roiled the nation over the past week. His announcement came as police under federal command forced back peaceful demonstrators with tear gas so he could walk to a nearby church and pose with a Bible. Trump’s bellicose rhetoric came as the nation convulsed through another round of violence over the death of George Floyd at a time when the country is already buckling under the coronavirus outbreak and the Depression-level unemployment it has caused. The president demanded an end to the heated protests in remarks from the White House Rose Garden and vowed to use more force to achieve that aim. If governors throughout the country do not deploy the National Guard in sufficient numbers to “dominate the streets,” Trump said the U.S. military would step in to “quickly solve the problem for them.” “We have the greatest country in the world,” the president declared. “We’re going to keep it safe.” Related Trump threatens military force against protesters nationwide A military deployment by Trump to U.S. states would mark a stunning federal intervention rarely seen in modern American history. Yet the message Trump appeared to be sending with the brazen pushback of protesters outside the White House was that he sees few limits to what he is willing to do. Some around the president likened the moment to 1968, when Richard Nixon ran as the law-and-order candidate in the aftermath of a summer of riots, capturing the White House. But despite his efforts to portray himself as a political outsider, Trump is an incumbent who risks being held responsible for the violence. Minutes before Trump began speaking, police and National Guard soldiers began aggressively forcing back hundreds of peaceful protesters who had gathered in Lafayette Park, across the street from the White House, where they were chanting against police brutality and Floyd’s death in Minneapolis. As Trump spoke, tear gas canisters could be heard exploding. Floyd died last week after he was pinned to the pavement by a police officer who put his knee on the handcuffed black man’s neck until he stopped breathing. His death set off protests that spread from Minneapolis across America. His brother Terrence pleaded with protesters on Monday to remain peaceful. Five months before Election Day, the president made clear that he would stake his reelection efforts on convincing voters that his strong-arm approach was warranted to quell the most intense civil unrest since the 1960s. He made little effort to address the grievances of black Americans and others outraged by Floyd’s death and the scourge of police brutality, undermining what his campaign had hoped would be increased appeal to African American voters. The scene in and around the White House on Monday night appeared to be carefully orchestrated. As the crowd of protesters grew, Attorney General William Barr arrived in Lafayette Park to look over at the demonstrations and the swarm of law enforcement. The sudden shift in tactics against the protesters was initially a mystery. Then, after finishing his Rose Garden remarks, Trump emerged from the White House gates and walked through the park to St. John’s Church, where an office had been set on fire the previous night. Trump, who rarely attends church, held up a Bible and gathered a group of advisers — all white — to pose for photos. The moment was quickly decried by Trump’s critics, with New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo saying the president “used the military to push out a peaceful protest so he could have a photo op at a church.” “It’s all just a reality TV show for this president,” he said on Twitter. “Shameful.” Federal law permits presidents to dispatch the military into states to suppress an insurrection or if a state is defying federal law, legal experts said. But Trump’s statements also set up an immediate conflict with officials in New York and other states who asserted that the president does not have the unilateral right to send in troops against the will of local governments. The country has been beset by angry demonstrations for the past week in some of the most widespread racial unrest in the U.S. since the 1960s. Spurred largely by Floyd’s death, protesters have taken to the streets to decry the killings of black people by police. Minneapolis Officer Derek Chauvin has been charged with murder, but protesters are demanding that three of his colleagues be prosecuted, too. All four were fired. While most of the demonstrations have been peaceful, others have descended into violence, leaving neighborhoods in shambles, stores ransacked, windows broken and cars burned, despite curfews around the country and the deployment of thousands of National Guard members in at least 15 states. On Monday, demonstrations erupted from Philadelphia, where hundreds of protesters spilled onto a highway in the heart of the city, to Atlanta, where police fired tear gas at demonstrators, to Nashville, where more than 60 National Guard soldiers put down their riot shields at the request of peaceful protesters who had gathered in front of Tennessee’s state Capitol to honor Floyd. Two people were killed during protests in the Chicago suburb of Cicero, authorities said, but provided no details. In Louisville, Kentucky, riot police firing tear gas scattered several hundred protesters from downtown, violently capping a day of mostly peaceful protests. A vehicle plowed through a group of law enforcement officers at a demonstration in Buffalo, New York, injuring at least two. Video from the scene showed the vehicle accelerating through an intersection shortly after officers apparently tackled a protester and handcuffed him. The officers were hospitalized in stable condition, authorities said. In New York City, where nightfall has brought widespread scenes of destruction, large crowds rallied peacefully in Times Square and Brooklyn during the day. Then, in early evening, looters rushed into a Nike store in Manhattan and protesters smashed storefront windows near Rockefeller Center. Video posted on social media showed some protesters arguing with people breaking windows, urging them to stop. The city has already endured immense commercial damage from the unrest. On Monday, rioters got through the doors of the city’s flagship Macy’s store, famous for its Thanksgiving Day parade, and police later pulled at least two handcuffed men out of the store and put them into a van. By that time, most of the the street was littered with broken glass. In Washington, protesters continued marching peacefully through Washington hours after being forced from Lafayette park and past the 7 p.m. curfew. Eventually, within sight of the Capitol building, the marchers were turned back by law enforcement officers using tear gas, pellets and low-flying helicopters kicking up debris. As they dispersed, some protesters smashed windows at a nearby office building. Earlier Monday, Trump told the nation’s governors in a video conference that they “look like fools” for not deploying even more National Guard troops. “Most of you are weak,” he said. He added: “You’ve got to arrest people, you have to track people, you have to put them in jail for 10 years and you’ll never see this stuff again.” Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, a Democrat, dismissed Trump’s comments as the “rantings of an insecure man trying to look strong after building his entire political career on racism.” Former Vice President Joe Biden, the Democratic presidential candidate, vowed to address institutional racism in his first 100 days in office. He met in person with black leaders in Delaware and also held a virtual meeting with big-city mayors. Biden said hate emerges “when you have somebody in power who breathes oxygen into the hate.” In Minneapolis, meanwhile, Floyd’s brother Terrence made an emotional plea for peace at the site where Floyd was arrested. “Let’s switch it up, y’all. Let’s switch it up. Do this peacefully, please,” Terrence Floyd said as he urged people to use their power at the ballot box. Also Monday, an autopsy commissioned for Floyd’s family found that he died of asphyxiation from neck and back compression, the family’s attorneys said. Authorities in many cities have blamed the violence on outside agitators, though have provided little evidence to back that up. But on Monday, federal authorities arrested a 28-year-old Illinois man saying he had posted self-recorded video on his Facebook page last week that showed him in Minneapolis handing out explosive devices and encouraging people to throw them at law enforcement officers. More than 5,600 people nationwide have been arrested over the past week for such offenses as stealing, blocking highways and breaking curfew, according to a count by The Associated Press.

Trump said he would mobilize “thousands and thousands"" of soldiers to keep the peace if governors did not use the National Guard to shut down the protests. Loud tear gas explosions could be heard as authorities moved what appeared to be peaceful protests in the park. The escalation came just after Attorney General William Barr came to the park to to survey the demonstrators. RELATED: Trump slams governors as 'weak,' urges crackdown on protests RELATED: Trump visits vandalized church after tear gas used to clear peaceful protest Minutes after his speech, Trump made a brief visit outside the 200-year-old church near the White House that was set on fire over the weeekend. Law enforcement cleared protesters out of the area with tear gas before Trump’s visit. Tear gas canisters could be heard exploding as Trump spoke in the Rose Garden. He then walked over to the church. The protesters appeared to be acting peacefully before they were dispersed by force. According to senior defense officials, between 600 and 800 National Guard members from five states were being sent to Washington to provide assistance. Those troops were either already on the ground or will arrive by midnight. Under the Civil War-era Posse Comitatus Act, federal troops are prohibited from performing domestic law enforcement actions such as making arrests, seizing property or searching people.

""I would really like to express our condolences, our thoughts, and prayers to the family and friend of George Floyd. We've obviously seen the video that has been published nationally and we're extremely shocked,"" Clark said. ""We knew there was going to be an impact here, even though we're geographically detached from the city [of Minneapolis] that that was going to be something that was going to reverberate around the country, as it should, and it certainly has."" Protests have broken out across the country and across the world. Some have turned violent, while others—including those in Maine—have remained peaceful, though emotionally charged. ""What I saw on that video in no way reflects the values and professionalism I'm used to seeing here in the city of Portland,"" Clark said. The video, which sparked outrage and the reignited the Black Lives Matter movement nationwide, shows the now-former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin kneeling on Floyd's neck for nine minutes. His last words were ""I can't breathe,"" which has become a rally cry for protestors. RELATED: 'I can't breathe': Protests over George Floyd's death reach Portland RELATED: Derek Chauvin charged with 3rd degree murder, manslaughter in death of George Floyd ""In terms of the protests we've seen here in the last few days, we've reached out to some of the organizers on Friday and we reached out again today [Monday] to a couple of the protesters. We still haven't heard back of made arrangements to sit down with any of them yet."" At the peaceful protest in Portland on Sunday, protestors stood their ground for hours on the steps of the Portland police station, trying to get the Chief to address the crowd. Peaceful negotiations went on for hours, and at one point police handed signs back out to the protestors, that had been taken by police from the George Floyd vigil site in the midst of the protests. ""What I can say to the people who were here [Sunday] and on Friday is we understand why you're here. We saw the video, we have the same concerns and we get it,"" Clark continued. ""The first time I saw it, I just said 'get off his neck,' the more time that went on, the more astounded I got. So I get why people are here, I get why people are angry."" Meanwhile, in Bangor at a protest on Monday, Bangor Police are kneeling with protestors and hugging them in the streets. RELATED: “Stand beside us…please”. Peaceful protesters gather in Orono to speak out against the death of George Floyd and racism in America ""Where we need to move from here is find a direction where we can move together... We're here working with the community and we need the community's cooperation to do so,"" Clark said. ""I think what we see our role as here as police officers in this city is to facilitate the ability of people to come here and peacefully and lawfully assemble and express their first amendment rights."" Clark says in light of the tragic death of George Floyd, the department is taking a careful look at the systems it has in place: ""It's something we look at on an on-going basis, but when a particular tragedy such as this happens we won't hesitate to look at our policies, to look at our training, to look at our hiring process, how we train our supervisors and that's something we're doing as we speak."" When asked what he believes are the necessary steps to implement change, Clark said: ""I think it's the relationships our officers have on the streets with members of various communities in the city on a day to day basis. Those relationships are key to moving forward.""

In order to keep protests peaceful, Clark says communication is essential. ""That's where I think it's so important that we have communication. We need to establish an open dialogue with those who are organizing these protests so we can have that conversation up-front: What is it you're trying to accomplish during today's protest? Who do you expect? Where do you want it to go? What do you want to do? Where do you want it to be? It's really getting into the nitty-gritty and it's having those relationships and that's exactly what we've been trying to do... reach out, build those bridges, and actually have those conversations."" Asked about the vandalism to the Portland Police Department, Clark says he's ""disappointed, to say the least, that that was where it had to go."" According to some protestors, the vandalism happened when the large crowd left the police station and headed back towards Monument Square on Sunday. They say a few outliers were responsible. ""I get there's emotion and that was an expression of their emotions, but it's very disappointing. Where the line is in terms of our mission to try to protect folks' rights to peacefully protest stops at the line where people are starting to break the law, where people are causing property damage or any sort of violence, that is where we'll take swift action."" Clark expresses hope an optimism that folks will continue to protest peacefully and that kind of swift action will not be necessary. ""The trust our community has within its police force is extremely critical. Without that trust, we're not in a good place. We're going to continue to work hard as an agency. The incidents that have happened have only emboldened our desire to move forward, to look at our policies to look at our training, look at our practices, and to be, what I think we have here already, which is a professional law enforcement agency, but we'll make it even more so.""

The Lewiston Middle School student said he supported the cause that drew more than 350 people to the impromptu march to demand justice in the wake of the May 25 killing of George Floyd by police in Minnesota. “We’re getting killed for walking in the streets,” Said said. “These cops keep shooting us for dead.” In the hope of forging a better future, a racially mixed and mostly young crowd marched more than five miles through Lewiston and Auburn on Monday afternoon holding signs and chanting for justice. “For too long, black lives have been taken too early,” said Lewiston City Council member Safiya Khalid. It has to stop, she told the crowd from the steps of the police station. “No more. No more violence. No more senseless killings,” Khalid told the cheering crowd. “It has gone on for way too long.” Some of the signs held by marchers contained lists of the familiar names of black men and women who died at the hands of the police or white vigilantes. Cliff Odle, who teaches theater at Bates College, said he came because his 13-year-old daughter heard about the rally and he thought they should attend. Odle called the event “a necessary action” to give a voice to the demand for justice that is ringing throughout the country. Lewiston, he said, is not an island, but part of a whole that has seen too many die like Floyd, pinned beneath a police officer’s knee as he begged, fruitlessly, for breath. The officer has been charged with third-degree murder as authorities in Minnesota continue to investigate. Three other officers at the scene of Floyd’s death were fired. The killing has set off a surge of protests across the country that have included peaceful demonstrations by millions, as well as clashes between police and more militant protesters in many large cities and some smaller communities. Lewiston Mayor Mark Cayer, who marched along with the crowd, said he knows there is frustration and anger that he can see plainly. But, he said, he hasn’t “lived it” like so many non-white Americans, so he came to hear them. It is important, Cayer said, for the city “to provide a safe place” for the community speak. The police were eager to offer protection for the marchers, blocking off intersections and shutting down traffic as at least 350 people hoofed around Lewiston and Auburn chanting “No Justice/No Peace” and other slogans. Perhaps the most common one was a call and response, “Say his name/George Floyd” over and over, an effort to burrow his name and his death into the consciousness of the nation. The marchers set out from Kennedy Park about 3:15 p.m., headed down Chestnut Street to Lincoln Street before crossing the bridge into Auburn. Setting a brisk pace, they walked on Court Street until they reached Goff Street, proceeding to Dennison Street to Turner Street and then back across the bridge, down Lisbon Street and back to the park. Four miles in little more than an hour wasn’t quite enough. The marchers headed up Birch Street to Bartlett Street and then turned back to the park along Walnut Street. There were no serious problems for police along the route. At one point, a black man stood in front of a state police car for a minute, blocking its way, until he gave way to the pleading of other marchers to let the officer do his job. At the end of the march, a woman yelling that “All Lives Matter” drew a small crowd ready to argue, but they dispersed after a number of people urged them not to let her effort to antagonize them succeed. Odle said he was encouraged to see so many young people pushing for a more just world. His generation, he said, “dropped the ball,” but he’s determined to do what he can to create a better future for his children. As a black man, Odle said, he knows what it’s like to be pulled over by police while he’s driving or eyed suspiciously for matching some vague description of a possible criminal. It’s not how the country should be, he said. By the time the marchers reached the police station beside the park about 4:45 p.m., Khalid said she had long since lost her voice. But when offered a megaphone, she managed to get a few words out, even if most couldn’t hear them especially well. Khalid, the first elected city councilor from the Somali community in Lewiston, told them she is a black woman with black brothers. She said the country needs reform. Police need reform, Khalid added. To get the policy changes that will do the job, she said, is going to take work. “You are the change we want to see in this country,” Khalid told the crowd. “We need to get our ballots and votes,” Khalid said, and get involved in elections for local, state and national offices to make sure the best candidates win. “We have to do more,” she said. Then she asked the crowd, “What are you going to do?” The answer came loud and clear: “Vote! Vote! Vote!” « Previous Next » filed under:",0.0

The rally began peacefully but devolved into the night and early morning near the police station on Franklin Street, where police pushed back a crowd and later stood opposite them. At times, they deployed pepper spray with some getting close to their line and others hurling water bottles from afar. Many protesters shouted down those who threw bottles, at one point forming a protective wall in front of police. Police arrested 23 people, according to a city spokesperson, after events escalated around 9:30 p.m. A man steered a semi-tractor-trailer truck through Middle Street, parting the crowd and antagonizing protesters. He was charged with reckless conduct with a deadly weapon, a felony, while 22 others were charged with failure to disperse. All have met bail and were released Tuesday morning. It was the biggest similar Maine protest since at least 2016. Perhaps more than 1,000 people first gathered at the Portland police station on Middle Street just after 7 p.m. and proceeded to different locations. Organizers said the police took down a memorial erected in honor of Floyd, prompting the third rally in Portland since Friday. After laying in the street to stage a massive “die-in” in front of the station, protesters erected the memorial again and moved on to City Hall. The protest moved back toward the station and held there for half-hour as state and local police gathered beyond a barricade at the top of the stairs. Organizers appeared ready to disperse the crowd for the evening, stating into a megaphone that it was time to head home and see if their memorial stays in place the next day, when the large unmarked cargo truck appeared, its driver attempting to slowly drive it through the crowd. Nobody was injured, but some protesters interpreted it as a hostile act. The truck stopped and the driver, a black man, was led away by police. It was not clear if he was among the people arrested on Tuesday, but his truck remained among the crowd. That broke down as officers with batons and protective shields fired pepper spray into the crowd. One fired a projectile believed to be a rubber bullet, which ricocheted off a pole and did not appear to hit anyone. Past midnight, more than 150 officers were on the scene, locked in a tense staredown with at least as many there to rally. “The protest organizer called out over the megaphone that it was a peaceful protest and anyone throwing anything needs to go home because they aren’t a part of this,” said Denali Fleurant, a 23-year-old white man who was pepper sprayed by police during the standoff. At the outset of the protest, Portland police Lt. Robert Doherty said he had “never seen anything like this” in more than 30 years on the force and approached protesters to wish them a safe night. City police were joined by Maine State Police, the Cumberland County Sheriff’s Office and South Portland police. At one point, some state troopers with batons, helmets and face shields complied with demands to “take a knee” while guarding a police vehicle on Congress Street.

Protest organizers have called for a meeting with Police Chief Frank Clark, who told the Portland Press Herald he had reached out on Monday to activists who organized marches in Portland on Friday and on Sunday. Their response has not been disclosed. The marches occurred along with protests in dozens of cities across the nation since Floyd, a black man, died on May 25 after a white Minneapolis police officer pinned him by the neck with a knee for several minutes. The officer was charged with murder and Floyd’s family ordered an autopsy finding he died of asphyxia. Maine cities and towns such as Bangor, Belfast and Rockland also have seen protests. Demonstrators marched through downtown Portland Friday and a large group met at the police station Sunday and demanded to speak with Clark, who did not appear.

1622758836,2020-06-01 19:32:01,Trump warns of military deployment after police tear-gas protesters,https://www.sunjournal.com/2020/06/01/trump-warns-of-military-deployment-after-police-tear-gas-protesters/,en,False,,68001,sunjournal.com,http://www.sunjournal.com/#spider,"WASHINGTON — Wielding extraordinary federal authority, President Trump threatened the nation’s governors on Monday that he would deploy the military to states if they did not stamp out violent protests over police brutality that have roiled the nation over the past week. His announcement came as police under federal command forced back peaceful demonstrators with tear gas so he could walk to a nearby church and pose with a Bible. Trump’s bellicose rhetoric came as the nation convulsed through another round of violence over the death of George Floyd at a time when the country is already buckling under the coronavirus outbreak and the Depression-level unemployment it has caused. The president demanded an end to the heated protests in remarks from the White House Rose Garden and vowed to use more force to achieve that aim. If governors throughout the country do not deploy the National Guard in sufficient numbers to “dominate the streets,” Trump said the U.S. military would step in to “quickly solve the problem for them.” “We have the greatest country in the world,” the president declared. “We’re going to keep it safe.” Related Trump threatens military force against protesters nationwide A military deployment by Trump to U.S. states would mark a stunning federal intervention rarely seen in modern American history. Yet the message Trump appeared to be sending with the brazen pushback of protesters outside the White House was that he sees few limits to what he is willing to do. Some around the president likened the moment to 1968, when Richard Nixon ran as the law-and-order candidate in the aftermath of a summer of riots, capturing the White House. But despite his efforts to portray himself as a political outsider, Trump is an incumbent who risks being held responsible for the violence. Minutes before Trump began speaking, police and National Guard soldiers began aggressively forcing back hundreds of peaceful protesters who had gathered in Lafayette Park, across the street from the White House, where they were chanting against police brutality and Floyd’s death in Minneapolis. As Trump spoke, tear gas canisters could be heard exploding. Floyd died last week after he was pinned to the pavement by a police officer who put his knee on the handcuffed black man’s neck until he stopped breathing. His death set off protests that spread from Minneapolis across America. His brother Terrence pleaded with protesters on Monday to remain peaceful. Five months before Election Day, the president made clear that he would stake his reelection efforts on convincing voters that his strong-arm approach was warranted to quell the most intense civil unrest since the 1960s. He made little effort to address the grievances of black Americans and others outraged by Floyd’s death and the scourge of police brutality, undermining what his campaign had hoped would be increased appeal to African American voters. The scene in and around the White House on Monday night appeared to be carefully orchestrated. As the crowd of protesters grew, Attorney General William Barr arrived in Lafayette Park to look over at the demonstrations and the swarm of law enforcement. The sudden shift in tactics against the protesters was initially a mystery. Then, after finishing his Rose Garden remarks, Trump emerged from the White House gates and walked through the park to St. John’s Church, where an office had been set on fire the previous night. Trump, who rarely attends church, held up a Bible and gathered a group of advisers — all white — to pose for photos. The moment was quickly decried by Trump’s critics, with New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo saying the president “used the military to push out a peaceful protest so he could have a photo op at a church.” “It’s all just a reality TV show for this president,” he said on Twitter. “Shameful.” Federal law permits presidents to dispatch the military into states to suppress an insurrection or if a state is defying federal law, legal experts said. But Trump’s statements also set up an immediate conflict with officials in New York and other states who asserted that the president does not have the unilateral right to send in troops against the will of local governments. The country has been beset by angry demonstrations for the past week in some of the most widespread racial unrest in the U.S. since the 1960s. Spurred largely by Floyd’s death, protesters have taken to the streets to decry the killings of black people by police. Minneapolis Officer Derek Chauvin has been charged with murder, but protesters are demanding that three of his colleagues be prosecuted, too. All four were fired. While most of the demonstrations have been peaceful, others have descended into violence, leaving neighborhoods in shambles, stores ransacked, windows broken and cars burned, despite curfews around the country and the deployment of thousands of National Guard members in at least 15 states. On Monday, demonstrations erupted from Philadelphia, where hundreds of protesters spilled onto a highway in the heart of the city, to Atlanta, where police fired tear gas at demonstrators, to Nashville, where more than 60 National Guard soldiers put down their riot shields at the request of peaceful protesters who had gathered in front of Tennessee’s state Capitol to honor Floyd. Two people were killed during protests in the Chicago suburb of Cicero, authorities said, but provided no details. In Louisville, Kentucky, riot police firing tear gas scattered several hundred protesters from downtown, violently capping a day of mostly peaceful protests. A vehicle plowed through a group of law enforcement officers at a demonstration in Buffalo, New York, injuring at least two. Video from the scene showed the vehicle accelerating through an intersection shortly after officers apparently tackled a protester and handcuffed him. The officers were hospitalized in stable condition, authorities said. In New York City, where nightfall has brought widespread scenes of destruction, large crowds rallied peacefully in Times Square and Brooklyn during the day. Then, in early evening, looters rushed into a Nike store in Manhattan and protesters smashed storefront windows near Rockefeller Center. Video posted on social media showed some protesters arguing with people breaking windows, urging them to stop. The city has already endured immense commercial damage from the unrest. On Monday, rioters got through the doors of the city’s flagship Macy’s store, famous for its Thanksgiving Day parade, and police later pulled at least two handcuffed men out of the store and put them into a van. By that time, most of the the street was littered with broken glass. In Washington, protesters continued marching peacefully through Washington hours after being forced from Lafayette park and past the 7 p.m. curfew. Eventually, within sight of the Capitol building, the marchers were turned back by law enforcement officers using tear gas, pellets and low-flying helicopters kicking up debris. As they dispersed, some protesters smashed windows at a nearby office building. Earlier Monday, Trump told the nation’s governors in a video conference that they “look like fools” for not deploying even more National Guard troops. “Most of you are weak,” he said. He added: “You’ve got to arrest people, you have to track people, you have to put them in jail for 10 years and you’ll never see this stuff again.” Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, a Democrat, dismissed Trump’s comments as the “rantings of an insecure man trying to look strong after building his entire political career on racism.” Former Vice President Joe Biden, the Democratic presidential candidate, vowed to address institutional racism in his first 100 days in office. He met in person with black leaders in Delaware and also held a virtual meeting with big-city mayors. Biden said hate emerges “when you have somebody in power who breathes oxygen into the hate.” In Minneapolis, meanwhile, Floyd’s brother Terrence made an emotional plea for peace at the site where Floyd was arrested. “Let’s switch it up, y’all. Let’s switch it up. Do this peacefully, please,” Terrence Floyd said as he urged people to use their power at the ballot box. Also Monday, an autopsy commissioned for Floyd’s family found that he died of asphyxiation from neck and back compression, the family’s attorneys said. Authorities in many cities have blamed the violence on outside agitators, though have provided little evidence to back that up. But on Monday, federal authorities arrested a 28-year-old Illinois man saying he had posted self-recorded video on his Facebook page last week that showed him in Minneapolis handing out explosive devices and encouraging people to throw them at law enforcement officers. More than 5,600 people nationwide have been arrested over the past week for such offenses as stealing, blocking highways and breaking curfew, according to a count by The Associated Press. « Previous Next »",0.0
1622758832,2020-06-01 20:42:26,Lewiston and Auburn police chiefs say George Floyd’s death was tragic,https://www.sunjournal.com/2020/06/01/lewiston-and-auburn-police-chiefs-say-george-floyds-death-was-tragic/,en,False,,68001,sunjournal.com,http://www.sunjournal.com/#spider,"LEWISTON — Top law enforcement officials in Lewiston and Auburn on Monday condemned the Minneapolis police killing of George Floyd last week and praised peaceful protest in reaction to its tragic nature. “Watching the video of a police officer kneeling on Mr. Floyd’s neck was disturbing and upsetting,” Lewiston Police Chief Brian O’Malley said in a prepared statement. “My sympathies go out to the friends and family of George Floyd and all of those who have been affected by this tragedy.” Floyd’s death is “an injustice that I pray will result in swift justice to those responsible for his death,” Auburn Police Chief Jason Moen said. “There is no one here at the Lewiston Police Department who believes what happened to Mr. Floyd was justified,” O’Malley said. “What I observed on the video was shocking and this type of behavior reflects negatively not only on the police officers of Minneapolis, but on law enforcement officers nationwide. He said the training each of his officers undergoes in use of force, defensive tactics and bias-based policing are designed to “prevent the type of behavior that led to Mr. Floyd’s death.” “People are understandably frustrated with what occurred in Minneapolis and many have protested peacefully to enact change in their communities and nationwide,” he said. Related Watch protesters march Monday through Lewiston and Auburn Adding their voices to the many demonstrations held nationally over the weekend, protesters here in the Twin Cities marched on Sunday from Festival Plaza in Auburn, through Lewiston’s downtown and back to Auburn, ending at the police station. On Monday, they protested in Kennedy Park in Lewiston. “Protests are an opportunity for people’s voices to be heard,” Moen said Monday. “This country has been built around the Bill of Rights and our forefathers gave freedom of speech the highest priority. I encourage people to have their voice heard.” O’Malley said the local protesters were able to express themselves “in a peaceful manner” in contrast to some incidents in major cities where demonstrations turned violent. “I continue to encourage those who want to march or protest to do so in a nonviolent way,” O’Malley said. Moen said the power of protest is weakened by violence. “Those voices become lost when violence and destruction become part of the message,” he said. “I hope that our protests remain peaceful so people can have their voices heard.” O’Malley said his department has been working with area groups, including the Immigrant Resource Center of Maine, in an effort to “create an atmosphere of partnership with the community so we can work to enhance the overall quality of life for all of our residents. The Lewiston Police Department strives to do this through mutual trust and respect and the fair and equitable enforcement of law, while carefully safeguarding the dignity of all who we serve.” « Previous Next » filed under:",0.0

After a calm start Monday night, things grew tense as night fell and protesters blocked the intersection at Pearl and Congress streets amid a heavy police presence, surrounding two police cruisers in a heated standoff. Protesters also later blocked a tractor-trailer from entering the intersection of Franklin and Middle streets. Around 10 p.m. about 25 officers in riot gear moved in with shields to clear a crowd near the police station blocking the intersection of Franklin and Middle streets. Protesters threw water bottles and other items at the officers as they began to push the crowd back. On Tuesday, Portland police said 22 people were charged with failure to disperse, and one man, the driver of a tractor-trailer, was charged with reckless conduct with a dangerous weapon for driving into the protest area. All had bailed out by Tuesday afternoon, said Lt. Robert Martin, the department spokesman. Earlier in the night, someone broke a window at Urban Outfitters on Middle Street and two or three men were seen running from the store with what appeared to be merchandise. The protest began when an estimated 500 people wearing black clothing and masks gathered at the corner of India and Commercial streets around 7 p.m. They chanted “hands up, don’t shoot!” as they walked down Commercial Street. The crowd had swelled to about 1,000 people by the time it got to the police station and began chanting “black lives matter” and “I can’t breathe.” At 7:30 p.m., the protesters staged a die-in outside the police station on Middle Street, lying down with their hands behind their backs and chanting “I can’t breathe.” The crowd initially split up shortly after 8 p.m., with some protesters marching to City Hall, others to Monument Square and a third group to the fire station on Congress Street, but as darkness fell, the protesters regrouped and returned to the vicinity of the police station. The protests on Monday followed smaller demonstrations in recent days. Demonstrators marched and chanted through downtown Portland on Friday and a large group assembled in front of the police station Sunday evening and demanded to speak with Portland Police Chief Frank Clark about their concerns over racial bias in policing, although the group left without hearing from the chief. Earlier Monday, Clark said he had offered to meet with two organizers of the demonstrations, reaching out to Hamdia Ahmed and David Thete, who organized marches on Friday and on Sunday. Clark said Thete eventually spoke with City Manager Jon Jennings. Thete had called for the demonstration Monday at 7 p.m. starting at the corner of India and Commercial streets. Ahmed is organizing another march Wednesday afternoon. It was not clear Monday night when, or if, the organizers would meet with Clark. “My hope was to speak to both of them preceeding the event so we can have some level of conversation, communication that’s not in an atmosphere that’s polarized, emotionally charged,” Clark said during a brief interview Monday afternoon. “We want to know what their concerns are. We want to work with them and work through things to have a better understanding.” Also Monday, Portland’s City Council passed a resolution condemning the recent killings of unarmed black men in other states and “all forms of racism and police brutality.” The resolution says city leaders pledge to protect the rights of all people and commits to “calling out hate and discrimination when we see it.” Clark’s outreach to organizers on Monday came after he did not meet with demonstrators on Sunday outside the police station. Instead, Lt. Robert Doherty addressed the crowd from a staircase, telling them the department shared the goal of keeping people safe. Doherty asked protesters to disperse for public safety during the coronavirus pandemic. He also asked if they would agree to disperse after Clark spoke, but they refused and fanned out to neighboring intersections, where they formed human chains and lay on the pavement to block traffic. The arrest Monday night were the first in Portland since the recent demonstrations began. In 2016, Portland police arrested 18 people after Black Lives Matter protesters blocked traffic on Commercial Street on a busy Friday night amidst the bustle of the Old Port. The charges were later dropped after a disputed restorative justice meeting fell apart before it could begin. That demonstration then was sparked by the police killing of Alton Sterling in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and Philando Castile, outside St. Paul, Minnesota. Castile’s death was captured on a live video taken by his girlfriend, who streamed on Facebook the traffic stop that preceded her boyfriend’s death. Protests have spread to cities across the country in the past week in response to the death of George Floyd, who also was black, after a white Minneapolis police officer pinned Floyd to the ground by pressing his knee into Floyd’s neck for nearly 9 minutes. In other cities over the weekend, some police chiefs and sheriffs have embraced protesters and marched with them in solidarity, while other departments, facing severe damage and looting, have resorted to riot-control tactics, using armored vehicles and less-lethal weapons to try to get people to disperse. “The difficulty has come in the groups moving and blocking various intersections,” Clark said. “While those are potential crimes and could lead to arrests under a particular set of circumstances, what we’ve been trying to do is facilitate that (expression of free speech). If people are committing crimes and breaking the law in terms of destruction of property or acts of violence, I expect officers would take appropriate actions.” Clark said before Monday’s protests that the demonstrations and the police response here was in contrast to other cities, where protests have evolved into fluid, violent encounters, where demonstrators’ rage over violent police tactics have mixed with looters and anarchists who have smashed windows, burglarized businesses and burned buildings and police vehicles. “We see our role in Portland is to facilitate these protesters and to provide them a safe ability to express their First Amendment rights, hopefully in a lawful and peaceful way,” Clark said. But Clark only broadly addressed the conduct of police elsewhere, where officers in riot gear have used harsh tactics to disperse crowds. Multiple large cities across the country have called in the National Guard to restore order, and are imposing curfews. In some cases, the media have been targeted by officers in riot gear wielding less lethal-weapons, including pepper filled rounds and rubber bullets. Other demonstrators have been trampled by police on horseback, or had police beat and arrest them apparently without warning. In Louisville, Kentucky, police said gunfire erupted at one demonstration and they returned fire; one man was shot and killed, but it’s still unclear who fired the fatal round. For years, activists in Portland have joined in solidarity and demonstrated against the killing of unarmed people across the country, starting after the 2014 shooting death of Michael Brown, a black teenager from Ferguson, Missouri, by a white police officer. The activism and demonstrations that followed Brown’s death spawned the Black Lives Matter movement, a broad, loosely organized coalition of anti-racists who demand that police stop killing their friends and relatives. Since then, protests have erupted across cities following incidents of police violence against black people, especially in cases where the deaths were caught on video, sometimes contradicting the police version of events. The latest spate of killings include the February shooting death of Ahmaud Arbery, 25, who was chased down by a father and son, Gregory and Travis McMichael in a suburban neighborhood in Brunswick, Georgia, after they suspected he was responsible for a burglary at a home under construction. Although Aubrey’s death occurred months ago, video of the shooting emerged only in April, taken by a man who was following behind Aubrey as he jogged. The McMichaels now face murder charges, and the man who took the video, William “Roddie” Bryan Jr., faces a felony murder charge. Then in March, police officers in Louisville, executing a no-knock search warrant shot and killed Breonna Taylor as she lay in bed. Taylor’s boyfriend has said he did not know the people barging into his home were police, and after he opened fire on them, officers shot back, killing Taylor, a paramedic. Tension over police violence erupted after former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin was caught on a bystander’s video kneeling on the neck of Floyd, 46, whom they had taken into custody. Police said he matched the description of someone who passed a counterfeit $20 bill inside a convenience store. Chauvin pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck for nearly 9 minutes as Floyd begged for relief, said he could not breath and called out for his mother. Chauvin did not let up, and Floyd slowly lost consciousness and became unresponsive. When paramedics arrived, they found Floyd had no pulse, and he was pronounced dead a short time later at a nearby hospital. In many communities across the country and especially during the post-slavery Jim Crow era, police embodied the use of state power to reinforce a racial hierarchy and oppress non-white citizens. Although Maine does not have a deep history of Jim Crow-era oppression, black people in Maine still see disparate treatment by police, the courts and in schools, according to the ACLU of Maine. Black children in Maine face more discipline, expulsions, suspensions and arrests at school than their white peers. Black residents have also documented ill treatment by private businesses, and in March, a 38-year-old Biddeford man was found guilty on federal hate-crime charges for his role in two unprovoked attacks on black men in Portland and Biddeford. Most recently, black Mainers suffer a far greater impact from the COVID-19 pandemic than white people, echoing a national trend, despite Maine’s relatively small non-white population. Asked last week how he could ask non-white Portland residents to trust police when officers across the country continue to kill citizens, Clark said he was disappointed that people paint with a broad brush, but understood why they might feel that way. “How we treat people, and how other officers across the country treat people will dictate how folks perceive us as a profession broadly,” Clark said Friday. ” I think we have to keep being open. We have to keep being transparent. We are concerned. We are part of the community. We don’t want to be seen as a different force.” Send questions/comments to the editors. « Previous Next » filed under:",0.0

1622793942,2020-06-01 22:13:04,Black Lives Matter protesters march in Bath,https://www.pressherald.com/2020/06/01/black-lives-matter-protesters-march-in-bath/,en,False,,338164,timesrecord.com,http://timesrecord.com/,"BATH — Dozens of demonstrators marched through Bath Monday night protesting police brutality in the U.S. The peaceful march made stops at the Sagadahoc County Courthouse, the Bath Police Department and ended in front of City Hall. Protests, vigils and marches have swept the country in reaction to the death of George Floyd, a black man who was killed when a Minneapolis police officer held Floyd down with a knee to the back of Floyd’s neck. In Bath, protesters chanted “I can’t breathe,” in reference to Floyd and Eric Garner, a black man in New York who died while being restrained by a police officer. Both men were recorded saying “I can’t breathe” in the moments before their death. Devin Moore, 28, of Bath, said the march was an opportunity to unify the city where he’s lived most of his life. “Everybody’s affected by these things,” he said. While Black Lives Matter is the narrative, “It’s not just black people.

BRUNSWICK — Hundreds of people left a Black Lives Matter vigil held on the downtown Brunswick Mall Sunday night to march to the police station to protest acts of police brutality. The protest at the police station was peaceful but tense at times, as protesters demanded officers take a knee. The group stood on the lawn of the police station, chanting, “no justice, no peace.” Then they kneeled and with fists in the air, shouted over and over, “I can’t breathe.” The words were in reference to George Floyd, a black man killed a week ago as a Minneapolis police officer held Floyd down with a knee to the back of his neck. Video recorded Floyd pleading with the officer to move his knee because he couldn’t breathe. As a result, protests have broken out in cities across the country. Sunday afternoon, more than 300 protesters marched the streets of Portland and demonstrated for hours outside the Portland police station demanding to meet with Chief Frank Clark to discuss their concerns about racial bias after Floyd’s death, the Portland Press Herald reported. Toby Holton of Brunswick was one of the protesters who marched to the Brunswick police station. A black man, he urged Brunswick officers to take a knee in solidarity with protesters. “I’m asking you, from one man to another, just take a knee with me,” Holton said to Lt. Paul Hansen, who stepped forward instead and shook Holton’s hand and embraced him. Other officers followed suit, though some protesters expressed anger that police didn’t kneel. Brunswick Police Cmdr. Mark Waltz said police didn’t take a knee because that could send the wrong message. While taking a knee could mean police support the Black Lives Matter movement, it also could send the message that Brunswick officers are like the officer who kneeled on George Floyd. “I can tell you absolutely black lives matter,” Waltz said on Monday. “Absolutely we want people of every race in Brunswick to feel comfortable and safe. Again, we’re happy to meet and participate in community events. We’ll do everything we can to make people feel safe in Brunswick.” Holton said he recently was stopped by a Brunswick officer for driving through a blinking red light and said the officer was very respectful and did his job. However, he said the United States has sat and watched the pot boil until it all evaporated regarding issues of racism and social injustice. “The fires you’re seeing in these different states and the riots that you’re seeing in these different states are not the typical angry black man that people like to portray,” he said. “It’s tiredness. It’s people who are fed up, it’s people who are just done.” Brunswick Police Chief Richard Rizzo said Monday that members of the Brunswick Police Department agree with the protesters. “The killing of George Floyd disgusts all of us and embarrassed our profession,” Rizzo said. Sunny Andersen of Lisbon also joined the protest. As a white person, she said she benefits from white privilege. The system America was built on is inherently racist and needs work, she argued. “I know it goes deep,” Andersen said. “It’s not just the Brunswick Police Department, it’s not just the (Minneapolis) Police Department. It goes a lot further than that.” She doesn’t know how much the protest Sunday in Brunswick did to dismantle that injustice, but it did offer an opportunity for healing, “and I think that’s so, so incredibly important.” Rizzo thanked the protesters for keeping the protest peaceful Sunday night. He said he is willing to listen to suggestions for how the department can improve its relationship with the community and to sit down with any group to discuss how to help community members feel safer. He can be reached at (207) 721-4317 or by email at [email protected] While Waltz said no one was arrested during the protest Sunday evening, a 21-year-old woman was arrested Sunday afternoon.

A white Minneapolis police officer is accused of kneeling on his neck for that amount of time before his death and has been charged with murder. Monday’s event was organized by several groups, including some Mount Blue Middle School students, a University of Maine at Farmington staff member and Mainers for Change. Organizers read the names of others who have been unjustly killed. Examples were given of unjust treatment of black people in the past. Farmington police chief Jack Peck Jr. spoke about the oath he took as a young officer to defend the Constitution, to protect and serve the citizens, to be fair, honest and transparent to all. Several speakers took turns on the megaphone and Peck was thanked for coming out to show people there are good police officers. Someone from the crowd said they need to work together to make change. “We need to use our privilege to dismantle racism,” Stephanie Harman of Farmington said following the march.

Amid racial unrest across the nation, President Donald Trump on Monday declared himself ""the president of law and order"" and threatened to deploy the United States military to American cities to quell a rise of violent protests. As Trump spoke, an incredible TV split screen developed around the White House. While he addressed the nation in the White House's idyllic Rose Garden, a series of military vehicles rolled out front on Pennsylvania Avenue and military police and law enforcement clashed with protesters at Lafayette Park. Those peaceful demonstrators were cleared so Trump could walk across the park to St. John's Episcopal Church, known as ""The Church of the Presidents,"" which suffered fire damage in a protest this week. Holding a Bible, he then stood with several of his Cabinet members as the cameras clicked. ""We have the greatest country in the world,"" Trump declared. ""We're going to keep it safe."" Trump said he would mobilize ""thousands and thousands"" of soldiers to keep the peace if governors did not use the National Guard to shut down the protests. Loud tear gas explosions could be heard as authorities moved what appeared to be peaceful protests in the park. The escalation came just after Attorney General William Barr came to the park to to survey the demonstrators. According to senior defense officials, between 600 and 800 National Guard members from five states were being sent to Washington to provide assistance. Those troops were either already on the ground or will arrive by midnight. Under the Civil War-era Posse Comitatus Act, federal troops are prohibited from performing domestic law enforcement actions such as making arrests, seizing property or searching people. In extreme cases, however, the president can invoke the Insurrection Act, also from the Civil War, which allows the use of active-duty or National Guard troops for law enforcement. The officials said that some of the National Guard in D.C. will be armed and others will not. They said that the D.C. guard members do not have non-lethal weapons. The military police that are visible in the city are members of the Guard. ——————- THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP's original story is below. —————————————— President Donald Trump on Monday derided many governors as ""weak"" and demanded tougher crackdowns on burning and stealing among some demonstrations in the aftermath of violent protests in dozens of American cities. Trump spoke to governors on a video teleconference that also included law enforcement and national security officials, telling the state leaders they ""have to get much tougher."" ""Most of you are weak,"" Trump said. ""You have to arrest people."" The days of protests were triggered by the death of George Floyd, a black man who died when a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee into Floyd's neck for several minutes even after he stopped moving and pleading for air. The demonstrations turned violent in several cities, with people trashing stores, smashing and burning police cars and igniting fires in historic Lafayette Park across from the White House. Accused by critics of doing too little to defuse the crisis, Trump was to address the nation early Monday evening. The president urged the governors to deploy the National Guard, which he credited for helping calm the situation Sunday night in Minneapolis. He demanded that similarly tough measures be taken in cities that also experienced violence, including New York, Philadelphia and Los Angeles. ""You've got to arrest people, you have to track people, you have to put them in jail for 10 years and you'll never see this stuff again,"" said Trump. ""We're doing it in Washington, D.C. We're going to do something that people haven't seen before."" The president told the governors they were making themselves ""look like fools"" for not calling up more of the National Guard as a show for force on city streets. Attorney General Bill Barr, who was also on the call, told governors that a joint terrorist task force would be used to track agitators and urged local officials to ""dominate"" the streets and control, not react to crowds. He urged the governors to ""go after troublemakers."" Trump's angry exhortations at the nation's governors came after a Sunday night of escalating violence, images of fires and looting and clashes with police filling the nation's airwaves and overshadowing the largely peaceful protests. The protests had grown so heated Friday night that the Secret Service rushed the president to an underground bunker previously used during terrorist attacks. On Monday, Trump also spoke of trying to criminalize flag-burning. The Supreme Court has conservative new members since it last ruled on that issue, and Trump said that ""I think it's time to review that again."" He continued his effort to project strength, using inflammatory tweets and delivering partisan attacks. As cities have burned night after night and images of violence have dominated television coverage, Trump's advisers have discussed the prospect of an Oval Office address in an attempt to ease tensions. The notion was quickly scrapped for lack of policy proposals and the president's own seeming disinterest in delivering a message of unity. Trump did not appear in public on Sunday and was not scheduled to on Monday either. The demonstrations in Washington appeared to catch officers by surprise. They sparked one of the highest alerts at the White House complex since the Sept. 11 attacks in 2001. Trump has told advisers he worries about his safety, while both privately and publicly praising the work of the Secret Service. Demonstrators returned Sunday afternoon, facing off against police at Lafayette Park into the evening. Trump retweeted a message from a conservative commentator encouraging authorities to respond with greater force. ""This isn't going to stop until the good guys are willing to use overwhelming force against the bad guys,"" Buck Sexton wrote in a message amplified by the president. In recent days security at the White House has been reinforced by the National Guard and additional personnel from the Secret Service and the U.S. Park Police. The Justice Department deployed members of the U.S. Marshals Service and agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration to supplement National Guard troops outside the White House, according to a senior Justice Department official. The official could not discuss the matter publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity.",0.0

Those at the peaceful protest said the time to act is now. “We need to make sure that every single member of our community breathes,” said Bangor City Councilor Angela Okafor. Protesters holding signs with phrases like “Black Lives Matter,” “I Can’t Breathe” and “No Justice, No Peace,” met outside the Bangor Public Library, demanding justice. The gathering follows the death of George Floyd, who was killed when a police officer kneeled on his neck in Minnesota for nearly nine minutes, an event that has sparked outrage nationwide. “We can no longer choose to be non-active,” one speaker at the protest said. “We are liable to be active participants in our healing from this disease called racism that has spread across the world.” Bangor’s city council chair said as the whitest state in the country, Maine has to work toward change. “This is a majority white community. There are absolutely wonderful people here, no question,” said City Council Chair Clare Davitt. “But that doesn’t mean you’re not necessarily racist. That doesn’t mean that you don’t have things internalized that you need to work on,” Davitt continued. “Absolutely, myself included.” Protesters then marched from the library through the streets of downtown to the Bangor Police Department, urging for police accountability. In a statement released earlier Monday, Bangor Police Chief Mark Hathaway and the President of the Greater Bangor Branch of the NAACP, Michael Alpert, condemned the “horrific” actions that led to Floyd’s death. The statement went on to say while the “shocking” actions of Minnesota’s officers don’t reflect all police, they erode trust and confidence in police in general. The statement said biased policing in Bangor is “not permitted. Period.” It also said the two organizations are committed to the goal of social justice. At Monday evening’s event in front of the department, Bangor police officers could be seen kneeling with protesters. Even with the strong showing of support at the peaceful protest, some say this is just the first step. “We appreciate you standing with us, but we want you to understand that November is coming,” Okafor said, greeted with cheers from the crowd. “You need to stand up and vote. It is not enough to just come and protest and that is the end of it. We need to vote … like George Floyd is our brother. “You vote like your life depends on it. That is the only way things can change,” Okafor said. ",0.0

My fellow Americans, my first and highest duty as president, is to defend our great country and the American people. I sworn oath to uphold the laws of our nation, and that is exactly what I will do. All Americans were rightly sickened and revolted by the brutal death of George Floyd. My administration is fully committed that for George and his family justice will be served. He will not have died in vain, but we cannot allow the righteous cries and peaceful protesters to be drown out by an angry mob. The biggest victims off the rioting are peace loving citizens in our poorest communities. And is there President? I will fight to keep them safe. I will fight to protect you. I am your president of Law and Order and an ally of all peaceful protesters. But in recent days, our nation has been gripped by professional anarchists, violent mobs, arsonists, looters, criminals, riders, antifa and others. A number of state and local governments have failed to take necessary action to safeguard their residents. Innocent people have been savagely beaten, like the young man in Dallas, Texas, who was left dying on the street or the woman in upstate New York viciously attacked by dangerous thugs. Small business owners have seen their dreams utterly destroyed. New York's finest have been hit in the face with bricks. Brave nurses who have battled the virus are afraid to leave their homes. A police precinct has been overrun. Here in the nation's capital, the Lincoln Memorial and the World War Two Memorial has been vandalized. One of our most historic churches was set ablaze. A federal officer in California, an African American enforcement hero, was shot and killed. These air not acts of peaceful protests. These are acts of domestic terror. The destruction of innocent life and the spilling of innocent blood is an offense to humanity and a crime against God. America needs creation, not destruction. Cooperation, not contempt. Security, not anarchy. Healing, not hatred, justice, not chaos. This is our mission, and we will succeed 100%. We will succeed. Our country always wins. That is why I am taking immediate presidential action to stop the violence and restore security and safety in America. I am mobilizing all available Federal resource is civilian and military to stop the rioting and looting to end the destruction and arson and to protect the rights of law abiding Americans, including your Second Amendment rights. Therefore, the following measures air going into effect immediately. First, we are ending the riots and lawlessness that has spread throughout our country. We will end it now. Today. I have strongly recommended to every governor to deploy the National Guard insufficient numbers that we dominate the streets. Mayors and governors must establish an overwhelming law enforcement presence until the violence has been quelled. If a city or state refuses to take the actions that are necessary to defend the life and property of their residents, then I will deploy the United States military and quickly solve the problem for them. I am also taking swift and decisive action to protect our great capital, Washington, D. C. What happened in the city last night was a total disgrace. As we speak, I am dispatching thousands and thousands of heavily armed soldiers, military personnel and law enforcement offices to stop the rioting, looting, vandalism, assaults and the wanton destruction of property. We're putting everybody on warning are seven oclock curfew will be strictly enforced. Those who threaten innocent life and property will be arrested detained and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. I want the organizer's of this terror to be unnoticed, that you will face severe criminal penalties and lengthy sentences in jail. This includes Antifa and others who are leading instigators of this violence. One law and order and that is what it is. One law. We have one beautiful law and once that is restored and fully restored, we will help you. We will help your business and we will help your family. America is founded upon the rule of law. It is the foundation of our prosperity, our freedom and our very way of life. But where there is no law, there is no opportunity where there is no justice, there is no liberty. Where there is no safety, there is no future. We must never given to anger or hatred. If malice or violence reigns that none of us is free. I take these actions today with firm resolve and with a true and passionate love for our country. By far our greatest days. Lie ahead. Thank you very much. And now I'm going to pay my respects to a very, very special place. Thank you very much. Advertisement GOP senators critical of President Trump's response to unrest following Floyd's death Share Shares Copy Link Copy Video above: President Trump vows to deploy U.S. military if states can't control violent protestsTop GOP senators are calling on President Donald Trump to take a far more compassionate approach amid the deep unrest following the death of George Floyd in Minnesota, raising concerns that the president's handling of the crisis so far threatens to divide a badly bruised nation further.""I think the country is definitely looking for healing and for calm, and I think that's the tone the president needs to project when talking about what is happening around the country,"" Senate Majority Whip John Thune, a Republican from South Dakota, told CNN. ""I think he needs to strike a tone that fits the level of frustration country's experiencing right now, and I hope in the future, he'll do that.""Thune added that Trump's tweets about the situation have been ""not helpful.""Sen. John Cornyn, also a member of Senate GOP leadership, told CNN that ""I think it's important"" for Trump to offer more of a unifying message in the midst of the deep unrest across the county.""I presume at some point he will address the nation,"" said Cornyn of Texas. ""If I were advising him I would say we need it sooner rather than later.""At a time when Trump could be consoling the nation, Republicans — who rarely break from Trump — are voicing their disapproval that the president has offered little in the way of condolences and instead taken to Twitter to incite divisions and cast blame.""Some of his tweets have not been helpful,"" Sen. Pat Toomey, a Republican from Pennsylvania, said at a news conference Monday. ""It would be helpful if he would change the tone of his message.""The message from his own party comes as protests have grown and spread throughout the country from Los Angeles to Washington.""We are obviously in a divisive situation right now that is escalating. ... He needs to make more unifying comments,"" said Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, a Republican from West Virginia.Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, speaking on the Senate floor, called on Trump ""to help heal the racial division.""""The president should help to heal the racial divisions in this country,"" Collins said. ""It is at times like this that a president needs to speak to the nation, to pledge to right wrongs and to calm inflamed passions.""Asked later if she thinks the president needs to offer a unifying message, Collins said: ""I do.""Sen. Cory Gardner, who like Collins is facing reelection next year, didn't criticize Trump directly but added: ""We all have to do better every day — we have to.""On Friday, the president's handling of the situation came under more scrutiny after he tweeted, ""When the looting starts, the shooting starts,"" a phrase that originated from controversial Miami police chief Walter Headley at the height of the civil rights movement. Headley, who defended practices like using police dogs and force, said at news conference ""We don't mind being accused of police brutality,"" according to an article from the period in The New York Times.""Those are not constructive tweets without any question,"" Sen. Tim Scott, the only black Republican in the U.S. Senate, told Fox on Sunday. ""I will say this, I spoke with the president (Saturday) morning, and he and I had a good conversation about the next steps. I told him, what I am going to tell you. I told him 'Mr. President, it helps us when you focus on the death, the unjustified in my opinion, the criminal death of George Floyd.'""On Monday during a private call with governors, the president continued to blast others for what has unfolded, accusing some states of being weak and arguing that law enforcement needed to ""dominate"" protestors in order to contain the demonstrations in cities across the country.""You have to dominate or you'll look like a bunch of jerks, you have to arrest and try people,"" the president told the governors in a call from the basement White House Situation Room, according to an audio recording of the call obtained by CNN.Majority Leader Mitch McConnell wouldn't answer questions Monday about whether he believed Trump had struck the appropriate tone in his handling of the unrest. Others also declined to comment about Trump's tweets, including Sen. David Perdue of Georgia, who faces voters in the fall.""Well, obviously this is an evolving situation — I think this is a difficult position the president is in,"" said Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida when asked if Trump should shift his tone to emphasize unity. On Monday, McConnell demonstrated a starkly different tone from the president from the floor of the Senate.""In no world, whatsoever, should arresting a man for an alleged minor infraction involve a police officer putting his knee on a man's neck for nine minutes while he cries out 'I can't breathe' and then goes silent,"" McConnell said. ""To me, to a great many of my fellow Kentuckians and to many outraged Americans, these disturbing events do not look like three isolated incidents, they look more like the latest chapter in our national struggle to make equal justice and equal protection of the law into facts of life for all Americans.""",0.0

We work hard at building our relationships, and I think it helps get us through troubled times.” George Floyd of Minneapolis died in police custody last Monday. The four officers who were present were fired from the department and on Friday one was charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. Indivisible MDI organized a small local vigil Friday. “This week, Americans watched a 10-minute video in which we witnessed police officers murdering Minnesotan George Floyd in broad daylight as he begged them to stop, and onlookers pled with the officer with his knee on Floyd’s neck,” the group said in a statement. Organizers of both that event and a rally Sunday afternoon said demonstrations of solidarity should be accompanied by meaningful action. “Although we pride ourselves on caring about these issues, we do very little to make systemic, meaningful change,” said Alex Burnett, a Mount Desert Island High School student who organized the Sunday rally. The plan for the event came together quickly, he said. “On Saturday, I realized that we needed to show solidarity and be there for Black people and people of color in our community.” There wasn’t time to line up planned speeches; he put an announcement on social media Saturday saying that the gathering would be held Sunday at 4 p.m. in the Village Green, and that everyone should wear masks. Meanwhile, Saturday night, the graffiti appeared on the side of a toy store near the police station, and on buildings at the town athletic fields on Main Street. By Monday, it had all already been cleaned and painted over. “As far as who did it, what I can say it it’s under investigation,” Willis said. Anyone with information related to the incident is encouraged to contact the police department. Gatherings of more than 50 people are prohibited under the current state rules aimed at preventing the spread of coronavirus; Saturday’s rally easily topped that, but almost all participants were wearing masks and made efforts to leave a safe distance between groups. At the rally, Burnett said, “a couple people volunteered to speak, and after they spoke, I offered the mic to anybody who wanted to.” Comments from a recent MDI High School graduate who has been living in Portland critical of police sparked some attendees to leave. Other speakers stood up for local police; many others have emailed or called the police department, or left gifts or meals, to express their support, Willis said. “The graffiti sucks, nobody likes to see that,” resident Bo Greene, who spoke at the rally, told the Islander Monday. “But to focus more on the graffiti than on the murder that we all watched at the hands of someone in blue, I think is a mistake. “I would jump in front of a train for Dave (Lt. Dave Kerns), and other officers, and I know they would for me,” she continued. “I can appreciate them for everything they do and still challenge them to stand up” and denounce police brutality. “And that’s what I do with the ones that I’m closest with.” Burnett said the microphone was offered to anyone who wanted to speak. “A lot of people spoke, most of them white,” he said. “Although I am super grateful for everyone who spoke, it’s necessary that, as white people, we amplify the voices of those who are marginalized. As a community we need to decentralize the white narrative and put our energy into giving power and space to Black people in our community.” “Every white person has a responsibility to seek out resources to help them understand, recognize, and learn about the racism within themselves and built into the fabric of our society. The resources and materials are there; it is our responsibility to act and learn. “Read books by black authors,” he continued. “Watch movies by black directors. Support black artists. Do your research and educate yourself, your friends, your family. Talk to your white peers. Redistribute our wealth; instead of buying from Amazon, buy from a black-owned business. “There is so much we can and must do. Black people have been doing this work since the very beginning. It is our responsibility to educate ourselves on how to take down systemic racism in this country. We do that by learning from, and listening to, black communities.” Another demonstration is in the planning stages sometime in the next two weeks, Burnett said. Willis recalled hearing a story from a police chief who had had an officer-involved shooting at his agency many years ago. “I remember him saying that he had to stand up in front of the community and say, ‘This is going to take your patience and trust, but we’re going to look into it.’ “And he said, ‘The key to the whole thing was when people believed me.’ And it worked out and it diffused the negative energy. “I think we have that here” on Mount Desert Island, Willis said. “I sure hope we do. If people are feeling otherwise, I’d encourage them to give us a call so we can get together and understand each other and move forward.”",0.0

It doesn’t go away, and when you have somebody in power who breathes oxygen into the hate under the rocks, it comes out from under the rocks,” Biden told more than a dozen African American leaders gathered at a church in downtown Wilmington, his face mask lowered around his chin as he spoke.Without offering specifics, he promised to “deal with institutional racism” and set up a police oversight body in his first 100 days in office, if elected. Biden also said he'd be releasing an economic plan focused on education, housing and “access to capital"" and investments, especially for minority Americans, later this month. “I really do believe that the blinders have been taken off. I think this tidal wave is moving,” Biden told the mayors of Atlanta, Chicago, Los Angeles and St. Paul, Minnesota. “I realize we’ve got to do something big, we can do it, and everyone will benefit from it.”Biden has struggled in recent weeks to be heard from his makeshift home TV studio over the noise of dueling national crises. But after another night of violent protests, he ventured out into public for the second time in two days and just the third time since the pandemic arrived in mid March.His hopeful and collaborative approach marked a sharp contrast to that of President Donald Trump. The Republican president slammed governors as “weak” during a video teleconference on Monday and demanded tougher crackdowns on protesters. Trump also lashed out at Biden on Twitter, writing that “Sleepy Joe Biden’s people are so Radical Left that they are working to get the Anarchists out of jail, and probably more.”Biden's softer style may foreshadow how he presents himself in the five months before the presidential election, emphasizing calm and competence as a contrast to a mercurial president. It is an approach that carries the risk of being drowned out by Trump's much louder voice. “He’s not in office, and he certainly does not have the megaphone like the person currently occupying the White House does, but I do think our people are looking for someone who can make them feel better during these extremely tough times,” said Rep. Val Demings of Florida, whom Biden is considering as a running mate. “America just needs to be reassured that there’s someone who’s understanding, someone who’s willing to say, ‘Yes, we do have some issues,’ and someone who’s willing to address it.”Biden delivered a well-received address on Friday calling on white people to shoulder the responsibility of ending America’s systemic racism. But he was largely out of sight over the weekend, which marked the fifth anniversary of the death of his son Beau Biden from brain cancer.Biden and his wife, Jill, marked Memorial Day by laying a wreath at a veterans' memorial near his Wilmington home, and the former vice president’s campaign posted pictures of him visiting a protest site in the city on Sunday afternoon. Earlier, he wrote a post on Medium expressing empathy for those despairing about the police killing of George Floyd.In the early moments of Monday’s gathering at the Bethel AME church in Wilmington, Biden listened quietly and took notes. All the attendees, including Biden, wore face masks but lowered them as they spoke.“The vice president came to hear from us. This is a homeboy,” pastor Sylvester Beaman said before everyone bowed their heads in prayer.Biden's standing with the black community weighs heavily as he works to deny Trump a second term. African Americans rescued Biden's flailing primary campaign, but it's unclear if they will turn out for him in large numbers in November. “I want to make something clear. I don’t expect anything from the black community,"" Biden said Monday, insisting he has never taken its support for granted. The former vice president has been doing cleanup since telling a prominent black radio host a week and a half ago that African Americans who back Trump “ain’t black.”Yet the mayors who spoke with Biden, three of whom are black, were clearly frustrated and angry with Trump, who has offered military support to address violent protests while denying them federal support to address the coronavirus fallout and repeatedly attacking them on social media. “To see the president of the United States say that he's going to send the military into our communities but hadn't mentioned sending a single dime of support into our communities, speaks to where we are in America,” said Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms. Much of Biden's campaign strategy centers on trying to draw a contrast with Trump on temperament and values. He has called the White House contest a battle for the soul of the nation and has been particularly forceful in condemning Trump's handling of moments of racial tension. In an election that is likely to be a referendum on the sitting president, some Biden aides say privately that the best plan may be to let Trump do himself in.Yet there is also a recognition that Biden needs to do more than simply wait for voters who may be turned off by Trump to turn toward him. Some Democrats who have criticized Biden for not being more visible during the onset of the coronavirus said he is making the right moves now.“I’m sure they have some reluctance, understandably, right now to politicize it. That's not who he is,"" said Democratic strategist James Carville. “There might be a time for eloquence, but I think that simplicity is eloquence right now.”",0.0
1622849535,2020-06-01 20:13:55,"VIDEO: Calling for justice, Black Lives Matter rally draws crowd in Twin Cities",https://www.pressherald.com/2020/06/01/video-calling-for-justice-black-lives-matter-rally-draws-crowd-in-twin-cities/,en,False,,366984,pressherald.com,http://pressherald.com/,"LEWISTON — As people started arriving Monday afternoon at Kennedy Park for a Black Lives Matter protest, 13-year-old Musdaf Said stood beside a couple of friends watching. The Lewiston Middle School student said he supported the cause that drew more than 350 people to the impromptu march to demand justice in the wake of the May 25 killing of George Floyd by police in Minnesota. “We’re getting killed for walking in the streets,” Said said. “These cops keep shooting us for dead.” In the hope of forging a better future, a racially mixed and mostly young crowd marched more than five miles through Lewiston and Auburn on Monday afternoon holding signs and chanting for justice. “For too long, black lives have been taken too early,” said Lewiston City Council member Safiya Khalid. It has to stop, she told the crowd from the steps of the police station. “No more. No more violence. No more senseless killings,” Khalid told the cheering crowd. “It has gone on for way too long.” Some of the signs held by marchers contained lists of the familiar names of black men and women who died at the hands of the police or white vigilantes. Cliff Odle, who teaches theater at Bates College, said he came because his 13-year-old daughter heard about the rally and he thought they should attend. Odle called the event “a necessary action” to give a voice to the demand for justice that is ringing throughout the country. Lewiston, he said, is not an island, but part of a whole that has seen too many die like Floyd, pinned beneath a police officer’s knee as he begged, fruitlessly, for breath. The officer has been charged with third-degree murder as authorities in Minnesota continue to investigate. Three other officers at the scene of Floyd’s death were fired. The killing has set off a surge of protests across the country that have included peaceful demonstrations by millions, as well as clashes between police and more militant protesters in many large cities and some smaller communities. Lewiston Mayor Mark Cayer, who marched along with the crowd, said he knows there is frustration and anger that he can see plainly. But, he said, he hasn’t “lived it” like so many non-white Americans, so he came to hear them. It is important, Cayer said, for the city “to provide a safe place” for the community speak. The police were eager to offer protection for the marchers, blocking off intersections and shutting down traffic as at least 350 people hoofed around Lewiston and Auburn chanting “No Justice/No Peace” and other slogans. Perhaps the most common one was a call and response, “Say his name/George Floyd” over and over, an effort to burrow his name and his death into the consciousness of the nation. The marchers set out from Kennedy Park about 3:15 p.m., headed down Chestnut Street to Lincoln Street before crossing the bridge into Auburn. Setting a brisk pace, they walked on Court Street until they reached Goff Street, proceeding to Dennison Street to Turner Street and then back across the bridge, down Lisbon Street and back to the park. Four miles in little more than an hour wasn’t quite enough. The marchers headed up Birch Street to Bartlett Street and then turned back to the park along Walnut Street. There were no serious problems for police along the route. At one point, a black man stood in front of a state police car for a minute, blocking its way, until he gave way to the pleading of other marchers to let the officer do his job. At the end of the march, a woman yelling that “All Lives Matter” drew a small crowd ready to argue, but they dispersed after a number of people urged them not to let her effort to antagonize them succeed. Odle said he was encouraged to see so many young people pushing for a more just world. His generation, he said, “dropped the ball,” but he’s determined to do what he can to create a better future for his children. As a black man, Odle said, he knows what it’s like to be pulled over by police while he’s driving or eyed suspiciously for matching some vague description of a possible criminal. It’s not how the country should be, he said. By the time the marchers reached the police station beside the park about 4:45 p.m., Khalid said she had long since lost her voice. But when offered a megaphone, she managed to get a few words out, even if most couldn’t hear them especially well. Khalid, the first elected city councilor from the Somali community in Lewiston, told them she is a black woman with black brothers. She said the country needs reform. Police need reform, Khalid added. To get the policy changes that will do the job, she said, is going to take work. “You are the change we want to see in this country,” Khalid told the crowd. “We need to get our ballots and votes,” Khalid said, and get involved in elections for local, state and national offices to make sure the best candidates win. “We have to do more,” she said. Then she asked the crowd, “What are you going to do?” The answer came loud and clear: “Vote! Vote! Vote!” Send questions/comments to the editors. « Previous Next » filed under:",0.0

On Sunday night, the twins and members of the Patriots secondary held a round table discussion on their Double Coverage Podcast. For almost an hour and 15 minutes, the McCourty’s interviewed multiple people who are actively trying to bring change. They also answered questions and discussed their own personal feelings on the ongoing racial problems in this country. ""Me and Dev just thought with everything going on in the country, we’d spend some time just to talk about it,"" Jason McCourty said in the podcast. ""Sports is obviously something that plays a huge role in our loves, but right now sports doesn’t seem like something that is very important. There’s a lot of things going on in our country from the pandemic to the racial issues that have gone on and plagued our country for hundreds and hundreds of years. We just wanted to open up our platform and be able to discuss some of these things."" This isn’t out of the ordinary for the McCourty twins. The brothers have dedicated their life to social justice causes. Their work in the community led to a nomination for the 2020 Muhammad Ali Sports Humanitarian Award, which is given to athletes who have created positive impacts in their communities. Last year, the McCourty’s along with Matthew Slater and Duron Harmon, fought to get an education bill passed in Massachusetts. In October, the Massachusetts House of Representatives and Senate unanimously passed the Student Opportunity Act. The bill will invest $1.5 billion into the states public education school system. ""That’s part of it,"" Jason McCourty said. ""When you can attack legislation and get laws and the system changed, that’s going to bring a real impact. But we can’t expect that to happen over night. It’s been hundreds of years in the process of being made the way it is."" It wasn’t long ago that peaceful protests broke out in the NFL. Started by former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick, players started to kneel during the National Anthem to bring awareness to social injustice. In 2017, following disparaging comments and tweets from President Donald Trump, Patriots players even knelt during the anthem before a game against the Houston Texans. The players were booed in Gillette Stadium for their action while people who disagreed with the action said they were disrespecting the military and country. On Sunday, Devin McCourty said it was sadly ironic that people disparaged Kaepernick while years later a black man was killed when Minneapolis, Minn., police officer Derek Chauvin knelt on his neck for 8 minutes and 46 seconds. ""Look at Kaepernick. A couple years ago, people were going crazy. ‘This guy is this, he’s that,’"" Devin McCourty said. ""Then, the irony of a man losing his life because a knee is in his neck and now, all of a sudden, people are like, oh man, let me take an extra second to listen to what Kaepernick said in an interview about why he took a knee and why he did a silent protest. ""When you listen to it, it’s like oh, that’s kind of how I feel right now after watching that video. It’s like, if you ever stopped and listen to what he was doing and his true message, it would have never got to that point and you would have never talked about the military, you would have never talked about the flag. You would’ve understood he was talking about freedom."" On the podcast, the brothers also talked with their former Rutgers teammate Chris Quaye, who is a private banker at Morgan Stanley. He talked about being an African American in a workplace where he is the overwhelming minority. Quaye, who is a part of his company’s diversity council, aims to help open doors for other minorities looking to get into the industry by educating youth.

He spoke about how he was taught that police offers were ‘bad’ and ‘dangerous’ while growing up. Lowery says he wants to ""change the narrative"" and he takes time to mentor kids. The brothers then spoke with Pat Brown, a former Rutgers wide receiver, who is the football coach at Seabreeze High School in Daytona Beach, Florida. He spoke about trying to bring student athletes together who come from different backgrounds in regards to race and family wealth. The McCourty twins also discussed about how people can invest in their community to make a difference and how a simple talk with someone can go a long way.

1622894506,2020-06-02 00:40:19,"Protesters face threats, tear gas before Trump visits church",https://www.pressherald.com/2020/06/02/protesters-face-threats-tear-gas-before-trump-visits-church/,en,False,,366984,pressherald.com,http://pressherald.com/,"WASHINGTON — It began with Attorney General Bill Barr standing with his hands casually in his pockets, not wearing a tie, surveying the scene at Lafayette Park across from the White House, where several thousand protesters had gathered for more demonstrations after the police killing of George Floyd. President Trump had announced he would soon be addressing the nation from the White House Rose Garden, as a 7 p.m. curfew in the city loomed and a mass of law enforcement, including U.S. Secret Service agents, Park Police and National Guardsmen, stood sentry, many dressed in riot gear. Moments before 6:30 p.m., just when Trump said he would begin his address, the officers suddenly marched forward, directly confronting the protesters as many held up their hands, saying, “Don’t shoot.” Soon, law enforcement officers were aggressively forcing the protesters back, firing tear gas and deploying flash bangs into the crowd to disperse them from the park for seemingly no reason. It was a jarring scene as police in the nation’s capital forcefully cleared young men and women gathered legally in a public park on a sunny evening, all of it on live television. With smoke still wafting and isolated tussles continuing in the crowd, Trump emerged in the Rose Garden for a dramatic split-screen of his own creation. “I am your president of law and order and an ally of all peaceful protesters,” he declared, before demanding that governors across the nation deploy the National Guard “in sufficient numbers that we dominate the streets.” And he warned that, if they refused, he would deploy the United States military “and quickly solve the problem for them.” As an additional show of force, Trump announced he was deploying even more of the military to Washington, D.C., giving it the feel of an armed, locked-down city after days of violent clashes, arson and looting. “As we speak I am dispatching thousands and thousands of heavily armed soldiers,” he said, as explosions rang out in the background. “We are putting everybody on warning.” Then, before departing, Trump announced he wasn’t done for the evening, and would be “going to pay my respects to a very very special place.” Moments later, the White House press pool was quickly summoned for a surprise movement. And soon after, Trump strolled out of the White House gates — something he had never done — and walked across the park that had just been cleared to accommodate his movements. Trump walked slowly, followed by an entourage of his most senior aides, security and reporters. The faint residue of pepper spray hung in the air, stinging eyes and prompting coughing. Sections of the park and surrounding sidewalks were strewn with garbage, including plastic water bottles and other debris. Some sections had been scrawled with graffiti. Trump crossed H Street and walked toward St. John’s Church, the landmark pale yellow building where every president, including Trump, has prayed. It had been damaged Sunday night in a protest fire. Trump, standing alone in front of cameras, then raised a black-covered Bible for reporters to see. “We have a great country,” Trump said. “Greatest country in the world.” He didn’t talk about Floyd, the church or the damage it had suffered, or the peaceful protesters police had cleared. He said nothing about the coronavirus pandemic, the parallel crisis that has continued to ravage the nation as Trump campaigns for a second presidential term. And then he invited his attorney general, national security adviser, chief of staff, press secretary and defense secretary — all white — to join him for another round of photos before he walked back across the park to the White House. At one point, he stopped and pumped his fist in the air at National Guard members in the distance. “We’re going to keep it nice and safe,” he said. Rabbi Jack Moline, the president of Interfaith Alliance, slammed the fact that peaceful protesters near the White House were gassed and shot with rubber bullets so Trump could hold his photo op. “Seeing President Trump stand in front of St. John’s Episcopal Church while holding a Bible in response to calls for racial justice — right after using military force to clear peaceful protesters out of the area — is one of the most flagrant misuses of religion I have ever seen,” Moline said in a statement. This only underscores the president’s complete lack of compassion for Black Americans and the lethal consequences of racism.” And the Right Rev. Mariann Budde, bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Washington, to which St. John’s belongs, said she was “outraged” by the moment and noted that Trump didn’t pray during his visit. “He took the symbols sacred to our tradition and stood in front of a house of prayer in full expectation that would be a celebratory moment,” Budde told The Associated Press. “There was nothing I could do but speak out against that.” Related Headlines Use of force criticized in protests about police brutality Send questions/comments to the editors.",0.0

1623041075,2020-06-02 03:58:41,"Here’s Something: It was the best, worst of weekends",https://www.pressherald.com/2020/06/02/heres-something-it-was-the-best-worst-of-weekends/,en,False,,366984,pressherald.com,http://pressherald.com/,"Thank goodness the SpaceX Dragon capsule made it safely off the ground to successfully dock with the International Space Station last weekend. If not for that monumental achievement, the weekend would have been one of the most tragic and depressing in American history. Similar to the opening line of Charles Dickens’ “A Tale of Two Cities,” it was truly the best of weekends due to NASA’s first manned space flight since 2011 and America’s first commercial space mission ever, with NASA teaming with Elon Musk’s SpaceX. But it was also the worst of weekends due to widespread rioting and looting in the wake of police brutality in Minneapolis. Many Americans last week watched in disbelief the video of white Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin killing black man George Floyd. We then watched with equal disbelief as angry mobs descended on the city and other cities around the country to protest, loot and burn, destroying a police precinct in the process. The average American is struck dumb by the whole episode. All we can do is appreciate the many police officers and National Guard troops around the country that are once again forming into thin blue lines to protect people and property against rioters who are accomplishing nothing but marring Floyd’s memory. We can’t thank you enough. We can’t pay you enough. We can admire you enough. You are brave heroes keeping us safe and secure. It’s during times like these we fully and humbly realize that law abiding and peace loving citizens have nothing but the police to protect them. Sorry NRA folks, no home defense shotgun or AR-15 will stop the marauding masses. Only a well-armed police or military force can do so. It’s also during times like these that we realize how fortunate we are to have brave men and women willingly patrol and defend their communities. It’s a thankless job that’s getting more thankless and dangerous as the years go by. The riots in the wake of the Floyd killing were sad for the amount of bloodshed and property damage they inflicted, but also illogical and ironic. Yes, Chauvin committed a pure act of evil, but so did the responding mobs. They revealed their own prejudice by broadly targeting rank-and-file police officers, assuming all members of the police have racial prejudice. Such is the mob mentality, though: no logic, just hate. In the end, and in the eyes of the average person, the demonstrators do themselves and their cause of racial equality a disservice by somehow equating violence with righteous retribution and believing violence will change hearts and minds. They fail to acknowledge that the vast majority of police serve and put their lives on the line because they love their communities and want the best for every inhabitant. The SpaceX mission and police response to the riots have one common thread: Both efforts required personal bravery in the face of possible injury or death. Astronauts Ben Behnken and Doug Hurley donned their spacesuits and waved goodbye to their families, braving death in pursuit of the mission. Likewise, police officers and National Guard members bravely defended not only their city streets but also the concept of civilized society. Though the rioters’ wanton destruction is the worst our society can muster, we can take pride and solace following last weekend’s tale of two Americas that we are still the home of the brave.

1623113172,2020-06-02 06:49:07,"White instigators to blame for much of mayhem, officials say",https://www.pressherald.com/2020/06/02/white-instigators-to-blame-for-much-of-mayhem-officials-say/,en,False,,366984,pressherald.com,http://pressherald.com/,"“What did I tell you?” a voice cried out as the camera recording mayhem in downtown Pittsburgh settled on a white man, clad in all black, smashing the windows of a police vehicle. “It is not black people,” the onlooker called to the crowd before addressing the vandal directly: “What are you doing?” What he was doing, authorities later alleged, was inciting riots on Saturday as the city — like dozens of others across the United States — was swept up in sustained unrest over the death of a black man in police custody. Demonstrations have spread from Minneapolis, where a white police officer pinned his knee on the neck of George Floyd, to scores of cities, some of which have been looted and set ablaze. Police identified Brian Jordan Bartels, 20, of Allison Park, Pennsylvania, as having “kicked off” the escalation in Pittsburgh, one of several examples of peaceful assemblies against police violence creating opportunities for pandemonium. While at heart the gatherings have been an appeal for racial justice, they also have attracted a diverse array of people with other grievances and agendas who have co-opted the moment, accelerating what has been a national unraveling as the country reels from a pandemic that has put more than 40 million people out of work. In most American cities, people of all races appear to be participating in the violence, vandalism and looting, particularly in Minneapolis, where a crowd burned the police department’s 3rd Precinct building last week and where vandals were seen smashing windows and stealing items from stores. Multiracial coalitions also have marched peacefully. But in some cities, local officials have noted that black protesters have struggled to maintain peaceful protests in the face of young white men joining the fray, seemingly determined to commit mayhem. In footage that spread widely online, a man identified as Bartels, who faces charges of vandalism and rioting, wore a bandanna emblazoned with the symbol of the Animal Liberation Front, a leaderless international resistance movement that pushes for animal rights. In the footage, he raised his middle fingers to black protesters who begged him to stop. At Bartels’ home in a Pittsburgh suburb, officers found spray paint and firearms, according to an arrest warrant reviewed by The Washington Post. Attempts to reach Bartels, who turned himself in to police on Monday evening, were unsuccessful. As authorities intensified their efforts to quell the uprisings – deploying tear gas and rubber bullets in aggressive spasms in many cities – police officers were joined by some elected officials and protest organizers in accusing white activists and extremists of exacerbating the chaos by blocking roadways, destroying police property and lobbing bricks into businesses. “We came together as Pittsburghers and supported a First Amendment right to gather and say more must be done,” Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto, a Democrat, told reporters over the weekend. “And then it was hijacked.” Some local officials were even more blunt. After reviewing footage of the weekend’s events, Jenny Durkan, the mayor of Seattle, said she feared the black community would shoulder the blame for havoc others caused. “It is striking how many of the people who were doing the looting and stealing and the fires over the weekend were young white males,” Durkan, a Democrat, said in an interview. President Donald Trump on Monday evening said in a Rose Garden address that he stands with demonstrators who condemn Floyd’s death. As he spoke, peaceful protesters were cleared with flash-bang explosives and tear gas so he could travel pose for a photograph in front of St. John’s Episcopal Church nearby. “These are not acts of peaceful protest; they are acts of domestic terror,” said Trump, who earlier Monday encouraged governors to “dominate” the streets with the militaristic tactics already in use in parts of the country. Violence had erupted in some of the early demonstrations starting last week, with protesters in Minneapolis setting several businesses on fire along with the police precinct. But from Baltimore to Sacramento, California, black protesters also were filmed protecting storefronts and placing their bodies before police barricades to preserve principles of nonviolence, and to prevent backlash disproportionately aimed at them. Videos emerged, too, of them confronting white demonstrators who had usurped the mantra of “black lives matter,” which gave birth to a movement for racial justice and police accountability, in seemingly random acts of defacement. “Don’t spray stuff on here when they’re going to blame black people for this,” a black woman admonished two vandals outside a Starbucks in Los Angeles. In East Liberty, a gentrifying neighborhood of Pittsburgh, a young black protester delivered a case of bottled water to a phalanx of police officers standing guard at a demonstration on Sunday outside of a Target store. “With all this stuff going on, I just wanted to spread the positivity,” said Alexander Cash, 23, who lost his job at a nearby Residence Inn because of the novel-coronavirus pandemic. “It doesn’t matter if it’s one or 45 cops standing there. I can walk up to them and still be peaceful.” That sort of caution was being undermined by intentionally destabilizing acts, warned Tim Stevens, a longtime civil rights activist in Pittsburgh. “People who do not have the social justice commitment at heart, people who really don’t care about George Floyd – they care only about an opportunity to cause disruption – how many of those people were in Pittsburgh over the weekend?” he asked. “How many were out across America?” Similar questions have become acute from Austin, Texas, where a racial justice group on Sunday canceled a planned assembly for fear of violent escalation by unaffiliated activists, to Fargo, North Dakota, where police questioned four men carrying assault rifles to a protest site in a bid to protect businesses. In Denver, police officers commandeered firearms from anti-government gun enthusiasts who self-identify as “Boogaloo boys,” part of a far-right militia movement. “These are people who are agent provocateurs,” Chas Moore, the executive director of the Austin Justice Coalition, said of the extremists joining the protests. He canceled his group’s demonstration, originally planned for Sunday, after the chaos of Saturday night. “These are extremists and anarchists, not right or left. They want complete annihilation of the system, and they’re at the forefront of the fires and the breaking of vehicles.” Others warned against tagging certain bad actors for responsibility, especially after Minnesota officials at first tried to lay blame for damage on out-of-state protesters, allegations that did not find support in arrest records. Over the weekend, Melvin Carter, the mayor of St. Paul, Minnesota, walked back comments initially asserting that “every person” detained in protests came from other states. In fact, data showed nearly all of those arrested gave addresses in Minnesota. Durkan said the age profile of those arrested in Seattle skewed young, and she pledged to examine the demographics more closely. Officials in Pittsburgh and Austin said they did not break down arrest data by race, making it difficult to discover whether claims of culpability were reflected in on-the-ground enforcement efforts. “It’s very easy for the government to create this binary of good protesters and bad protesters, and it always fits their whim,” said Rashad Robinson, the president of the racial justice group Color of Change. The dilemma, Robinson said, is how to welcome new faces to the fold without inviting chaos: “We are in a really complicated moment, and we have a lot more questions.” The complexity was deepened when Trump, with Attorney General William Barr’s backing, faulted anarchists and left-wing activists for the upheaval without providing evidence. On Monday, the president’s allies trumpeted news of the charges against Bartels, a day after the president said he would designate an anti-fascist collective known as antifa as a “terrorist organization,” though he has no apparent legal authority to do so. A former friend of Bartels who corresponded with him for several years before they had a falling out in May said Bartels never mentioned antifa, some of whose adherents favor aggressive tactics. The friend, a 17-year-old who spoke on the condition of anonymity because she feared online harassment, said Bartels was militant about veganism but otherwise espouses views that do not fall neatly along ideological lines. Another teenager who moved in the city’s pop-punk scene with Bartels said Bartels loathed establishment forces, no matter their partisan makeup. But neither understood why Bartels would have smashed a police vehicle in broad daylight, as police accuse him of doing. Similar scenes of destruction appeared in numerous cities. In downtown Austin, a crowd of several hundred protesters massed outside Austin Police Department headquarters on Sunday evening. With their numbers increasing, protesters eventually streamed over a concrete embankment and onto Interstate 35, a thoroughfare that slices Austin along racial and economic lines. The crowd was a diverse mix of black, white and Hispanic demonstrators, but it was the young white protesters who seemed to push the limits. As the crowd walked south to an exit, white protesters were spray-painting the asphalt and a concrete median. One white woman was observed applying an adhesive to a traffic cone in an attempt to adhere it to the roadway while a black protester walked by, turning his head in apparent surprise. Later in the evening, white protesters threw plastic water bottles at police, drawing rebuke from some black members of the crowd. “The police are targeting black protesters out here with rubber bullets,” said Maredith Drake, 43, who had been offering first aid to injured protesters all weekend. “We think they feel like they’ll be less accountable if they shoot a black person instead of a white one.” On Chicago’s West Side, a liquor store was looted for hours and then torched at about 9 p.m. Sunday. The air was filled with blinding smoke as Glenn Johnson, 45, stood in the doorway of his graphic design business across the street, saying he had watched looters so committed to the undertaking that they worked in crews of three, each completing a specific task. Most cars had out-of-town license plates, he said. “I don’t condone this, but I don’t condemn it,” Johnson said. “I understand where it’s coming from. But the thing is, we’re so far into this, everything is going to be gone.” Send questions/comments to the editors. « Previous Next » filed under:",0.0

David McAtee was shot and killed by law enforcement as they broke up a crowd early Monday morning in Louisville, officials said.Steve Conrad, who was Louisville Metro Police Department's chief at the time, went to the scene shortly after it happened to give details. He said the incident happened around 12:15 a.m. in the parking lot of Dino's Food Mart, located at 26th and Broadway.McAtee owned a restaurant nearby called Yaya's BBQ.Mayor Greg Fischer called McAtee a wonderful citizen, and said many knew him as ""the BBQ man.""Conrad said LMPD and the National Guard were breaking up a large group at that location when someone fired at them. Law enforcement then returned fire, police said. Police said they have several persons of interest being interviewed and it is still unclear who fired the first shot and who struck McAtee.“It’s very clear that many people do not trust the police. That is an issue we’re going to work on and work through,"" Conrad said during an early morning news conference.Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear held a news conference around noon saying to his understanding, there was significant footage of what happened, including from body cameras. He called on all of it to be released quickly.“I’m not asking people to trust our account (of what happened). I want to see the video for ourselves,” Beshear said.It was later learned that none of the LMPD officers present had their cameras activated. Two LMPD officers on the scene who police confirm were involved, Kate Crews and Allen Austin, have been put on administrative leave.The governor said he has heard the crowd at that food mart was not demonstrating at the time, but police responded because they were violating curfew.A curfew went into effect Sunday night at 9 p.m. for the whole city. That curfew has since been extended through June 8.It was an attempt by the mayor to settle unrest that has gone on for several days in the city over the Breonna Taylor case and other cases causing protests and riots across the country.Beshear also had Taylor's mother speak Monday, during which she said, ""We can't get justice with violence.""Seven people were shot the first day of protests in Louisville.

1623200720,2020-06-02 08:13:27,Inside the push to tear-gas protesters ahead of a presidential photo op,https://www.pressherald.com/2020/06/02/inside-the-push-to-tear-gas-protesters-ahead-of-a-presidential-photo-op/,en,False,,366984,pressherald.com,http://pressherald.com/,"WASHINGTON — President Trump began considering a visit to St. John’s Episcopal Church on Monday morning, after spending the night devouring cable news coverage of protests across the country, including in front of the White House. The historic church had been damaged by fire, and Trump was eager to show that the nation’s capital – and especially his own downtown swath of it – was under control. There was just one problem: the throngs of protesters, who on Monday had again assembled peacefully in Lafayette Square across from the White House to protest the death of George Floyd, an unarmed black man who died in police custody in Minneapolis last week. And so – shortly before the president addressed the nation from the Rose Garden at 6:43 p.m. Monday and roughly a half-hour before the District of Columbia’s 7 p.m. curfew went into effect – authorities fired flash-bang shells, gas and rubber bullets into the crowd, clearing a path for Trump to visit the church immediately after his remarks. The split screen as Trump began speaking was dark and foreboding – an angry leader proclaiming himself “an ally of all peaceful protesters” alongside smoke-filled mayhem and pandemonium as protesters raced for safety. The evening’s events were the product of a president who favors brute strength and fears looking weak yet finds himself reeling from a duo of crises – a deadly pandemic that has left more than 100,000 Americans dead and racial unrest that has led to protests and riots across the nation. He has also been consumed by his faltering poll numbers against former vice president Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president. When Trump had returned safely to the White House less than an hour later, the verdict seemed clear: The president had staged an elaborate photo op, using a Bible awkwardly held aloft as a prop and a historic church that has long welcomed presidents and their families as a backdrop. In the process, protesters had been tear gassed and attacked, and Trump had taken a raging conflagration and doused it with accelerant. “We long ago lost sight of normal, but this was a singularly immoral act,” said Brendan Buck, a longtime former congressional aide who is now a Republican operative. “The president used force against American citizens, not to protect property, but to soothe his own insecurities. We will all move on to the next outrage, but this was a true abuse of power and should not be forgotten.” Trump’s decision to speak to the nation from the Rose Garden and to visit the church came together earlier in the day, said one senior White House official, who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. The president was upset about news coverage of him briefly retreating to the White House bunker Friday evening amid protests, and he repeatedly wondered why anyone would have disclosed those details to the news media, two officials said. He was also frustrated by coverage this weekend of his call with the Floyd family, which he believed was positive – Trump called it “a very good call,” an official said – but was portrayed negatively. Finally, Trump was angry at cable news footage from Sunday evening, showing protests and riots near the presidential residence, a White House official said. He spent much of Monday discussing with his team how to demonstrate the streets in Washington were under control and that there would not be riotous scenes in the coming days, the official said. Inside the West Wing, aides were torn on the proposed spectacle. One official argued that it was necessary, allowing Trump to demonstrate that he was not hunkered down and was out of the White House, as well as standing with evangelical voters by visiting the church. But two others worried it could backfire. “It was just to win the news cycle,” one Trump adviser said. “I’m not sure that things are any better for us tomorrow.” Jason Miller, a former senior adviser on Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign, defended the president’s decision. He said Trump was elected in part on law-and-order themes, which he needs to continue to hammer, while simultaneously talking to black supporters about some of his initiatives, such as criminal justice reform. “You’re going to have to go and knock some of the bad guys around a little bit,” Miller said. “Once they get tear gassed or pepper sprayed, they don’t want it to happen again.” He added that Trump had been reminded by allies that he was elected as a “get-things-done president.” “He’s not the hand-holder or consoler in chief,” Miller said. “He was elected to take bold dramatic action and that’s what he did.” The action began less than an hour before the curfew, and in the moments before Trump was set to speak. Just after 6 p.m., hundreds of protesters were gathered facing Lafayette Square. Though members of the National Guard – wielding shields that said “Military Police” – were lined up behind barricades, along with Secret Service and other law enforcement officers, the protesters remained peaceful. Several played music, and one painted on an easel. Shortly thereafter, Attorney General William Barr visited the scene, and, at about 6:30 p.m., the National Guard moved just yards from the protesters, prompting some screams. Some protesters threw water bottles, but many simply stood with their arms raised. Then the chaos began. Members of the National Guard knelt briefly to put on gas masks, before charging eastward, pushing protesters down. Authorities shoved protesters with their shields, fired rubber bullets directly at them, released tear gas and set off flash-bang shells in the middle of the crowd. Protesters ran, many still with their hands up, shouting, “Don’t shoot.” Others were vomiting, coughing and crying. As Trump began to speak, some protesters took a knee several blocks from the White House, again yelling, “Hands up! Don’t shoot!” But they were never able to stay kneeling for more than a couple of minutes, because authorities kept pushing them forward, as a thick, yellow cloud of smoke hung over the crowd. About midway through his remarks, and roughly 10 minutes before the city’s curfew was set to go into effect, the president offered a stark warning: “Our 7 o’clock curfew will be strictly enforced. Those who threaten innocent life and property will be arrested, detained, and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.” Trump concluded by promising that the nation’s “greatest days lie ahead,” and then said, cryptically, “And now I’m going to pay my respects to a very, very special place. Thank you very much.” The president, accompanied by a small cadre of top advisers, then made his way over to the church. One White house official noted the lack of any black aides. Vice President Mike Pence, a leading administration official to Christian voters, was also conspicuously absent from the event at the church. Trump seemed to take in the scene and paused in front of St. John’s, turning to the cameras and holding up a black Bible in his right hand. Asked whether it was a family Bible, he said, simply, “It’s a Bible.” Some local officials were livid. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser, a Democrat, upbraided Trump on Twitter: “I imposed a curfew at 7pm. A full 25 minutes before the curfew & w/o provocation, federal police used munitions on peaceful protesters in front of the White House, an act that will make the job of @DCPoliceDept officers more difficult. Shameful! DC residents – Go home. Be safe.” The Right Rev. Mariann Budde, bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Washington, said she learned of the president’s visit by watching it on the news. “I am outraged,” she said, with pauses emphasizing her anger as her voice slightly trembled. “I am the bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Washington and was not given even a courtesy call that they would be clearing with tear gas so they could use one of our churches as a prop, holding a Bible, one that declares that God is love and when everything he has said and done is to inflame violence.” But Trump’s campaign team viewed the visit as a success. By late Monday, campaign officials were already tweeting a black-and-white photo of him walking to the church with a coterie of aides in his wake. Tim Murtaugh, the campaign’s top spokesman, posted the picture without a caption. As the curfew descended upon the nation’s capital, the scene had calmed down significantly. Trump returned to the White House, and the groups of hundreds of protesters began dispersing. Helicopters could be heard overhead all over the city Monday night, and officials said the streets were far emptier than usual. Send questions/comments to the editors. « Previous Next »",0.0

Demonstrations have spread from Minneapolis, where a white police officer pinned his knee on the neck of George Floyd, to scores of cities, some of which have been looted and set ablaze. Police identified Brian Jordan Bartels, 20, of Allison Park, Pennsylvania, as having “kicked off” the escalation in Pittsburgh, one of several examples of peaceful assemblies against police violence creating opportunities for pandemonium. While at heart the gatherings have been an appeal for racial justice, they also have attracted a diverse array of people with other grievances and agendas who have co-opted the moment, accelerating what has been a national unraveling as the country reels from a pandemic that has put more than 40 million people out of work. In most American cities, people of all races appear to be participating in the violence, vandalism and looting, particularly in Minneapolis, where a crowd burned the police department’s 3rd Precinct building last week and where vandals were seen smashing windows and stealing items from stores. Multiracial coalitions also have marched peacefully. But in some cities, local officials have noted that black protesters have struggled to maintain peaceful protests in the face of young white men joining the fray, seemingly determined to commit mayhem. In footage that spread widely online, a man identified as Bartels, who faces charges of vandalism and rioting, wore a bandanna emblazoned with the symbol of the Animal Liberation Front, a leaderless international resistance movement that pushes for animal rights. In the footage, he raised his middle fingers to black protesters who begged him to stop. At Bartels’ home in a Pittsburgh suburb, officers found spray paint and firearms, according to an arrest warrant reviewed by The Washington Post. Attempts to reach Bartels, who turned himself in to police on Monday evening, were unsuccessful. As authorities intensified their efforts to quell the uprisings – deploying tear gas and rubber bullets in aggressive spasms in many cities – police officers were joined by some elected officials and protest organizers in accusing white activists and extremists of exacerbating the chaos by blocking roadways, destroying police property and lobbing bricks into businesses. “We came together as Pittsburghers and supported a First Amendment right to gather and say more must be done,” Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto, a Democrat, told reporters over the weekend. “And then it was hijacked.” Some local officials were even more blunt. After reviewing footage of the weekend’s events, Jenny Durkan, the mayor of Seattle, said she feared the black community would shoulder the blame for havoc others caused. “It is striking how many of the people who were doing the looting and stealing and the fires over the weekend were young white males,” Durkan, a Democrat, said in an interview. President Donald Trump on Monday evening said in a Rose Garden address that he stands with demonstrators who condemn Floyd’s death. As he spoke, peaceful protesters were cleared with flash-bang explosives and tear gas so he could travel pose for a photograph in front of St. John’s Episcopal Church nearby. “These are not acts of peaceful protest; they are acts of domestic terror,” said Trump, who earlier Monday encouraged governors to “dominate” the streets with the militaristic tactics already in use in parts of the country. Violence had erupted in some of the early demonstrations starting last week, with protesters in Minneapolis setting several businesses on fire along with the police precinct. But from Baltimore to Sacramento, California, black protesters also were filmed protecting storefronts and placing their bodies before police barricades to preserve principles of nonviolence, and to prevent backlash disproportionately aimed at them. Videos emerged, too, of them confronting white demonstrators who had usurped the mantra of “black lives matter,” which gave birth to a movement for racial justice and police accountability, in seemingly random acts of defacement. “Don’t spray stuff on here when they’re going to blame black people for this,” a black woman admonished two vandals outside a Starbucks in Los Angeles. In East Liberty, a gentrifying neighborhood of Pittsburgh, a young black protester delivered a case of bottled water to a phalanx of police officers standing guard at a demonstration on Sunday outside of a Target store. “With all this stuff going on, I just wanted to spread the positivity,” said Alexander Cash, 23, who lost his job at a nearby Residence Inn because of the novel-coronavirus pandemic. “It doesn’t matter if it’s one or 45 cops standing there. I can walk up to them and still be peaceful.” That sort of caution was being undermined by intentionally destabilizing acts, warned Tim Stevens, a longtime civil rights activist in Pittsburgh. “People who do not have the social justice commitment at heart, people who really don’t care about George Floyd – they care only about an opportunity to cause disruption – how many of those people were in Pittsburgh over the weekend?” he asked. “How many were out across America?” Similar questions have become acute from Austin, Texas, where a racial justice group on Sunday canceled a planned assembly for fear of violent escalation by unaffiliated activists, to Fargo, North Dakota, where police questioned four men carrying assault rifles to a protest site in a bid to protect businesses. In Denver, police officers commandeered firearms from anti-government gun enthusiasts who self-identify as “Boogaloo boys,” part of a far-right militia movement. “These are people who are agent provocateurs,” Chas Moore, the executive director of the Austin Justice Coalition, said of the extremists joining the protests. He canceled his group’s demonstration, originally planned for Sunday, after the chaos of Saturday night. “These are extremists and anarchists, not right or left. They want complete annihilation of the system, and they’re at the forefront of the fires and the breaking of vehicles.” Others warned against tagging certain bad actors for responsibility, especially after Minnesota officials at first tried to lay blame for damage on out-of-state protesters, allegations that did not find support in arrest records. Over the weekend, Melvin Carter, the mayor of St. Paul, Minnesota, walked back comments initially asserting that “every person” detained in protests came from other states. In fact, data showed nearly all of those arrested gave addresses in Minnesota. Durkan said the age profile of those arrested in Seattle skewed young, and she pledged to examine the demographics more closely. Officials in Pittsburgh and Austin said they did not break down arrest data by race, making it difficult to discover whether claims of culpability were reflected in on-the-ground enforcement efforts. “It’s very easy for the government to create this binary of good protesters and bad protesters, and it always fits their whim,” said Rashad Robinson, the president of the racial justice group Color of Change. The dilemma, Robinson said, is how to welcome new faces to the fold without inviting chaos: “We are in a really complicated moment, and we have a lot more questions.” The complexity was deepened when Trump, with Attorney General William Barr’s backing, faulted anarchists and left-wing activists for the upheaval without providing evidence. On Monday, the president’s allies trumpeted news of the charges against Bartels, a day after the president said he would designate an anti-fascist collective known as antifa as a “terrorist organization,” though he has no apparent legal authority to do so. A former friend of Bartels who corresponded with him for several years before they had a falling out in May said Bartels never mentioned antifa, some of whose adherents favor aggressive tactics. The friend, a 17-year-old who spoke on the condition of anonymity because she feared online harassment, said Bartels was militant about veganism but otherwise espouses views that do not fall neatly along ideological lines. Another teenager who moved in the city’s pop-punk scene with Bartels said Bartels loathed establishment forces, no matter their partisan makeup. But neither understood why Bartels would have smashed a police vehicle in broad daylight, as police accuse him of doing. Similar scenes of destruction appeared in numerous cities. In downtown Austin, a crowd of several hundred protesters massed outside Austin Police Department headquarters on Sunday evening. With their numbers increasing, protesters eventually streamed over a concrete embankment and onto Interstate 35, a thoroughfare that slices Austin along racial and economic lines. The crowd was a diverse mix of black, white and Hispanic demonstrators, but it was the young white protesters who seemed to push the limits. As the crowd walked south to an exit, white protesters were spray-painting the asphalt and a concrete median. One white woman was observed applying an adhesive to a traffic cone in an attempt to adhere it to the roadway while a black protester walked by, turning his head in apparent surprise. Later in the evening, white protesters threw plastic water bottles at police, drawing rebuke from some black members of the crowd. “The police are targeting black protesters out here with rubber bullets,” said Maredith Drake, 43, who had been offering first aid to injured protesters all weekend. “We think they feel like they’ll be less accountable if they shoot a black person instead of a white one.” On Chicago’s West Side, a liquor store was looted for hours and then torched at about 9 p.m. Sunday. The air was filled with blinding smoke as Glenn Johnson, 45, stood in the doorway of his graphic design business across the street, saying he had watched looters so committed to the undertaking that they worked in crews of three, each completing a specific task. Most cars had out-of-town license plates, he said. “I don’t condone this, but I don’t condemn it,” Johnson said. “I understand where it’s coming from. But the thing is, we’re so far into this, everything is going to be gone.” « Previous Next » filed under:",0.0

When Trump had returned safely to the White House less than an hour later, the verdict seemed clear: The president had staged an elaborate photo op, using a Bible awkwardly held aloft as a prop and a historic church that has long welcomed presidents and their families as a backdrop. In the process, protesters had been tear gassed and attacked, and Trump had taken a raging conflagration and doused it with accelerant. “We long ago lost sight of normal, but this was a singularly immoral act,” said Brendan Buck, a longtime former congressional aide who is now a Republican operative. “The president used force against American citizens, not to protect property, but to soothe his own insecurities. We will all move on to the next outrage, but this was a true abuse of power and should not be forgotten.” Trump’s decision to speak to the nation from the Rose Garden and to visit the church came together earlier in the day, said one senior White House official, who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. The president was upset about news coverage of him briefly retreating to the White House bunker Friday evening amid protests, and he repeatedly wondered why anyone would have disclosed those details to the news media, two officials said. He was also frustrated by coverage this weekend of his call with the Floyd family, which he believed was positive – Trump called it “a very good call,” an official said – but was portrayed negatively. Finally, Trump was angry at cable news footage from Sunday evening, showing protests and riots near the presidential residence, a White House official said. He spent much of Monday discussing with his team how to demonstrate the streets in Washington were under control and that there would not be riotous scenes in the coming days, the official said. Inside the West Wing, aides were torn on the proposed spectacle. One official argued that it was necessary, allowing Trump to demonstrate that he was not hunkered down and was out of the White House, as well as standing with evangelical voters by visiting the church. But two others worried it could backfire. “It was just to win the news cycle,” one Trump adviser said. “I’m not sure that things are any better for us tomorrow.” Jason Miller, a former senior adviser on Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign, defended the president’s decision. He said Trump was elected in part on law-and-order themes, which he needs to continue to hammer, while simultaneously talking to black supporters about some of his initiatives, such as criminal justice reform. “You’re going to have to go and knock some of the bad guys around a little bit,” Miller said. “Once they get tear gassed or pepper sprayed, they don’t want it to happen again.” He added that Trump had been reminded by allies that he was elected as a “get-things-done president.” “He’s not the hand-holder or consoler in chief,” Miller said. “He was elected to take bold dramatic action and that’s what he did.” The action began less than an hour before the curfew, and in the moments before Trump was set to speak. Just after 6 p.m., hundreds of protesters were gathered facing Lafayette Square. Though members of the National Guard – wielding shields that said “Military Police” – were lined up behind barricades, along with Secret Service and other law enforcement officers, the protesters remained peaceful. Several played music, and one painted on an easel. Shortly thereafter, Attorney General William Barr visited the scene, and, at about 6:30 p.m., the National Guard moved just yards from the protesters, prompting some screams. Some protesters threw water bottles, but many simply stood with their arms raised. Then the chaos began. Members of the National Guard knelt briefly to put on gas masks, before charging eastward, pushing protesters down. Authorities shoved protesters with their shields, fired rubber bullets directly at them, released tear gas and set off flash-bang shells in the middle of the crowd. Protesters ran, many still with their hands up, shouting, “Don’t shoot.” Others were vomiting, coughing and crying. As Trump began to speak, some protesters took a knee several blocks from the White House, again yelling, “Hands up! Don’t shoot!” But they were never able to stay kneeling for more than a couple of minutes, because authorities kept pushing them forward, as a thick, yellow cloud of smoke hung over the crowd. About midway through his remarks, and roughly 10 minutes before the city’s curfew was set to go into effect, the president offered a stark warning: “Our 7 o’clock curfew will be strictly enforced. Those who threaten innocent life and property will be arrested, detained, and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.” Trump concluded by promising that the nation’s “greatest days lie ahead,” and then said, cryptically, “And now I’m going to pay my respects to a very, very special place. Thank you very much.” The president, accompanied by a small cadre of top advisers, then made his way over to the church. One White house official noted the lack of any black aides. Vice President Mike Pence, a leading administration official to Christian voters, was also conspicuously absent from the event at the church. Trump seemed to take in the scene and paused in front of St. John’s, turning to the cameras and holding up a black Bible in his right hand. Asked whether it was a family Bible, he said, simply, “It’s a Bible.” Some local officials were livid. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser, a Democrat, upbraided Trump on Twitter: “I imposed a curfew at 7pm. A full 25 minutes before the curfew & w/o provocation, federal police used munitions on peaceful protesters in front of the White House, an act that will make the job of @DCPoliceDept officers more difficult. Shameful! DC residents – Go home. Be safe.” The Right Rev. Mariann Budde, bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Washington, said she learned of the president’s visit by watching it on the news. “I am outraged,” she said, with pauses emphasizing her anger as her voice slightly trembled. “I am the bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Washington and was not given even a courtesy call that they would be clearing with tear gas so they could use one of our churches as a prop, holding a Bible, one that declares that God is love and when everything he has said and done is to inflame violence.” But Trump’s campaign team viewed the visit as a success. By late Monday, campaign officials were already tweeting a black-and-white photo of him walking to the church with a coterie of aides in his wake. Tim Murtaugh, the campaign’s top spokesman, posted the picture without a caption. As the curfew descended upon the nation’s capital, the scene had calmed down significantly. Trump returned to the White House, and the groups of hundreds of protesters began dispersing. Helicopters could be heard overhead all over the city Monday night, and officials said the streets were far emptier than usual. « Previous Next »",0.0

Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker said he doesn’t believe the federal government can send military troops into his state. He accused the president of creating an “incendiary moment” by threatening to do just that to quell violence that has arisen as demonstrators have taken to the streets in reaction to the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. “I reject the notion that the federal government can send troops into the state of Illinois,” Pritzker said on CNN after Trump urged governors to deploy the Guard. If they did not, he said he would send in “thousands and thousands” of soldiers. Pritzker was among the first governors to react to Trump’s comments, which came hours after the president called governors “weak” and urged them to take a more aggressive response to weekend violence. It came as Americans gathered to protest police brutality against black Americans following the killing of Floyd, who was handcuffed and on the ground pleading for air as a white police officer pressed a knee on his neck for several minutes. Some demonstrations have turned violent, with people breaking into and stealing from businesses, smashing car windows and setting fires. In New York, Gov. Andrew Cuomo has not deployed the state’s National Guard to New York City, although he said earlier Monday the state had 13,000 troops that “we can use at any moment.” “I say thank you but no thank you,” Cuomo said on CNN about Trump’s call to send military troops to the states. At least 23 states and the District of Columbia had already deployed guard troops as of Monday morning, according to a statement from the National Guard. It wasn’t clear whether the action would be enough to satisfy the president. Trump took no questions from reporters and did not say how he would decide whether a state’s response was sufficient. Democratic Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington, who has activated the state’s guard, said in a statement he prays “no soldier and no civilian is injured or killed by this reckless fit.” “This president has repeatedly proven he is incapable of governing and shown nothing but false bravado throughout the chaos that has accompanied his time in office,” Inslee said in a statement. Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak, also a Democrat, said any suggestions the state’s National Guard is ill equipped to handle the states needs is “misinformed.” “As the Commander In Chief of the Nevada National Guard I can state, categorically, that they have done their duty to protect all Nevadans, and will continue to do so.” In neighboring Oregon, Gov. Kate Brown said the violence is being perpetrated by a small segment of demonstrators. She refused to deploy the National Guard on Sunday at Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler’s request because she was concerned it would escalate a tense situation, but on Monday activated 50 unarmed guard members in support roles. “You don’t defuse violence by putting soldiers on the streets,” Brown, a Democrat, said earlier Monday in reaction to Trump’s comments about governors being weak in their response. “Trump wants governors to deploy the National Guard as a show of force to intimidate the public. I want to ensure that the public can safely raise their voices in this much-needed call for reform.” She didn’t immediately comment on Trump’s remarks about deploying the U.S. military. Nor did California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who has deployed thousands of guard troops to Los Angeles and other cities. He called Trump’s morning comments “noise” and avoided addressing them directly, although he said the nation is desperate for leadership. Guard members can assist law enforcement and perform duties such as traffic control, communications support and extinguishing fires.

They repeated George Floyd’s name again and again, adding “no justice, no peace, no racist police” and “Black Lives Matter.” “Say his name,” a voice would shout through a bullhorn. “George Floyd,” the crowd would respond. The elderly, middle-aged, all the way down to teens and babies, were there to demonstrate for George Floyd and Black Lives Matter. They filled the park, and after chanting, everyone took a knee for nine minutes, including Rockland police and Knox County Sheriff Tim Carroll. Then, the police closed off Main Street (Route 1) and the protesters marched down the road, and eventually toward the Knox County Courthouse. “We are about to get ready to march down Main Street,” shouted one of the organizers. “The police are going to block the road for us. Rockland PD and the Knox County Sheriff’s Department. So we are about to see some police cars driving by with lights. Don’t be alarmed. They are on our side and they are here to support us.” Those last words drew shouts of appreciation and applause from the crowd, before they set into motion down the road. Their placards were as personal as their personal and political reactions to the brutal death of George Floyd — “Nurses against white supremacy,” “White Silence, White Shame,” “I Can’t Breathe,” “Black Lives Matter,” “No Fascist USA,” and many more. “Everything went well here,” said Sheriff Carroll. “We support the message, as well. It’s inappropriate what happened and makes us all look bad.” There were no negative incidents at the demonstration, he said, and no threats had been received. He said the organizers may have received a few harassments. Rockland Police Chief Chris Young informed the community on the Rockland Police Department Facebook page about the rally. He wrote: We watched the coverage of George Floyd’s murder. And, like everyone else, we were disgusted and angry. We’re still angry about it. I can’t speak to what other states do in their police hiring practices and internal policies. Clearly, there are some that need dramatic reform. I can speak to how we hire officers - every full time police officer in Maine must successfully pass polygraph testing, psychological testing and cultural diversity training. Without those, they don’t become police officers. I can speak to how we train our officers, with ongoing regular training in appropriate and inappropriate uses of force. I can speak to what we believe and stand for – we believe Rockland is an open, beautiful and inclusive community; a community that we’re proud to be a part of. We stand for protecting all citizens’ rights. We stand against racism in any form. There’s an old saying, that I’d likely get wrong if I tried to directly quote it. But, essentially, it says, “The only thing needed for evil to flourish is for good people to do nothing.” There will be a rally today, for people to speak out against unjust police violence and especially George Floyd’s murder. We support any peaceful assembly, as it’s a protected citizens’ right. We enthusiastically support speaking out against racism and unjust police violence. As law enforcement, we strive to hold ourselves to a higher standard. We must begin by coming forward and condemning unjust police violence. If we remain silent in the face of injustice, we fail to protect and serve. What happened to George Floyd is despicable - it should have never happened, and should never happen again. We don’t believe in letting evil flourish. We stand with you. Chris Young, Chief of Police Reach Editorial Director Lynda Clancy at lyndaclancy@penbaypilot.com; 207-706-6657",0.0

Tim Cotton responded with a post on the department's Facebook page Tuesday morning. Protests have erupted throughout the United States and around the world for several days after Floyd, a black man, was killed by former Officer Derek Chauvin, who is white, and has since been arrested and charged. Cotton wrote in part: We, the command staff and officers of the Bangor Police Department, want to thank the ladies and gentlemen of the Brewer Police Department, and the Penobscot County Sheriff's Department for their assistance during the event; we appreciate it. We would always do the same for you. There are days when we need each other; this was one of those days. For the rest of the world, those who were not at the protest, you might have seen some online video offerings of tempers flaring and raised voices; no one was arrested. We are pleased about that. A high number of focused and calming voices were appropriately dispersed through the crowd—Maine people are good people— we know you have a high level of concern. We just appreciate the order that the majority of you brought to the protests. RELATED: Protest organizers: 'We're here for the long haul' Bangor City Councilor Angela Okafor posted a message of her own Monday night, asking people to return to their homes after the peaceful protest. Okafor focused on the positive strides that were made, encouraging protesters to continue s non-violent dialogue with police while still having their voices heard. Okafor wrote: The Peaceful protest is over. If your child or family is still out in the name of BLM protest in our Bangor, please call them or go over to the PD and pick up your child or family. We NEED EVERYONE ALIVE AND WELL FOR THE BETTER TOMORROW WE BELIEVE WE STARTED TODAY. OR AT WORST, TO FIGHT TOMORROW. We support our Cops too while we fight for justice. Our cops blockaded the street and stood there in solidarity and protection of us. I honestly was very scared going in this evening. I shared several outside contact numbers to friends. Juust in case. I fidgeted earlier on in my speech because of that. Seeing our cops and my colleagues and several of our community leaders was very helpful in calming my anxiety to a huge extent. We started a very good dialogue here. Please let us not throw it away in the hands of the instigators. I could not be more proud of our community tonight. Even two eagles flew over our gathering tonight. This was a positive action protest. And we achieved what people said we could not; a peaceful and unifying protest. We shared our truths and we listened. Please let's not allow temptation ruin our efforts and pact.

CNN reporter Omar Jimenez and his crew were arrested, live, on television, while reporting from Minneapolis. Soon it occurred again, when local TV news reporters Kaitlin Rust and James Dobson, working for WAVE 3 in Louisville, Kentucky, were targeted and shot by a policeman wielding “pepper bullets” (balls that resemble paintballs but filled with pepper spray). Then more and more reports of journalists being attacked began piling up: Outside the White House, a mob attacked a Fox News television crew, and another group of protestors attacked and beat KDKA cameraman Ian Smith in Pittsburgh. By Sunday, police attacks on reporters from MSNBC, CNN, WCCO in Minneapolis, the Los Angeles Times and other news media began flooding social media. Imagery of law enforcement assaulting journalists — even when reporters clearly identified themselves and complied fully — could be shocking, such as the attack on Vice News correspondent Michael Anthony Adams. According to U.S. Press Tracker statistics, as of May 31, more than 100 journalists had been attacked, assaulted, or arrested in less than two days. That number is certain to rise, as civil unrest continues and journalists keep reporting from chaotic locales. Every attack on a working journalist is an attempt to hide something shameful, unlawful, or embarrassing. For the police, and for some of the protestors, journalists are dangerous and must be confronted — for simply doing their jobs. “Killing the messenger” isn’t a new idea. That journalists are especially vulnerable in emotionally volatile situations has a long history. During the civil unrest in Ferguson, Missouri, in 2014, the police attacked and arrested journalists. And, as Margaret Sullivan recently pointed out in the Washington Post, the current president has spent years exploiting this vulnerability by insulting and defaming the press in ways guaranteed to rile up his supporters. The president knows the press won’t fight back, because most professional reporters continue to adhere to some version of “objective” reporting. He shrewdly exploits this professional norm — with its components of neutrality, balance, and fairness — because he understands how it restrains journalists from defending themselves. To answer back — to return fire, as it were — is to become part of the story. When a reporter becomes the subject of any storyline, the perception of their professional neutrality may be compromised. In this sense, “objectivity” becomes so constricting as to become inhumane. “Inhumane” in its most basic sense — to deny the humanity of the journalist. But journalists are human — not news-delivery automatons — and in moments when they are attacked, assaulted, and arrested, that simple fact requires recognition. When journalists are beaten, shot with rubber bullets, pepper-sprayed, and arrested without cause, they suffer the same pain and indignity endured by the subjects of their reporting. This should make them appropriately empathetic — and even sympathetic. Yet — oddly — to maintain distance and a heroic stoicism in these circumstances remains the professional ideal, following in the journalistic tradition of all those courageous reporters killed or severely wounded in the service of bringing vital reportage to the American people. When we talk of “the media” we lose sight of the individual people comprising the myriad entities jumbled together under that misleading moniker. It’s easy to attack something as diffuse and indefinite as “the media.” “The media” makes an efficient boogeyman, useful for dumping all sorts of frustration and anger. And it’s not just Donald Trump; for the disenfranchised and victims of structural inequities such as racism and poverty, “the media” can also be a pervasive and on-going part of their problem. That’s why it’s so easy for everyone to see enmity in the distanced stance and neutrality of the independent observer during these polarized, emotional times. Everyone has to choose a side — but journalists won’t. This problem is amplified by the inherent structure of journalism. It is invasive and antagonistic. It asks questions. It invades privacy. It plays both naive and skeptical at the same time. It often privileges conflict over accuracy, simply by assuming every story has at least “two sides.” Thus, by simply observing professional norms, journalists can be perceived — by law enforcement, and protestors alike — as provoking their own victimization. This is, of course, only one small component of the larger tragedy we’re all watching. But as the son of a journalist, as a former journalist, and as teacher and mentor to journalists, I’m finding it particularly painful to watch reporters being arrested and assaulted for simply doing their job professionally. Too often we forget that it’s honorable work done in service to the citizenry, and without these sacrifices we would be far less well-informed. And too often we forget that journalists are human, too. Michael J. Socolow, an associate professor of journalism and communication, will become the director of the University of Maine’s McGillicuddy Humanities Center in July.

1623351718,2020-06-02 08:09:10,Trump to visit Maine manufacturer of coronavirus testing swabs,https://www.seacoastonline.com/news/20200601/trump-to-visit-maine-manufacturer-of-coronavirus-testing-swabs?rssfeed=true,en,True,,658823,State News - United States - Maine,http://www.maine.statenews.net/,"GUILFORD, Maine (AP) — President Donald Trump is paying a visit to Maine on Friday to a manufacturer of specialized swabs used in testing for the coronavirus. Puritan Medical Products, which is one of only two major manufacturers of the swabs, is in the process of opening a second production site with a goal of roughly doubling monthly production from 21.6 million swabs per month to 40 million per month by August or September. The Trump administration is providing $75.5 million through the Defense Production Act to boost production. The Guilford-based company hopes to have the second production facility in Pittsfield running by July 1. Word of the visit came during a discussion between Trump and governors Monday following a weekend of demonstrations, some violent, following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Maine Gov. Janet Mills expressed concerns about ""security problems"" in light of the racial unrest. She asked the president about intelligence on protesters that he said he possessed. About 300 people in Maine's largest city marched on Sunday, blocking traffic and leaving graffiti at the police headquarters. But that was mild in comparison to destruction caused by protests elsewhere around the country. Demonstrators were outraged by video that showed Floyd was pinned to pavement by a police officer who put his knee on the handcuffed black's man neck. He was later pronounced dead at a hospital. Trump urged governors to crack down on protesters: ""You've got to arrest people, you have to track people, you have to put them in jail for 10 years and you'll never see this stuff again.""

But several states and the District of Columbia have primaries up and down the ballot: Indiana, Iowa, Maryland, Montana, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and South Dakota. Pennsylvania is holding primary voting on Tuesday, though Gov. Tom Wolf extended the deadline for voting by mail by one week, until June 9. Here are the races to watch. Live results will appear Tuesday evening. Presidential primaries press on. Former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee, has not yet officially clinched the nomination. He went into the day 425 delegates short of the magic number of 1,991. With 500 delegates at stake Tuesday, he needs 85% of the delegates up for grabs, which he's unlikely to get. More likely, Biden will cross the threshold next week, June 9, when Georgia and West Virginia vote, with their 133 delegates at stake (and when we'll get the results of Pennsylvania's primary, with its 186 delegates). Rep. Steve King on the ropes. The controversial Iowa conservative faces real danger in his primary for reelection from Iowa's 4th Congressional District. After racist and pro-white nationalist remarks, much of the Republican establishment abandoned King. They've come for him before in his almost 20 years in Congress unsuccessfully. But this has been their best chance so far. King has trailed in the polls, with only $30,000 cash on hand and no TV ads running. The favorite among his challengers has been state Sen. Randy Feenstra, who has painted King as ineffective in the House, given that he was stripped of key committee assignments. But King is well known as a familiar choice for conservatives in western Iowa and has been resilient. Polls close at 10 p.m. ET Loading... In Iowa's 2nd Congressional District, Democratic Rep. Dave Loebsack is retiring, opening up his seat. Former state Sen. Rita Hart will be the Democratic nominee and will face either state Sen. Mariannette Miller-Meeks or ex-Illinois Congressman Bobby Schilling, who moved to Iowa in 2017. Miller-Meeks got the backing of Gov. Kim Reynolds and Sen. Joni Ernst, as well as House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. Former Sen. Rick Santorum and Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, a top Trump ally, have backed Schilling. Polls close at 10 p.m. ET Loading... Steny Hoyer faces a challenge from the left. A veteran lawmaker from Maryland's 5th Congressional District and No. 2 in House Democratic leadership, Hoyer faces a progressive primary challenge from 29-year-old Mckayla Wilkes. Wilkes, a single mother, was inspired by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's victory in New York in 2018 over another veteran white male Democratic leader. Wilkes raised $300,000 and said Hoyer, who has been in Congress almost 40 years, is out of touch with the district. The Democratic establishment has remained behind Hoyer, though, including the Congressional Black Caucus, which endorsed him. He has outspent Wilkes $2.7 million to $237,000. Polls close at 8 p.m. ET Loading... Spy games in New Mexico. The announced retirement of New Mexico Sen. Tom Udall set off a domino effect. Democratic Rep. Ben Ray Luján declared for Udall's Senate seat, leaving open his seat in the 3rd Congressional District. Enter: Valerie Plame, the ex-CIA agent. She has raised and spent more than any candidate in this race and gained national attention with her glossy campaign ad showing her racing backward in a Chevy Camaro on a dusty road. But locally, her candidacy has looked less like an easy Sunday drive. She faced criticism for being a relative newcomer, moving to the area in 2007; the district is 41% Latino and 19% Native American, and another candidate, Teresa Leger Fernandez, got the endorsements of the political arm of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and EMILY's List. Polls close at 9 p.m. ET Loading... It is very possible that New Mexico sends an all-female House delegation to Congress in 2021, as freshman Democrats Deb Haaland and Xochitl Torres Small are the incumbents in the state's other two districts. But Torres Small has to win what's expected to be a tough reelection race in the 2nd District. Trump won there by 10 points in 2016, and the primary to decide who will take on Torres Small this fall is a contest between two Republican women. It has been a nasty primary between Yvette Herrell, the 2018 nominee, and Claire Chase, an oil executive. Both have campaigned on who's the most pro-Trump; Herrell got the backing of the House Freedom Caucus, but Chase has outraised and outspent Herrell, with support from Defending Main Street, a group with ties to establishment Republicans. Polls close at 9 p.m. ET Loading... Senate matchups to be set in Iowa and Montana. Democrats are hoping to take back the Senate this fall. They have an outside shot at that right now, but their odds have looked increasingly better of late. Partially, that's because of these two races. In Iowa, Democrats are targeting incumbent Republican Joni Ernst, but first there's the primary Tuesday. The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee has backed real estate executive Theresa Greenfield in the four-way contest. Greenfield raised $7.1 million and went into Tuesday as the favorite. Other Democrats include retired Adm. Mike Franken, attorney Kimberly Graham and Eddie Mauro, a businessman and former teacher and coach who has spent the second most — $1.4 million — on this primary. Polls close at 10 p.m. ET Loading... When Montana Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock changed his mind and decided to challenge incumbent Republican Sen. Steve Daines, it suddenly put this race on the map for Democrats in a big way.

In Portland it was the fourth day of protests over the killing. The mostly young demonstrators were clad in black and wearing masks due to the COVID-19 pandemic. They carried signs saying ""Black Lives Matter"" and ""No Justice, No Peace."" Floyd died in police custody after a white police officer pressed his knee into Floyd's neck while he was handcuffed and saying that he couldn't breathe. In a symbolic reenactment of that event, hundreds of the protesters lay down with their hands behind their backs in front of the Portland Police Station. The demonstrators vowed to keep up their daily protests until police stop removing their informal memorials. Monday night, hundreds of signs were put up in front of the police station, including on the stairs leading to the main entrance. Protestors had hoped Portland Police Chief Frank Clark would come out and address them, but he didn't before the crowd largely dispersed. Later, after what had been a peaceful event, protestors blocked several intersections and surrounded two police cruisers, the Portland Press Herald reports. At one point, 25 officers in riot gear were pelted with water bottles and other items as they cleared the intersection of Franklin and Middle Streets. Meanwhile, in Bangor the group Racial Equity and Justice mobilized hundreds who gathered peacefully in the city's downtown. Protester Scarlett Furrow said she hopes the demonstrations help people understand that systemic racism affects everyone, and that they'll motivate police to take responsibility for other police. ""If good cops don't speak up about bad cops, everyone is a bad cop,"" Furrow said. Earlier the Bangor Police Department and the local NAACP released a joint statement condemning the Minnesota police officer's actions. At the end of the Bangor demonstration, some protesters and Bangor police officers knelt down together and shook hands. Hundreds more protesters demonstrated peacefully in Lewiston, marching five miles into neighboring Auburn before returning to Kennedy Park, according to the Lewiston Sun Journal. Similar protests were held in Waterville, Rockland and Farmington. Meanwhile, former Minneapolice police officer Derek Chauvin has been arrested and charged with murder. Three other officers at the scene during Floyd’s death were fired by the Minneapolis police department but have not been charged. Kevin Bennett contributed to this story.",0.0

The upbraiding from the White House didn't sit well with many governors, who have been busy responding to clashes between protesters and law enforcement in dozens of U.S. cities sparked by the death a week ago of George Floyd after a Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck. Trump took a tough line with the governors, saying he was putting Attorney General William Barr in charge of the federal law enforcement response. The president said the White House was ""strongly looking for arrests."" ""You have to arrest people and you have to try people. And they have to go to jail for long periods of time,"" the president said. ""If people are running amok, you have to dominate. If you aren't dominating, you're wasting your time,"" he said. ""They're going to run over you; you're going to look like a bunch of jerks."" ""It's a movement. If you don't put it down, it will get worse and worse,"" Trump said. ""The only time it's successful is when you're weak and most of you are weak."" The call followed yet another night of unrest Sunday over the May 25 death of Floyd and came on the same day that the president in a Rose Garden address urged governors deploy National Guard troops to quell the unrest. ""If a city or state refuses to take the actions that are necessary to defend the life and property of their residents, then I will deploy the United States military and quickly solve the problem for them,"" he said. In the nation's capital, where U.S. Secret Service uniformed officers, military police and other law enforcement on Monday fired tear gas on peaceful protesters outside of the White House, Trump said he was already ""dispatching thousands and thousands of heavily armed soldiers, military personnel and law enforcement officers to stop the rioting, looting, vandalism, assaults and the wanton destruction of property."" While some governors, such as South Carolina's Henry McMaster, a Republican, praised Trump's calls for a crackdown, others took umbrage at the president's combative tone and questioned his authority to unilaterally deploy federal troops to the states. During the conference call, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, a Democrat, warned the president that the ""rhetoric coming out of the White House is making it worse,"" to which Trump snapped back, ""I don't like your rhetoric that much either."" ""I had to speak up, and I told him that his rhetoric is inflaming matters, that it's making things worse, and that we need to call for police reform,"" Pritzker told NPR's Morning Edition on Tuesday. ""We need to call for calm, that that's what the president should do and we need national leadership in this regard."" ""He unfortunately — you know,"" the governor added, ""he reacted badly."" Pritzker also said that what Trump's suggesting is ""illegal."" ""The governor of a state has to ask for federal help. I don't know any governor that intends to do that,"" he said. ""And secondly, you know, you can hear in his rhetoric that he is simply trying to make himself sound like a strong man — almost like a dictator, as if he's going to be responsible for bringing order all the way."" In Michigan, where police and protesters have skirmished in Grand Rapids despite many demonstrations remaining peaceful, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, called the president's remarks ""dangerous"" and said they should be ""gravely concerning to all Americans."" The president's comments, she said, ""send a clear signal that this administration is determined to sow the seeds of hatred and division, which I fear will only lead to more violence and destruction."" ""We must reject this way of thinking. This is a moment that calls for empathy, humanity, and unity,"" Whitmer said in a statement. ""This is one of the most challenging periods in our nation's history, but as Americans, we must remember our enemy is racial injustice, not one another."" The Republican governor of Massachusetts, Charlie Baker, said he wasn't surprised by the president's ""incendiary words."" ""At so many times during these last several weeks, when the country needed compassion and leadership the most, it simply was nowhere to be found,"" he said following the phone call with Trump. ""Instead, we got bitterness, combativeness and self-interest. That's not what we need in Boston, it's not what we need right now in Massachusetts,"" he said as his voice cracked with emotion, ""and it's definitely not what we need across this great country of ours either."" Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, a Democrat, called the president's remarks the ""rantings of an insecure man trying to look strong after building his entire political career on racism."" On the subject of the deploying of federal troops, Democratic New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo told CNN that he would respond to such an offer by saying, ""Thank you, but no thank you."" ""He wants to make this about looting because he doesn't want to talk about the killing of Mr. Floyd,"" Cuomo said. ""[He] doesn't want to really talk about racism and discrimination."" Kentucky Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear was reportedly not on the call with the president. Beshear was instead talking with the mother of Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old African American resident of Louisville who was killed in March by police executing a no-knock warrant. The president did praise one Democratic governor for his response to the unrest — Minnesota's Tim Walz, who fully mobilized National Guard troops on Saturday to supplement law enforcement. But at another point in the call, Trump called Minnesota ""a laughingstock all over the world."" Walz said Monday that he responded by saying: ""No one's laughing here. We're in pain. We're crying. We saw a man lose his life in front of them and our challenge is that this is about social trust, social compacts and reestablishing faith in the people who are there to serve them.""

Many cities imposed curfews, and President Trump again warned he would order active duty military forces to restore order if state and local governments, in his judgement, failed to do so. Here are details of some protests around the country. St. Louis Four police officers were shot and wounded during another night of unrest in St. Louis, according to the city's police chief, John Hayden. In an emotional news conference, Hayden said the officers were hurt in an incident downtown following a day of peaceful protests that drew thousands into the city's streets. He said a couple hundred people ""with no intention of protesting or doing anything constructive"" remained late into the night, looting, vandalizing and throwing objects at police officers. Just after midnight, shots were fired at a line of officers, striking two in the leg, one in the foot and another in the arm, he said. Hayden said none of the injuries were life-threatening. Hayden called Floyd's death tragic but said what was happening in St. Louis was ""mayhem."" ""They're throwing fireworks on officers, fireworks were exploding on officers,"" he said. ""They had officers that had gas poured on them. And you try to figure out what is going on. How can this be?"" Las Vegas There were a pair of shootings overnight in Las Vegas, one of which left a police officer hospitalized and ""in grave condition,"" according to Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Sheriff Joseph Lombardo. The first incident took place in front of the famed Circus Circus Hotel and Casino as police said they were working to disperse protesters. Lombardo said rocks and bottles were being hurled at police. ""Officers were attempting to get some of the protesters in custody when a shot rang out and our officer went down,"" he said during an early Tuesday morning press briefing. The unnamed officer was transported to a local hospital and is in critical condition, he said. A suspect is in custody. The other incident took place shortly before midnight on Monday, when LVMPD and federal officers were guarding the Foley Federal Building and U.S. courthouse. Lombardo said police encountered a man ""who was armed with multiple firearms and appeared to be wearing body armor."" Then, ""officers engaged him"" and ""the suspect was struck by gunfire,"" Lombardo said. He was later pronounced dead. It is unclear if the man was taking part in the protests prior to his deadly encounter with police. Investigations into both incidents are ongoing. ""With these protests, which are leading to riots, one tragedy is only leading to another,"" Lombardo said. ""What has occurred is utterly unacceptable. I hope the community sees it that way too."" Omaha, Neb. Protesters gathered in downtown Omaha on Monday for the third consecutive night after Douglas County Attorney Donald Kleine ruled that a white bar owner who shot and killed a 22-year-old black Omaha protester on Saturday acted in self-defense. Protesters carried signs with slogans such as ""Hands up — don't shoot"" and chanted ""Black lives matter,"" according to Megan Feeney, a freelance journalist reporting for NPR member station NET in Omaha. ""A lot of black leaders were saying, 'Don't go downtown tonight, we need to reconsider our approach, think about how we can reorganize and want to avoid any useless violence, pain and potential death,' "" Feeney said. After the start of an 8 p.m. curfew, the protest had shrunk considerably, according to Feeney, and military vehicles blocked streets adjacent to the demonstration. ""Police started to advance and people started running. They ran down an alley, got blocked and some in the crowd started to throw water bottles and other objects while others yelled to stop,"" Feeney said. ""Officers started closing in from all four directions and nobody could leave."" The Omaha Police Department reported two firearms arrests as well as an unspecified number of arrests for curfew violations. New York New York City imposed an 11 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew Monday. Mayor Bill de Blasio announced the curfew would begin Tuesday at 8 p.m. Protests were largely peaceful, though some looting was reported at a few luxury retailers, including Macy's flagship store in Manhattan. In Buffalo, a city police officer and New York state trooper were struck by an SUV during a protest. The law enforcement officers were not seriously injured. It was unclear whether the driver intentionally struck the officers. ~~~~~https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Freecereports%2Fstatus%2F1267629669093978117https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2FAliWatkins%2Fstatus%2F1267654230183227393https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fnyspolice%2Fstatus%2F1267655485278339072~~~~~~ Los Angeles In Los Angeles, where some 700 people were arrested on Sunday, there was a heavy police presence in Hollywood and Van Nuys amid multiple protests, mostly peaceful. But looting and vandalism in some areas along Van Nuys Boulevard prompted a response from officers, who fired bean bags. Authorities also responded to a fire at a strip mall, according to the Los Angeles Times. San Francisco Bay Area Some 15,000 people marched peacefully in downtown Oakland, according to a police spokesperson quoted in the East Bay Times. Most dispersed prior to the start of the city's 8 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew. More than 40 people were arrested for violating the curfew, according to the Oakland Police Department. The Alameda County Sheriff's office tweeted late Monday, ""Over 100 people arrested so far. It is time to go home."" In nearby Walnut Creek, several hundred protesters, mostly teenagers and young people, walked onto Interstate 680, according to the East Bay Times. Police in riot gear ordered them to disperse before chasing them with dogs, firing tear gas and rubber bullets, the newspaper said. Police said some protesters had vandalized a handful of vehicles, according to NPR member station KQED. More than a dozen San Francisco Bay Area jurisdictions have imposed curfews in the wake of protests sparked by Floyd's death. Corrections: 6/02/20 A previous version of this story incorrectly reported that 15,000 people marched on Interstate 680 in Walnut Creek, Calif., and were dispersed by police. The correct figure is several hundred. The march by 15,000 people was peaceful and took place in Oakland, Calif.",0.0

Thanks for hospitality. Teoh. All the elected officials that air here bring ingredients. I can't breathe. I can't breathe. George floors last words, but they didn't die with him. You're still being heard going all across this nation. They speak to a nation where too often, just the color of your skin put your life at risk. They speak to the nation were more than 100,000 people have lost their lives a virus and 40 million have filed for unemployment. With the disproportionate number of those deaths and job losses concentrated black and brown communities, they speak to a nation where every day millions of people and millions not at the moment of losing their life but in the course of living their life are saying to themselves, I can't breathe. It's a wake up call to our nation. In my view, it's for all of us, and I mean all of us. It's not the first time we've heard those words. They're the same words we heard from Eric Garner when his life was taken away six years ago. But it's time to listen to those words, to try to understand, to respond to him respond with action. A country is crying out for leadership leadership that can you. Nine US leadership That brings us together. Leadership that could recognize pain and deep grief of communities that have had a knee on the neck for a long time. There's no place for violence, no place for looting or destroying property or burning churches. There's during businesses. Many have been built by the very people of color who are first time in their lives, are beginning to realize their dreams and bill wealth for their families. Nor is it acceptable for police sworn to protect and serve all people escalate tension, resort to excessive violence, way need to distinguish between legitimate peaceful protests and opportunistic, violent destruction. We have to be vigilant about the violence that's being done by this incumbent president, to our economy and to the pursuit of justice. Would peaceful protesters dispersed in order for a president, a president from the doorstep of the People's House, the White House, using tear gas and flash grenades in order to stage a photo op? A photo of one of the most historic churches in the country, or at least in Washington, D. C. We can be forgiven for believing the president's more interesting in power, then in principle were just serving the passions of his based on the needs of the people in his care, for that's what the presidency is, the duty to care, to care for all of us, not just those who vote for us, but all of us, not just our donors, but all of us. The president held up the Bible at ST John's Church. I just wish he opened it once in a while, said a brandishing. If he opened it, he could have learned something. They're all called love one another as we love ourselves. It's really hard work, but it's the work of America. Donald Trump is interested in doing that work. Instead, he's preening and sweeping away all the guard rails. Lo have protected our democracy guard rails. I helped make possible this nation's path to a more perfect union, a union that constantly requires reform and rededication. And, yes, the protest from voices that are mistreated, ignored, left out or left behind. But it is a union you worth fighting for. That's why I'm running for pressure. In addition of the Bible, the president might also want open the U. S. Constitution. If he did, he'd find a thing called the First Amendment What it says, Beginning says the right of the people peaceably to assemble and to petition their government for redress of grievances. That's kind of an essential motion building into this country, Mr President. That's America. That's America. No horses rising up on their hind legs to push back peaceful protests, not using the American military to move against the American people. This is a nation of values. Our freedom to speak is a cherished knowledge that lives inside every American. Almost from the time your kids we're gonna allow any president to quiet our voice. We won't let those who see this is an opportunity to sow chaos. Throw up a smokescreen to distract us and very really religion legitimate grievances. At the heart of these protests, we can We can't leave this moment. I can't leave this moment thinking that we can once again turn away and do nothing. Can't do that this time. We just can't. The moment has come for our nation to deal with systemic graces to deal with the growing economic inequity that exists in our nation to deal with the denial of the promise of this nation made to so many. No, I've said from the outset of this election that were in the battle for the soul of this nation. We are in the battle for the soul of a nation. What we believe, maybe most importantly, who we want to be. It's all steak that's sure today than it's ever been leased in my lifetime. And it's this urgent. It's in the services we can find a path forward. Now the history of this nation teaches us that is some of our darkest moments of despair. We've made some of our greatest progress somewhere. Darkest moment. 13 14 15th Amendments follow the Civil War The greatest economic growth in world history grew out of the Great Depression. Civil Rights Act of 1964 and 65. Voting Rights Act of 65 came in the tracks of Bull Connor's vicious dogs. Prior phrase Reverend Barber. It's the morning we find hope. It's in the morning. We find hope when we more it's gonna take more than talk. Had talked before, read protest before we've got a now vowed to make this at least in their of action and reverse the systemic racism with a long overdue concrete changes. The action will not be completed in the 1st 100 days of my presidency. If I'm fortunate to be elected or even in my entire term, it's gonna take the work of a generation. But if this agenda will take time to complete, it should not wait for the 1st 100 days of my presidency to get started. A down payment, What is long overdue should come now should come immediately. I call in the Congress to act this month on measures that would be the first step in this direction, starting with real police reform. Congressman Jeffries has a bill to outlaw. Joe calls. Congress should put it on the president's desk in the next few days. The other measures to stop transferring weapons of war to police forces improve oversight and accountability to create a model use of force standard that also should be made long this month. No more excuses, no delays. If Mitch McConnell can bring in the United States Senate to confirm Trump's on qualified judicial nominees who will run roughshod over our constitution now it's time to pass legislation will give true meaning to our constitutional promise of equal protection under the law. Looking ahead, in the 1st 100 days of my presidency, I've committed to creating a national police oversight Commission. I've long believed we need riel community policing. We need each and every police Department of Country to understand a comprehensive review of the undertaking conference review of their hiring, their training de escalation. Some have already done it somehow are in the process of doing it. The federal government should give give the cities and states the tools and the resources they need to implement reforms. More police officers meet the higher standards of the procession. Most of them do it all. The more reason why bad cops should be dealt with severely and swiftly. We all need to take a hard look at the culture allows for the senseless tragedies to keep happening. We need to learn from the cities in the precincts that are getting it right. We know though we have in order to have true American justice, we need economic justice as well. Here, too, is there's much to be done. As a media step. Congress should act should act now to rectify racial inequities that allow Cove in 19 recovery funds to be diverted from where they live. I'll be setting forth my Jenna and economic justice and opportunity in the weeks and months ahead. But it begins with health care. Health care should be a right, not a privilege of the quickest route to universal coverage of this country's expand on Obama care. We could do it. We should do it. But this president, even now in the midst of a public health crisis with massive unemployment, well want to destroy it. He doesn't care how many millions Americans will be hurt because he's consumed with his blind. Any go when it comes to Barack Obama. President Obama. The presidency would draw his lawsuit to strike down Obamacare, and the Congress should prepare to pass the act. I proposed to expand Obama care to millions Mawr. So everyone's covered his last words. We've seen America's true heroes health care workers, docks, nurses, delivery truck drivers, grocery store workers. You know, we've come up with new phrase from essential workers. Essential worker way need to do more than praise them. We need to pay them. We need to pay them because we weren't clear before. It's clear now. This country wasn't built by Wall Street bankers and CEOs was built by the great American middle class, which is built by unions and are essential workers. You know, I know there's enormous fear and uncertainty and anger in the country. I understand. I know so many Americans are suffering, suffering, loss of a loved one. So for an economic hardship, wondering, can I feed my family tomorrow? What's gonna have suffering under the weight of a generation after generation after generation, I've heard inflicted on people of color black brown in native communities in particular. Like many of you, I know what it means. Degree. My losses are not the same as loss is felt by so many. But I know what it feels like when you think you can't go on. I know what it means to have that black hole in your chest where your grief is being sucked into it. Just a few days ago, mark the fifth anniversary of my son most passing. There are still moments when the pain is so great it feels no different than the day I sat in that bed as he passed away. But I also knew, but the best way to bear loss and pain to turn it into that anger and anguish in the purpose. And Americans know what our purposes is a nation. It has to be guided. Mr. Guided guided us from the very beginning. No, it's been reported the day that President John F. Kennedy was assassinated. Little Yolanda King came home from school in Atlanta and jumped in her daddy's arms, said, Oh, Daddy, she said, Now we're never going to get our freedom. Daddy was reassuring, Strong, brave. He said, No, don't worry, baby. It's gonna be OK. It's gonna be all right. Amid the violence and fear, Dr King persevered. He was driven by his dream of a nation where justice runs down like water and righteousness like a mighty stream. Then 19 68. Hate cut him down in Memphis two days before Dr Key was murdered. Hey gave a final Sunday sermon to Washington. No, he told us that though the arc of the moral universe is long said, it bends towards justice and we know we can bend it because we have. We have to believe that still, that's our purpose. It's been our purpose in the very beginning, to become a nation where all men and women are not only creating, but they're treated equally, not just credited, would treated equally to become a nation to find, in Dr King's words, not only by the absence of tension before the presence of justice, I'm not just a not attention but justice. Today in America, it's hard to keep faith the justices hated. I know that, you know pain is raw, the pain is really president of states must be part of the solution, not the problem. But this president today is part of the problem and accelerates. When you treated the words when the looting starts, the shooting starts. They weren't the words present. Their words of a racist Miami police chief in the sixties when he tweeted the protesters quote, would have been greeted with the most vicious dogs when people would have been really hurt. End of quote. They weren't the words of a president. They were the kind of words Bull Connor would have used, unleashing his dogs on innocent women and Children. You know, the American story is a story about action and reaction that's actually works. We can't be naive about it. I wish I could say that Hate began with Donald Trump will. And with him it didn't and it won't. American history is in a fairy tale with a guaranteed happy ending. The battle for the soul of this nation has been a constant push and pull for more than 240 years, a tug of war between the American ideal that we're all created equal in the harsh reality that racism has long torn us apart. The honest truth is that both elements are part of the American character, both elements at our best. The American ideal wins out, but it's never around. It's always a fight, and the battle is never fully one. But we can't ignore the truth that we're at our best when we open our hearts rather than clinch our fish. Donald Trump has turned this country in a battlefield driven by old resentments and fresh fears. He thinks division helps him. His narcissism has become more important than the nation's well being that he leads. I ask every American I mean this in the bottom, or ask every American look at where we are now and thinking new. Is this who we are? Is this what we want to be? Is this you want to pass on to our Children and our grandchildren? Fear, anger, finger pointing, rather the pursuit of happiness, incompetence and anxiety, self absorbed selfishness? Or do we want to be the America we know? We can be American. We know in our hearts we could be and should be. Look, I look at the presidency as a very big job and nobody we'll get it right every time. And I won't either. But I promise you this. I won't traffic in fear and division. I won't fan the flames of hate. I'll seek the heal, the racial wounds that have long plagued our country, not used them for political gain. I'll do my job and I will take responsibility. I won't blame others. I'll never forget. I will never forget. I promise you, this job is not about me. It's about you. It's about us work now gone to rebuild the nation, but build it better than it was. We're the only nation of the world that goes through a crisis and comes out better to build a better future That's what America does to build a better future. We build the future. It may in fact, be the most American thing to do. Build the future. We hunger for liberty the way Harriet Tubman and Frederick Douglass did. We thirst for the vote like Susan B. Anthony and Ella Baker and John Lewis. Did we strive to explore the stars, cure disease, make an in perfect union more perfect than has been? We may come up short, but at our best we try. My fellow Americans were facing a formidable enemies. They include not only the Corona virus and the table impact on the lives and livelihoods, but also the selfishness and fear that have loomed over our national life for the last three years. I choose those words advisedly, selfishness and fear. Defeating those enemies requires us to do our duty, and that duty includes remembering who we should be, who we should be. We should be the America of F. D. R. And Eisenhower of Rosa Parks and Martin Luther King Jr. Jonah Salt. Neil Armstrong. We should be the America that cherishes life, liberty and courage, and above all, we should be in America that chairs each other each and every one of us. You know, we're a nation in pain. We must let let our pain destroys. We're nation and raged. We can not our rage consume us. We're a nation. It's exhausted. But we will not allow our exhaustion to fetus as presidents. My commitment to all of you to lead on these issues and to listen because I truly believe in my heart of hearts we can't overcome. We stand together. Finally, is one America. We'll rise stronger than we were before. We'll move that art closer to justice. We'll reach out to one another for speak out for one another. And please, please do what's recently been happening. Take care of one another. This is the United States of America. There's never been anything we've been unable to do when we set our mind to do it. We've done it together together, united. That's we are at our best. God bless you all. May God protect our troops que Mr Mayor. Thanks for hospitality. Teoh. All the elected officials that air here bring ingredients. I can't breathe. I can't breathe. George floors last words, but they didn't die with him. You're still being heard going all across this nation. They speak to a nation where too often, just the color of your skin put your life at risk. They speak to the nation were more than 100,000 people have lost their lives a virus and 40 million have filed for unemployment. With the disproportionate number of those deaths and job losses concentrated black and brown communities, they speak to a nation where every day millions of people and millions not at the moment of losing their life but in the course of living their life are saying to themselves, I can't breathe. It's a wake up call to our nation. In my view, it's for all of us, and I mean all of us. It's not the first time we've heard those words. They're the same words we heard from Eric Garner when his life was taken away six years ago. But it's time to listen to those words, to try to understand, to respond to him respond with action. A country is crying out for leadership leadership that can you. Nine US leadership That brings us together. Leadership that could recognize pain and deep grief of communities that have had a knee on the neck for a long time. There's no place for violence, no place for looting or destroying property or burning churches. There's during businesses. Many have been built by the very people of color who are first time in their lives, are beginning to realize their dreams and bill wealth for their families. Nor is it acceptable for police sworn to protect and serve all people escalate tension, resort to excessive violence, way need to distinguish between legitimate peaceful protests and opportunistic, violent destruction. We have to be vigilant about the violence that's being done by this incumbent president, to our economy and to the pursuit of justice. Would peaceful protesters dispersed in order for a president, a president from the doorstep of the People's House, the White House, using tear gas and flash grenades in order to stage a photo op? A photo of one of the most historic churches in the country, or at least in Washington, D. C. We can be forgiven for believing the president's more interesting in power, then in principle were just serving the passions of his based on the needs of the people in his care, for that's what the presidency is, the duty to care, to care for all of us, not just those who vote for us, but all of us, not just our donors, but all of us. The president held up the Bible at ST John's Church. I just wish he opened it once in a while, said a brandishing. If he opened it, he could have learned something. They're all called love one another as we love ourselves. It's really hard work, but it's the work of America. Donald Trump is interested in doing that work. Instead, he's preening and sweeping away all the guard rails. Lo have protected our democracy guard rails. I helped make possible this nation's path to a more perfect union, a union that constantly requires reform and rededication. And, yes, the protest from voices that are mistreated, ignored, left out or left behind. But it is a union you worth fighting for. That's why I'm running for pressure. In addition of the Bible, the president might also want open the U. S. Constitution. If he did, he'd find a thing called the First Amendment What it says, Beginning says the right of the people peaceably to assemble and to petition their government for redress of grievances. That's kind of an essential motion building into this country, Mr President. That's America. That's America. No horses rising up on their hind legs to push back peaceful protests, not using the American military to move against the American people. This is a nation of values. Our freedom to speak is a cherished knowledge that lives inside every American. Almost from the time your kids we're gonna allow any president to quiet our voice. We won't let those who see this is an opportunity to sow chaos. Throw up a smokescreen to distract us and very really religion legitimate grievances. At the heart of these protests, we can We can't leave this moment. I can't leave this moment thinking that we can once again turn away and do nothing. Can't do that this time. We just can't. The moment has come for our nation to deal with systemic graces to deal with the growing economic inequity that exists in our nation to deal with the denial of the promise of this nation made to so many. No, I've said from the outset of this election that were in the battle for the soul of this nation. We are in the battle for the soul of a nation. What we believe, maybe most importantly, who we want to be. It's all steak that's sure today than it's ever been leased in my lifetime. And it's this urgent. It's in the services we can find a path forward. Now the history of this nation teaches us that is some of our darkest moments of despair. We've made some of our greatest progress somewhere. Darkest moment. 13 14 15th Amendments follow the Civil War The greatest economic growth in world history grew out of the Great Depression. Civil Rights Act of 1964 and 65. Voting Rights Act of 65 came in the tracks of Bull Connor's vicious dogs. Prior phrase Reverend Barber. It's the morning we find hope. It's in the morning. We find hope when we more it's gonna take more than talk. Had talked before, read protest before we've got a now vowed to make this at least in their of action and reverse the systemic racism with a long overdue concrete changes. The action will not be completed in the 1st 100 days of my presidency. If I'm fortunate to be elected or even in my entire term, it's gonna take the work of a generation. But if this agenda will take time to complete, it should not wait for the 1st 100 days of my presidency to get started. A down payment, What is long overdue should come now should come immediately. I call in the Congress to act this month on measures that would be the first step in this direction, starting with real police reform. Congressman Jeffries has a bill to outlaw. Joe calls. Congress should put it on the president's desk in the next few days. The other measures to stop transferring weapons of war to police forces improve oversight and accountability to create a model use of force standard that also should be made long this month. No more excuses, no delays. If Mitch McConnell can bring in the United States Senate to confirm Trump's on qualified judicial nominees who will run roughshod over our constitution now it's time to pass legislation will give true meaning to our constitutional promise of equal protection under the law. Looking ahead, in the 1st 100 days of my presidency, I've committed to creating a national police oversight Commission. I've long believed we need riel community policing. We need each and every police Department of Country to understand a comprehensive review of the undertaking conference review of their hiring, their training de escalation. Some have already done it somehow are in the process of doing it. The federal government should give give the cities and states the tools and the resources they need to implement reforms. More police officers meet the higher standards of the procession. Most of them do it all. The more reason why bad cops should be dealt with severely and swiftly. We all need to take a hard look at the culture allows for the senseless tragedies to keep happening. We need to learn from the cities in the precincts that are getting it right. We know though we have in order to have true American justice, we need economic justice as well. Here, too, is there's much to be done. As a media step. Congress should act should act now to rectify racial inequities that allow Cove in 19 recovery funds to be diverted from where they live. I'll be setting forth my Jenna and economic justice and opportunity in the weeks and months ahead. But it begins with health care. Health care should be a right, not a privilege of the quickest route to universal coverage of this country's expand on Obama care. We could do it. We should do it. But this president, even now in the midst of a public health crisis with massive unemployment, well want to destroy it. He doesn't care how many millions Americans will be hurt because he's consumed with his blind. Any go when it comes to Barack Obama. President Obama. The presidency would draw his lawsuit to strike down Obamacare, and the Congress should prepare to pass the act. I proposed to expand Obama care to millions Mawr. So everyone's covered his last words. We've seen America's true heroes health care workers, docks, nurses, delivery truck drivers, grocery store workers. You know, we've come up with new phrase from essential workers. Essential worker way need to do more than praise them. We need to pay them. We need to pay them because we weren't clear before. It's clear now. This country wasn't built by Wall Street bankers and CEOs was built by the great American middle class, which is built by unions and are essential workers. You know, I know there's enormous fear and uncertainty and anger in the country. I understand. I know so many Americans are suffering, suffering, loss of a loved one. So for an economic hardship, wondering, can I feed my family tomorrow? What's gonna have suffering under the weight of a generation after generation after generation, I've heard inflicted on people of color black brown in native communities in particular. Like many of you, I know what it means. Degree. My losses are not the same as loss is felt by so many. But I know what it feels like when you think you can't go on. I know what it means to have that black hole in your chest where your grief is being sucked into it. Just a few days ago, mark the fifth anniversary of my son most passing. There are still moments when the pain is so great it feels no different than the day I sat in that bed as he passed away. But I also knew, but the best way to bear loss and pain to turn it into that anger and anguish in the purpose. And Americans know what our purposes is a nation. It has to be guided. Mr. Guided guided us from the very beginning. No, it's been reported the day that President John F. Kennedy was assassinated. Little Yolanda King came home from school in Atlanta and jumped in her daddy's arms, said, Oh, Daddy, she said, Now we're never going to get our freedom. Daddy was reassuring, Strong, brave. He said, No, don't worry, baby. It's gonna be OK. It's gonna be all right. Amid the violence and fear, Dr King persevered. He was driven by his dream of a nation where justice runs down like water and righteousness like a mighty stream. Then 19 68. Hate cut him down in Memphis two days before Dr Key was murdered. Hey gave a final Sunday sermon to Washington. No, he told us that though the arc of the moral universe is long said, it bends towards justice and we know we can bend it because we have. We have to believe that still, that's our purpose. It's been our purpose in the very beginning, to become a nation where all men and women are not only creating, but they're treated equally, not just credited, would treated equally to become a nation to find, in Dr King's words, not only by the absence of tension before the presence of justice, I'm not just a not attention but justice. Today in America, it's hard to keep faith the justices hated. I know that, you know pain is raw, the pain is really president of states must be part of the solution, not the problem. But this president today is part of the problem and accelerates. When you treated the words when the looting starts, the shooting starts. They weren't the words present. Their words of a racist Miami police chief in the sixties when he tweeted the protesters quote, would have been greeted with the most vicious dogs when people would have been really hurt. End of quote. They weren't the words of a president. They were the kind of words Bull Connor would have used, unleashing his dogs on innocent women and Children. You know, the American story is a story about action and reaction that's actually works. We can't be naive about it. I wish I could say that Hate began with Donald Trump will. And with him it didn't and it won't. American history is in a fairy tale with a guaranteed happy ending. The battle for the soul of this nation has been a constant push and pull for more than 240 years, a tug of war between the American ideal that we're all created equal in the harsh reality that racism has long torn us apart. The honest truth is that both elements are part of the American character, both elements at our best. The American ideal wins out, but it's never around. It's always a fight, and the battle is never fully one. But we can't ignore the truth that we're at our best when we open our hearts rather than clinch our fish. Donald Trump has turned this country in a battlefield driven by old resentments and fresh fears. He thinks division helps him. His narcissism has become more important than the nation's well being that he leads. I ask every American I mean this in the bottom, or ask every American look at where we are now and thinking new. Is this who we are? Is this what we want to be? Is this you want to pass on to our Children and our grandchildren? Fear, anger, finger pointing, rather the pursuit of happiness, incompetence and anxiety, self absorbed selfishness? Or do we want to be the America we know? We can be American. We know in our hearts we could be and should be. Look, I look at the presidency as a very big job and nobody we'll get it right every time. And I won't either. But I promise you this. I won't traffic in fear and division. I won't fan the flames of hate. I'll seek the heal, the racial wounds that have long plagued our country, not used them for political gain. I'll do my job and I will take responsibility. I won't blame others. I'll never forget. I will never forget. I promise you, this job is not about me. It's about you. It's about us work now gone to rebuild the nation, but build it better than it was. We're the only nation of the world that goes through a crisis and comes out better to build a better future That's what America does to build a better future. We build the future. It may in fact, be the most American thing to do. Build the future. We hunger for liberty the way Harriet Tubman and Frederick Douglass did. We thirst for the vote like Susan B. Anthony and Ella Baker and John Lewis. Did we strive to explore the stars, cure disease, make an in perfect union more perfect than has been? We may come up short, but at our best we try. My fellow Americans were facing a formidable enemies. They include not only the Corona virus and the table impact on the lives and livelihoods, but also the selfishness and fear that have loomed over our national life for the last three years. I choose those words advisedly, selfishness and fear. Defeating those enemies requires us to do our duty, and that duty includes remembering who we should be, who we should be. We should be the America of F. D. R. And Eisenhower of Rosa Parks and Martin Luther King Jr. Jonah Salt. Neil Armstrong. We should be the America that cherishes life, liberty and courage, and above all, we should be in America that chairs each other each and every one of us. You know, we're a nation in pain. We must let let our pain destroys. We're nation and raged. We can not our rage consume us. We're a nation. It's exhausted. But we will not allow our exhaustion to fetus as presidents. My commitment to all of you to lead on these issues and to listen because I truly believe in my heart of hearts we can't overcome. We stand together. Finally, is one America.

James Manni said. “These were not protesters. This was an intentional, coordinated attack on the city.""Police received intelligence several hours prior to the violence that people were coming from out of state armed with crow bars, flares and gasoline, Manni said.Providence Mayor Jorge Elorza on Tuesday morning said five of the people arrested were from out of state.Providence Public Safety Commissioner Steven M. Paré said Tuesday that none of the hurt officers was seriously injured.The trouble started at around midnight when a crowd of 300 to 500 people gathered in the street outside the Providence Place mall, police said. At about 2 a.m. police deployed tear gas to disperse the crowd, but fireworks and sirens continued to be heard in the city for hours, according to media reports.At one point several people broke into the mall, and Manni thinks they intended to set it on fire.Manni and Elorza say the damage could have been much worse had the police not been prepared.“Last night’s incidents were devastating for our community who has already experienced so much unrest and pain,"" Elorza said in a statement. “Violence is never the answer and we need collective action - one that is productive, not destruction of our small businesses, who have been impacted so much already and by putting others safety at risk.""The mall, which reopened for the first time Monday since being closed in mid-March because of the coronavirus pandemic, was closed Tuesday, according to its website.",0.0

THERE’S NOTHING Advertisement Death toll grows in national protests Share Shares Copy Link Copy Amid protests seeking justice for a black man killed after a white police officer pressed his knee into his neck, several people have lost their lives. They include a well-known and popular owner of a barbecue spot in Louisville, Kentucky and a federal officer working security at a courthouse in Oakland. Many of these deaths have gone unnoticed, overshadowed by the turmoil roiling American cities.One man was the beloved owner of a Louisville barbecue restaurant who made sure to provide free meals to officers. Another was a man known as ""Mr. Indianapolis,"" a former star football player. Yet another was a federal officer working security during a protest.They are among the people who have been killed as protests roiled American cities in the week since 46-year-old George Floyd died when a white officer jammed his knee into the back of the black man's neck. The deaths have at times been overshadowed by the shocking images of chaos engulfing cities across America, from heavy-handed riot police tactics to violence, vandalism and arson. Tens of thousands have marched peacefully in demonstrations against police brutality and racism.Many of the people killed were African Americans, compounding the tragedy for black families to lose more members of their community amid the unrest.Dozens more have been hurt in various altercations — vehicles plowing into crowds, police officers suffering head injuries and broken bones and protesters ending up in emergency rooms with a variety of injuries from the melees.The death toll and circumstances surrounding the killings are still being sorted out in many cities, but here is what we know about the cases so far:LOUISVILLEAs local police and the National Guard sought to disperse a crowd early Monday, they heard gunshots and returned fire, killing the owner of a barbecue restaurant, David McAtee. The mayor has since terminated the city's police chief after finding out that officers on the scene did not activate their body cameras. The state police and the U.S. attorney also are investigating.The 53-year-old McAtee was an African American man known for offering free meals to officers who stopped by.""We lost a wonderful citizen named David McAtee,"" Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer said. ""David was a friend to many, a well-known Barbecue man.""The protests in Louisville have centered not just on Floyd's killing but also the death of Breonna Taylor, a black woman killed in her home in Louisville in March. The 26-year-old EMT was shot eight times by narcotics detectives who knocked down her front door as they attempted to enforce a search warrant. No drugs were found in the home.___OAKLANDA federal law enforcement officer was providing security at the federal courthouse in Oakland during a protest when someone fired shots from a vehicle.Dave Patrick Underwood, 53, died and another officer was critically injured in the shooting. It was not immediately clear if the drive-by shooting was related to the protests, though the federal building's glass doors were smashed and the front entrance was sprayed with anti-police graffiti.Underwood, who was black, and the other officer were contracted security officers and employed by the Department of Homeland Security's Federal Protective Service; they were monitoring a nearby protest. No one has been arrested and a motive for the shooting has not yet been determined. Underwood was the brother of Angela Underwood Jacobs, recently a Republican candidate to fill a vacant U.S. congressional district north of Los Angeles. ___INDIANAPOLISTwo people were killed over the weekend amid unrest in Indianapolis, including 38-year-old Chris Beaty, a former offensive lineman for Indiana University.Beaty was known as ""Mr. Indianapolis"" and remained involved with the Hoosiers long after his graduation. He also was a prominent businessman in the city and ran multiple nightclubs.""I am at a loss for words. The news of the passing of Chris Beaty is just devastating,"" coach Tom Allen said in a statement. ""Since I returned home to coach at Indiana, Chris embraced me, encouraged me and supported me! His passion for life and Indiana Football energized me every time we were together.""The circumstances of his shooting weren't immediately clear but some media reports said it happened near an apartment where he lived. It also occurred the same night that an 18-year-old man also was fatally shot as protests broke out in the city.___MINNEAPOLISIn what is believed to be the first killing since the protests broke out, a 43-year-old black man was fatally shot outside a pawn shop as rioting broke out last week in Minneapolis and then spread nationally.The owner of the pawn shop, who is white, was arrested in the death of Calvin L. Horton Jr. Police say they are investigating the circumstances surrounding the killing, including whether it was related to protests in the neighborhood.The shop was described as having been significantly damaged during unrest. ___OMAHA, NEBRASKAA 22-year-old black man was killed after authorities said he tussled with the owner of two bars in downtown Omaha. Surveillance video of the strip of bars shows a group of people, including James Scurlock, approach bar owner Jake Gardner.Two people are seen on the video tackling Gardner, who ended up on his back and fired shots in the air. Seconds later, Scurlock is seen tackling Gardner, who then fires the gun over his shoulder, striking Scurlock.Authorities have declined to press charges, calling the shooting self-defense.___DETROITA 21-year-old man was killed in downtown Detroit after someone fired shots into a vehicle during a protest. According to a police report, the man was sitting in the driver's seat of a car in a parking lot with two others when someone fired shots into the vehicle and then fled on foot.___CHICAGO SUBURBTwo people were killed during unrest Monday in the Chicago suburb of Cicero, according to a town official.

You say you're against police brutality; will you do something humble and kneel with us?' and I said, 'Absolutely,' and I did and several of my officers joined me,"" Isaac said.Isaac spoke during a briefing Monday on the protests over the weekend, saying he and none of his staff believe what took place in Minneapolis was right and know law enforcement is more professional than that.""We have to move past this and those that have not made those necessary changes, they need to do that as well. I'm very proud of the work our men and women are doing,"" Isaac said. Protests in Cincinnati were largely peaceful Monday, scattered across the city's urban core and were relatively quiet, at least when compared to days prior.The protests are in honor of George Floyd. Floyd, a black man, was killed after a white officer pressed a knee into his neck while taking him into custody in Minnesota.A number of groups have been holding peaceful rallies to get the true message of their moment out, highlighting what they say are racial injustices and police brutality across the country. Organizers are asking participants to respect social distancing guidelines, wear masks and keep in groups no larger than 10 people.The protests have been followed by three nights of unrest in the city, with vandalism and looting during the first two nights.Isaac said he understands people are angry and he shares that anger and wants to talk about it.""It's never too late to talk. I understand that people are angry if we're not going to talk what's going to happen then, is this going to go on indefinitely. Yeah we need to talk; we need to talk about how to make things better; we need to talk about more reform; we need to listen to what the community is saying, particularly our young people; that's most important to me,"" Isaac said.Ohio State Sen. Cecil Thomas said his hope is that the protests continue peacefully in order for the true message to be heard.""The peaceful protesters. They done what they wanted to do.

If he did, he’d find the First Amendment. It protects the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.” Trump senior advisor Kellyanne Conway denied that the president directed authorities’ actions to move back the protesters and bristled at suggestions the church visit was merely a photo op. She countered that Biden and other critics had no basis to second-guess what was in the president’s heart and his intentions. Still, Biden’s address marked a new phase of a presidential campaign that had been effectively frozen for more than two months by the spread of the coronavirus. The former vice president is now emerging from his Delaware home to confront Trump and using in-person appearances to offer direct competition with the president, rather than relying on virtual events that often failed to garner a lot of attention. It was the third consecutive day that Biden made a public appearance and the first time he’s been out of the state since March. His remarks were carried live on the three major cable news networks. Biden spoke as upheaval in the wake of George Floyd’s death has spread around the country. While Biden spoke, the National Guard maintained a visible presence to defend public buildings as Philadelphia continues to face sustained violent protests. Several buildings adjacent to City Hall, including banks, convenience stores and hotels, were boarded up. He spoke of the “tug of war between the American ideal that we are all created equal and the harsh reality that racism has long torn us apart.” “The honest truth is both elements are part of the American character,” he said. Since the early days of his candidacy, Biden has framed the election as a “battle for the soul of the nation.” He went into greater detail on Tuesday about what that meant and the questions voters should ask themselves. “I ask every American to look at where we are now and think anew: Is this who we are?” he said. “Is this who we want to be? Is this what we pass on to our kids’ and grandkids’ lives? Fear and finger-pointing rather than hope and the pursuit of happiness? Incompetence and anxiety? Self-absorption and selfishness?” The tone was part of Biden’s effort to cast himself as a “consoler in chief” in stark contrast to Trump’s blunt, confrontational style. While he noted that his anguish over the death of his son Beau five years ago from cancer isn’t the same as the sadness felt by those protesting police brutality, he said he understood the hopelessness that can come with grief. “Like many of you, I know what it’s like to grieve,” Biden said. “I know what it feels like when you’re thinking you can’t go on.” He said “bad cops should be dealt with severely and swiftly” and offered examples of how he might ease racial tensions and govern. The former vice president called on Congress to act now on legislation that would place a federal ban on police using chokeholds. Biden also promised that, if elected, he would increase access to health care and improve the pay of first-responders and other workers who have stayed on jobs deemed essential during the pandemic. But Biden’s speech was perhaps most notable for its ferocity, even though his criticism of Trump is common. He accused the president of being more worried about himself than the nation at a time when it “is crying out for leadership.” “This president today is part of the problem and accelerates it,” Biden said, adding that Trump is “consumed with his blinding ego.” Biden offered a stark departure from Trump, who tweeted Tuesday that Washington “had no problems last night” and cited “many arrests,” as well as “overwhelming force” and “Domination,” for which he thanked himself. Trump has embraced the language of confrontation and war, seeking to be a “president of law and order,” and betting that voters will want a more forceful approach at a time of national tumult and racial unrest. Katrina Pierson, a senior adviser to the president’s re-election campaign, said Biden’s speech “obviously made the crass political calculation that unrest in America is a benefit to his candidacy.” “President Trump is restoring the nation to order and is clearly the leader we need to return the country to peace and prosperity,” Pierson said in a statement. Despite his more confrontational approach, Biden was direct about the limits of his ability to singularly reconcile the nation’s differences. He was careful to note that his administration won’t be able to fix everything, especially not all at once. “I know that the presidency, that’s a very big job,” he said. “Nobody will get it right every time, and I won’t either.” But he vowed not to “traffic in fear and division.” “I won’t fan the flames of hate,” Biden said. “I’ll seek to heal the racial wounds that have long plagued our country, not use them for political gain.” Send questions/comments to the editors. « Previous Next » filed under:",0.0
1623396027,2020-06-02 11:41:13,Police arrest 23 during overnight clashes with demonstrators,https://www.pressherald.com/2020/06/02/police-arrest-23-during-overnight-clashes-with-demonstrators/,en,False,,366984,pressherald.com,http://pressherald.com/,"Portland police arrested 23 people during an anti-racism demonstration that brought up to 1,000 people into city streets Monday evening and lasted into the early-morning hours. The protesters amassed outside the Portland police station in a confrontation that moved around the downtown area and lasted until nearly 2 a.m., police said. Officers from 15 other police departments joined Portland police and stood shoulder-to-shoulder carrying wooden batons and plastic riot shields. Everyone arrested during the demonstration posted bail by Tuesday morning, said police spokesman Lt. Robert Martin. All but one person was charged with failure to disperse, a misdemeanor. One man, the driver of a tractor-trailer truck that entered the protest area near the intersection of Middle and Franklin streets, was charged with reckless conduct with dangerous weapon, a class-C felony. Throughout the night, there was a push and pull between organizers who sought to keep the demonstrations peaceful, and people who threw water bottles and other objects at police, destroyed property and defaced businesses. At one point, some police knelt with protesters, drawing cheers from the crowd. Others talked with protesters from the police line, but most officers remained silent or did not react or engage. Chief Frank Clark released a statement Tuesday afternoon in which he expressed disgust at the killing of George Floyd, the 46-year-old Minneapolis man who died in police custody when an officer pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck for nearly nine minutes, until he lost consciousness and stopped breathing. But Clark said a smaller segment of demonstrators was determined to cause trouble, leading to the harsher response by officers. “Our goal remains providing a safe environment for those wishing to peacefully express their views and First Amendment rights,” Clark said in the statement. “We are fortunate that no one was seriously injured and that most of the property damage was minimal. Unfortunately a committed smaller segment of this group ended up making this event anything other than a peaceful and lawful protest. They took the opportunity to commit acts of violence, damage public and private property and place my officers and the public at risk. We will not stand for such criminal behavior.” Attempts to reach the demonstration’s organizer, David Thete, were unsuccessful Monday evening. A number for Thete was no longer accepting incoming calls, and a message sent to him on social media was not returned. Police say demonstrators on Monday night threw rocks, bottles, bricks and urine at police, and several trash cans were set on fire in the Old Port. Around 9 p.m. as night fell, demonstrators at one point encircled two police vehicles near the station and began striking them, Martin said. Demonstrators threatened police with death, police said in the release. Four businesses were burglarized and five had windows broken or saw other acts of criminal mischief; officers also cited two dozen instances of graffiti in the Old Port area. As the night progressed, cars revved their engines and sped down empty streets. Some passing motorists honked in support of the demonstration, while others antagonized them – one man driving a large black pickup truck reached out from his open window, made the shape of a gun with his fingers and mimicked shooting a group of young black men standing on a corner, two blocks from the epicenter of the confrontation, before driving off. Police said one officer was struck in the face with a water bottle but did not need medical attention, and a small number of demonstrators who were sprayed by officers with pepper spray required assistance from paramedics. The demonstration began peacefully, with hundreds staging a die-in on Middle Street in front of the police station. Protesters re-established a makeshift memorial on the police department steps dedicated to those who have been killed by police across the nation. “There’s no bright line. We don’t say, ’10 o’clock we open the road back up,’ ” Martin said. “If it stayed peaceful for several more hours, I don’t think anything would have happened. There were trash cans set on fire and they were encircling police cars and trying to break police car windows.” Martin estimated there were more than 100 officers on the scene, including many called from neighboring departments, the Cumberland County Sheriff’s Office, and the Maine State Police. The Maine Department of Transportation shut down Exit 7, which leads to Franklin Street and the epicenter of the confrontation, in both directions. Cumberland County District Attorney Jonathan Sahrbeck said he will be reviewing police reports and other information before making a decision on how to proceed with any charges. “We are still going to be looking at the cases and making sure that we get all the information we can before we make any charging decisions at the DA’s office,” Sahrbeck said Tuesday. “So we don’t know exactly how we’re going to proceed at this time.” In 2016, a group of 17 Black Lives Matter protesters were arrested after a march in Portland. But a plea deal between the protesters and then-District Attorney Stephanie Anderson fell apart because the parties could not agree on the terms of a restorative justice meeting. A judge later denied Anderson’s attempt to restore the criminal charges, and the prosecutor did not pursue a meeting further. Sahrbeck said he was not yet sure whether restorative justice would be the right approach in these cases. “Obviously that didn’t work out as the parties initially thought it would,” Sahrbeck said. “I’m never going to rule out anything on day one. Restorative justice is something we’re trying to use a lot more in my office right now.” The clash with Portland police was one among hundreds of rallies across the country involving millions of Americans on Monday night. Not since the civil rights movement of the 1960s has the United States seen such widespread urban uprisings that organizers say are a reaction to decades of unrelenting, systemic racism and police forces that operates with impunity, even when officers kill and maim the citizens they’re sworn to protect. The arrest tally eclipses the 18 demonstrators who were charged in 2016, after a group protesting the killing of two black men in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and in a suburb of St. Paul, Minnesota, blocked traffic along Commercial Street in the Old Port on a busy Friday night. Those charges were eventually dropped after a disputed restorative justice meeting fell apart before it could begin. This story will be updated.

In a call with governors, President Trump and Attorney General William Barr also encouraged more aggressive action against those who cause violence during protests across the country following the killing of George Floyd, a handcuffed black man who died after a white Minneapolis policeman pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes even after Floyd stopped moving and pleading for air. The demonstrations have turned violent in several cities, with fires ignited in Lafayette Park across from the White House. The comments from Trump, Barr and other federal officials appeared aimed at avoiding similar scenes on Monday night, when protesters are expected to gather again. But there are also questions about whether using more aggressive law enforcement measures against demonstrators protesting police brutality would only increase tensions. Barr told the state leaders that law enforcement officials must “have adequate force” and “go after troublemakers.” “Law enforcement response is not going to work unless we dominate the streets,” Barr said. The president urged governors to deploy the National Guard, which he credited with helping calm the situation Sunday night in Minneapolis and demanded that similarly tough measures be taken in cities that also experienced a spasm of violence, including New York, Philadelphia and Los Angeles. Between the protests and the response to the coronavirus pandemic, the National Guard has been deployed at its highest level in recent history, surpassing the number of troops sent to the Gulf Coast during Hurricane Katrina in 2005. More than 66,700 soldiers and airman have been activated — 45,000 to assist with the pandemic and more than 17,000 to help with the protests. Other law enforcement resources are also being mobilized. The Justice Department deployed the U.S. Marshals Service and agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration to supplement National Guard troops in Washington on Sunday. By midnight, Barr had ordered the FBI to deploy its Hostage Rescue Team, an elite tactical unit, to the streets of the nation’s capital, a senior Justice Department official said. Barr has also directed the federal Bureau of Prisons to send teams of prison riot officers to patrol the streets in Miami and Washington, D.C., said the official, who could not discuss the matter publicly and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity. The U.S. Park Police and Secret Service have had dozens of officers out in riot gear in Washington for the last few nights, in addition to the Metropolitan Police Department. U.S. Customs and Border Protection was also sending officers, agents and aircraft around the country to assist other law enforcement agencies “confronting the lawless actions of rioters,” the agency said. The officers were being deployed in several states, though the official declined to provide specific details, citing security concerns. Several major cities have enacted curfews, and District of Columbia Mayor Muriel Bowser set a 7 p.m. curfew for Monday and Tuesday. Violent demonstrators ignored the 11 p.m. curfew the night before as they set buildings and trash cans on fire and broke into stores to steal items from the shelves. Most of the protesters have been peaceful and tried to discourage violence. Trump, Barr and others have tried to blame some of the civil unrest on left-wing extremist groups, including antifa, and other “anarchists.” Short for anti-fascists, antifa is an umbrella term for far-left-leaning militant groups that resist neo-Nazis and white supremacists at demonstrations. The FBI is using its network of regional joint terrorism task forces to “identify criminal organizers,” and federal prosecutors across the country have been instructed to share information and utilize federal riot, arson or terror statutes against any “violent radical agitators” who attempt to hijack protests to cause destruction. The Justice Department has vowed to treat the “violence instigated and carried out by antifa & other similar groups” as domestic terrorism. Although there isn’t a specific federal domestic terrorism statute, prosecutors could charge other offenses and seek enhanced sentencing. The FBI has already started questioning rioters who were arrested in several cities to determine whether they committed any federal crimes, the senior Justice Department official said. It is a federal crime to cross state lines to participate in violent riots. Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy called in the entire D.C. National Guard late Sunday, adding 1,200 soldiers to join about 500 forces that had already deployed in Washington, according to two Defense Department officials. The soldiers will also be armed, the officials said, citing the potential threat from the protesters. Additional National Guard troops from nearby states were also being called in to help assist in Washington, officials said. Units from the 82nd Airborne Division’s Immediate Response Force, normally stationed at Fort Bragg in North Carolina, are also expected to deploy to Washington on Tuesday, according to three Defense Department officials. The officials all spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. Send questions/comments to the editors.",0.0

1623407201,2020-06-01 20:13:55,"Calling for justice, Black Lives Matter rally draws crowd in Lewiston and Auburn",https://www.centralmaine.com/2020/06/01/calling-for-justice-black-lives-matter-rally-draws-crowd-in-twin-cities/,en,False,,25755,Central Maine News,https://www.centralmaine.com/,"LEWISTON — As people started arriving Monday afternoon at Kennedy Park for a Black Lives Matter protest, 13-year-old Musdaf Said stood beside a couple of friends watching. The Lewiston Middle School student said he supported the cause that drew more than 350 people to the impromptu march to demand justice in the wake of the May 25 killing of George Floyd by police in Minnesota. “We’re getting killed for walking in the streets,” Said said. “These cops keep shooting us for dead.” In the hope of forging a better future, a racially mixed and mostly young crowd marched more than five miles through Lewiston and Auburn on Monday afternoon holding signs and chanting for justice. “For too long, black lives have been taken too early,” said Lewiston City Council member Safiya Khalid. It has to stop, she told the crowd from the steps of the police station. “No more. No more violence. No more senseless killings,” Khalid told the cheering crowd. “It has gone on for way too long.” Some of the signs held by marchers contained lists of the familiar names of black men and women who died at the hands of the police or white vigilantes. Cliff Odle, who teaches theater at Bates College, said he came because his 13-year-old daughter heard about the rally and he thought they should attend. Odle called the event “a necessary action” to give a voice to the demand for justice that is ringing throughout the country. Lewiston, he said, is not an island, but part of a whole that has seen too many die like Floyd, pinned beneath a police officer’s knee as he begged, fruitlessly, for breath. The officer has been charged with third-degree murder as authorities in Minnesota continue to investigate. Three other officers at the scene of Floyd’s death were fired. The killing has set off a surge of protests across the country that have included peaceful demonstrations by millions, as well as clashes between police and more militant protesters in many large cities and some smaller communities. Lewiston Mayor Mark Cayer, who marched along with the crowd, said he knows there is frustration and anger that he can see plainly. But, he said, he hasn’t “lived it” like so many non-white Americans, so he came to hear them. It is important, Cayer said, for the city “to provide a safe place” for the community speak. The police were eager to offer protection for the marchers, blocking off intersections and shutting down traffic as at least 350 people hoofed around Lewiston and Auburn chanting “No Justice/No Peace” and other slogans. Perhaps the most common one was a call and response, “Say his name/George Floyd” over and over, an effort to burrow his name and his death into the consciousness of the nation. The marchers set out from Kennedy Park about 3:15 p.m., headed down Chestnut Street to Lincoln Street before crossing the bridge into Auburn. Setting a brisk pace, they walked on Court Street until they reached Goff Street, proceeding to Dennison Street to Turner Street and then back across the bridge, down Lisbon Street and back to the park. Four miles in little more than an hour wasn’t quite enough. The marchers headed up Birch Street to Bartlett Street and then turned back to the park along Walnut Street. There were no serious problems for police along the route. At one point, a black man stood in front of a state police car for a minute, blocking its way, until he gave way to the pleading of other marchers to let the officer do his job. At the end of the march, a woman yelling that “All Lives Matter” drew a small crowd ready to argue, but they dispersed after a number of people urged them not to let her effort to antagonize them succeed. Odle said he was encouraged to see so many young people pushing for a more just world. His generation, he said, “dropped the ball,” but he’s determined to do what he can to create a better future for his children. As a black man, Odle said, he knows what it’s like to be pulled over by police while he’s driving or eyed suspiciously for matching some vague description of a possible criminal. It’s not how the country should be, he said. By the time the marchers reached the police station beside the park about 4:45 p.m., Khalid said she had long since lost her voice. But when offered a megaphone, she managed to get a few words out, even if most couldn’t hear them especially well. Khalid, the first elected city councilor from the Somali community in Lewiston, told them she is a black woman with black brothers. She said the country needs reform. Police need reform, Khalid added. To get the policy changes that will do the job, she said, is going to take work. “You are the change we want to see in this country,” Khalid told the crowd. “We need to get our ballots and votes,” Khalid said, and get involved in elections for local, state and national offices to make sure the best candidates win. “We have to do more,” she said. Then she asked the crowd, “What are you going to do?” The answer came loud and clear: “Vote! Vote! Vote!” Send questions/comments to the editors. « Previous Next » filed under:",0.0

The peaceful march stopped at the Sagadahoc County Courthouse, the Bath Police Department and ended in front of City Hall. Many protests, vigils and marches have taken place across the country in reaction to the death of George Floyd, a black man killed a week ago as a Minneapolis police officer held Floyd down with a knee to the back of Floyd’s neck. In Bath, protesters chanted “I can’t breathe,” in reference to Floyd and Eric Garner, a black man in New York who died while being restrained by a police officer. Both men were recorded saying “I can’t breathe” in the moments before their death, Devin Moore, 28, of Bath, said the march was an opportunity to unify the city where he’s lived most of his life. “Everybody’s affected by these things,” he said. While Black Lives Matter is the narrative, “It’s not just black people. It’s deeper than that.” Those who may not understand what it’s like to be black or experience racism also come to a Black Lives Matter march to become educated, Moore said. “I learn from everyone,” he said. “I learn not to judge.” Reporter Darcie Moore is not related to Devin Moore.

Someone from the crowd said they need to work together to make change. “We need to use our privilege to dismantle racism,” Stephanie Harman of Farmington said following the march.

President Trump had announced he would soon be addressing the nation from the White House Rose Garden, as a 7 p.m. curfew in the city loomed and a mass of law enforcement, including U.S. Secret Service agents, Park Police and National Guardsmen, stood sentry, many dressed in riot gear. Moments before 6:30 p.m., just when Trump said he would begin his address, the officers suddenly marched forward, directly confronting the protesters as many held up their hands, saying, “Don’t shoot.” Soon, law enforcement officers were aggressively forcing the protesters back, firing tear gas and deploying flash bangs into the crowd to disperse them from the park for seemingly no reason. It was a jarring scene as police in the nation’s capital forcefully cleared young men and women gathered legally in a public park on a sunny evening, all of it on live television. With smoke still wafting and isolated tussles continuing in the crowd, Trump emerged in the Rose Garden for a dramatic split-screen of his own creation. “I am your president of law and order and an ally of all peaceful protesters,” he declared, before demanding that governors across the nation deploy the National Guard “in sufficient numbers that we dominate the streets.” And he warned that, if they refused, he would deploy the United States military “and quickly solve the problem for them.” As an additional show of force, Trump announced he was deploying even more of the military to Washington, D.C., giving it the feel of an armed, locked-down city after days of violent clashes, arson and looting. “As we speak I am dispatching thousands and thousands of heavily armed soldiers,” he said, as explosions rang out in the background. “We are putting everybody on warning.” Then, before departing, Trump announced he wasn’t done for the evening, and would be “going to pay my respects to a very very special place.” Moments later, the White House press pool was quickly summoned for a surprise movement. And soon after, Trump strolled out of the White House gates — something he had never done — and walked across the park that had just been cleared to accommodate his movements. Trump walked slowly, followed by an entourage of his most senior aides, security and reporters. The faint residue of pepper spray hung in the air, stinging eyes and prompting coughing. Sections of the park and surrounding sidewalks were strewn with garbage, including plastic water bottles and other debris. Some sections had been scrawled with graffiti. Trump crossed H Street and walked toward St. John’s Church, the landmark pale yellow building where every president, including Trump, has prayed. It had been damaged Sunday night in a protest fire. Trump, standing alone in front of cameras, then raised a black-covered Bible for reporters to see. “We have a great country,” Trump said. “Greatest country in the world.” He didn’t talk about Floyd, the church or the damage it had suffered, or the peaceful protesters police had cleared. He said nothing about the coronavirus pandemic, the parallel crisis that has continued to ravage the nation as Trump campaigns for a second presidential term. And then he invited his attorney general, national security adviser, chief of staff, press secretary and defense secretary — all white — to join him for another round of photos before he walked back across the park to the White House. At one point, he stopped and pumped his fist in the air at National Guard members in the distance. “We’re going to keep it nice and safe,” he said. Rabbi Jack Moline, the president of Interfaith Alliance, slammed the fact that peaceful protesters near the White House were gassed and shot with rubber bullets so Trump could hold his photo op. “Seeing President Trump stand in front of St. John’s Episcopal Church while holding a Bible in response to calls for racial justice — right after using military force to clear peaceful protesters out of the area — is one of the most flagrant misuses of religion I have ever seen,” Moline said in a statement. This only underscores the president’s complete lack of compassion for Black Americans and the lethal consequences of racism.” And the Right Rev. Mariann Budde, bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Washington, to which St. John’s belongs, said she was “outraged” by the moment and noted that Trump didn’t pray during his visit. “He took the symbols sacred to our tradition and stood in front of a house of prayer in full expectation that would be a celebratory moment,” Budde told The Associated Press. “There was nothing I could do but speak out against that.” Related Headlines Use of force criticized in protests about police brutality Send questions/comments to the editors. « Previous Next »",0.0
1623407158,2020-06-02 07:34:43,Biden vows to take on systemic racism,https://www.centralmaine.com/2020/06/02/biden-vows-to-take-on-systemic-racism/,en,False,,25755,Central Maine News,https://www.centralmaine.com/,"WILMINGTON, Del. — Joe Biden vowed to address institutional racism in his first 100 days in office as he sought to elevate his voice Monday in the exploding national debate over racism and police brutality. The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee offered emotional support and promised bold action during an in-person discussion with black leaders in Delaware and a subsequent virtual meeting with big-city mayors who are grappling with racial tensions and frustrated by a lack of federal support. “Hate just hides. It doesn’t go away, and when you have somebody in power who breathes oxygen into the hate under the rocks, it comes out from under the rocks,” Biden told more than a dozen African American leaders gathered at a church in downtown Wilmington, his face mask lowered around his chin as he spoke. Without offering specifics, he promised to “deal with institutional racism” and set up a police oversight body in his first 100 days in office, if elected. The former vice president also said he’d be releasing an economic plan focused on education, housing and “access to capital” and investments, especially for minority Americans, later this month. “I really do believe that the blinders have been taken off. I think this tidal wave is moving,” Biden told the mayors of Atlanta, Chicago, Los Angeles and St. Paul, Minnesota. “I realize we’ve got to do something big, we can do it, and everyone will benefit from it.” Largely sheltering in place amid the coronavirus, Biden has struggled in recent weeks to be heard from his makeshift home TV studio over the noise of dueling national crises. But after another night of violent protests, he ventured out into public for the second time in two days and just the third time since the pandemic arrived in mid-March. His hopeful and collaborative approach marked a sharp contrast to that of President Donald Trump, who has made little effort to unify the country. The Republican president slammed governors as “weak” during a video teleconference on Monday and demanded tougher crackdowns on protesters. Trump also lashed out at Biden on Twitter, writing that “Sleepy Joe Biden’s people are so Radical Left that they are working to get the Anarchists out of jail, and probably more.” Biden’s softer style may foreshadow how he presents himself in the five months before the presidential election, emphasizing calm and competence as a contrast to a mercurial president. It is an approach that carries the risk of being drowned out by Trump’s much louder voice. “He’s not in office, and he certainly does not have the megaphone like the person currently occupying the White House does, but I do think our people are looking for someone who can make them feel better during these extremely tough times,” said Rep. Val Demings of Florida, whom Biden is considering as a running mate. “America just needs to be reassured that there’s someone who’s understanding, someone who’s willing to say, ‘Yes, we do have some issues,’ and someone who’s willing to address it.” Biden delivered a well-received address on Friday calling on white people to shoulder the responsibility of ending America’s systemic racism. But he was largely out of sight over the weekend, which marked the fifth anniversary of the death of his son Beau Biden from brain cancer. Biden and his wife, Jill, marked Memorial Day by laying a wreath at a veterans’ memorial near his Wilmington home last week, and the former vice president’s campaign posted pictures of him visiting a protest site in the city on Sunday afternoon. Earlier, he wrote a post on Medium expressing empathy for those despairing about the police killing of George Floyd. In the early moments of Monday’s gathering at the Bethel AME church in Wilmington, Biden listened quietly and took notes. All the attendees, including Biden, wore face masks but lowered them as they spoke. “The vice president came to hear from us. This is a homeboy,” pastor Sylvester Beaman said before everyone bowed their heads in prayer. Biden’s standing with the black community weighs heavily as he works to deny Trump a second term. African Americans rescued Biden’s flailing primary campaign, but it’s unclear if they will turn out for him in large numbers in November. “I want to make something clear. I don’t expect anything from the black community,” Biden said Monday, insisting he has never taken its support for granted. The former vice president has been doing cleanup since telling a prominent black radio host a week and a half ago that African Americans who back Trump “ain’t black.” Yet the mayors who spoke with Biden, three of whom are black, were clearly frustrated and angry with Trump, who has offered military support to address violent protests while denying them federal support to address the coronavirus fallout and repeatedly attacking them on social media. “To see the president of the United States say that he’s going to send the military into our communities but hadn’t mentioned sending a single dime of support into our communities, speaks to where we are in America,” said Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms. Much of Biden’s campaign strategy centers on trying to draw a contrast with Trump on temperament and values. He has called the White House contest a battle for the soul of the nation and has been particularly forceful in condemning Trump’s handling of moments of racial tension. In an election that is likely to be a referendum on the sitting president, some Biden aides say privately that the best plan may be to let Trump do himself in. Yet there is also a recognition that Biden needs to do more than simply wait for voters who may be turned off by Trump to turn toward him. Some Democrats who have criticized Biden for not being more visible during the onset of the coronavirus said he is making the right moves now. “I’m sure they have some reluctance, understandably, right now to politicize it. That’s not who he is,” said Democratic strategist James Carville. “There might be a time for eloquence, but I think that simplicity is eloquence right now.” Send questions/comments to the editors. « Previous Next »",0.0
1623407135,2020-06-02 11:23:07,"Biden: Trump ‘consumed’ by ego, not leading during national crisis",https://www.centralmaine.com/2020/06/02/biden-trump-consumed-by-ego-not-leading-during-national-crisis/,en,False,,25755,Central Maine News,https://www.centralmaine.com/,"PHILADELPHIA — Joe Biden mounted one of his most aggressive attacks against President Trump on Tuesday, deriding the commander in chief’s disregard of core constitutional values and blistering him for being “more interested in power than in principle.” “He thinks division helps him,” the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee said in a speech at Philadelphia’s City Hall. “This narcissism has become more important than the nation’s well-being.” Biden seized on police driving back peaceful protesters near the White House on Monday so Trump could briefly pose with a Bible in front of nearby St. John’s Church. “If he opened it instead of brandishing it, he could have learned something,” Biden said as he chided authorities for using “tear gas and flash grenades in order to stage a photo op.” Biden said Trump “might also want to open the U.S. Constitution. If he did, he’d find the First Amendment. It protects the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.” Trump senior advisor Kellyanne Conway denied that the president directed authorities’ actions to move back the protesters and bristled at suggestions the church visit was merely a photo op. She countered that Biden and other critics had no basis to second-guess what was in the president’s heart and his intentions. Still, Biden’s address marked a new phase of a presidential campaign that had been effectively frozen for more than two months by the spread of the coronavirus. The former vice president is now emerging from his Delaware home to confront Trump and using in-person appearances to offer direct competition with the president, rather than relying on virtual events that often failed to garner a lot of attention. It was the third consecutive day that Biden made a public appearance and the first time he’s been out of the state since March. His remarks were carried live on the three major cable news networks. Biden spoke as upheaval in the wake of George Floyd’s death has spread around the country. While Biden spoke, the National Guard maintained a visible presence to defend public buildings as Philadelphia continues to face sustained violent protests. Several buildings adjacent to City Hall, including banks, convenience stores and hotels, were boarded up. He spoke of the “tug of war between the American ideal that we are all created equal and the harsh reality that racism has long torn us apart.” “The honest truth is both elements are part of the American character,” he said. Since the early days of his candidacy, Biden has framed the election as a “battle for the soul of the nation.” He went into greater detail on Tuesday about what that meant and the questions voters should ask themselves. “I ask every American to look at where we are now and think anew: Is this who we are?” he said. “Is this who we want to be? Is this what we pass on to our kids’ and grandkids’ lives? Fear and finger-pointing rather than hope and the pursuit of happiness? Incompetence and anxiety? Self-absorption and selfishness?” The tone was part of Biden’s effort to cast himself as a “consoler in chief” in stark contrast to Trump’s blunt, confrontational style. While he noted that his anguish over the death of his son Beau five years ago from cancer isn’t the same as the sadness felt by those protesting police brutality, he said he understood the hopelessness that can come with grief. “Like many of you, I know what it’s like to grieve,” Biden said. “I know what it feels like when you’re thinking you can’t go on.” He said “bad cops should be dealt with severely and swiftly” and offered examples of how he might ease racial tensions and govern. The former vice president called on Congress to act now on legislation that would place a federal ban on police using chokeholds. Biden also promised that, if elected, he would increase access to health care and improve the pay of first-responders and other workers who have stayed on jobs deemed essential during the pandemic. But Biden’s speech was perhaps most notable for its ferocity, even though his criticism of Trump is common. He accused the president of being more worried about himself than the nation at a time when it “is crying out for leadership.” “This president today is part of the problem and accelerates it,” Biden said, adding that Trump is “consumed with his blinding ego.” Biden offered a stark departure from Trump, who tweeted Tuesday that Washington “had no problems last night” and cited “many arrests,” as well as “overwhelming force” and “Domination,” for which he thanked himself. Trump has embraced the language of confrontation and war, seeking to be a “president of law and order,” and betting that voters will want a more forceful approach at a time of national tumult and racial unrest. Katrina Pierson, a senior adviser to the president’s re-election campaign, said Biden’s speech “obviously made the crass political calculation that unrest in America is a benefit to his candidacy.” “President Trump is restoring the nation to order and is clearly the leader we need to return the country to peace and prosperity,” Pierson said in a statement. Despite his more confrontational approach, Biden was direct about the limits of his ability to singularly reconcile the nation’s differences. He was careful to note that his administration won’t be able to fix everything, especially not all at once. “I know that the presidency, that’s a very big job,” he said. “Nobody will get it right every time, and I won’t either.” But he vowed not to “traffic in fear and division.” “I won’t fan the flames of hate,” Biden said. “I’ll seek to heal the racial wounds that have long plagued our country, not use them for political gain.” Send questions/comments to the editors. « Previous Next » filed under:",0.0
1623407126,2020-06-02 11:41:13,Police arrest 23 during overnight clashes with demonstrators,https://www.centralmaine.com/2020/06/02/police-arrest-23-during-overnight-clashes-with-demonstrators/,en,False,,25755,Central Maine News,https://www.centralmaine.com/,"Portland police arrested 23 people during an anti-racism demonstration that brought up to 1,000 people into city streets Monday evening and lasted into the early-morning hours. The protesters amassed outside the Portland police station in a confrontation that moved around the downtown area and lasted until nearly 2 a.m., police said. Officers from 15 other police departments joined Portland police and stood shoulder-to-shoulder carrying wooden batons and plastic riot shields. Everyone arrested during the demonstration posted bail by Tuesday morning, said police spokesman Lt. Robert Martin. All but one person was charged with failure to disperse, a misdemeanor. One man, the driver of a tractor-trailer truck that entered the protest area near the intersection of Middle and Franklin streets, was charged with reckless conduct with dangerous weapon, a class-C felony. Throughout the night, there was a push and pull between organizers who sought to keep the demonstrations peaceful, and people who threw water bottles and other objects at police, destroyed property and defaced businesses. At one point, some police knelt with protesters, drawing cheers from the crowd. Others talked with protesters from the police line, but most officers remained silent or did not react or engage. Chief Frank Clark released a statement Tuesday afternoon in which he expressed disgust at the killing of George Floyd, the 46-year-old Minneapolis man who died in police custody when an officer pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck for nearly nine minutes, until he lost consciousness and stopped breathing. But Clark said a smaller segment of demonstrators was determined to cause trouble, leading to the harsher response by officers. “Our goal remains providing a safe environment for those wishing to peacefully express their views and First Amendment rights,” Clark said in the statement. “We are fortunate that no one was seriously injured and that most of the property damage was minimal. Unfortunately a committed smaller segment of this group ended up making this event anything other than a peaceful and lawful protest. They took the opportunity to commit acts of violence, damage public and private property and place my officers and the public at risk. We will not stand for such criminal behavior.” Attempts to reach the demonstration’s organizer, David Thete, were unsuccessful Monday evening. A number for Thete was no longer accepting incoming calls, and a message sent to him on social media was not returned. Police say demonstrators on Monday night threw rocks, bottles, bricks and urine at police, and several trash cans were set on fire in the Old Port. Around 9 p.m. as night fell, demonstrators at one point encircled two police vehicles near the station and began striking them, Martin said. Demonstrators threatened police with death, police said in the release. Four businesses were burglarized and five had windows broken or saw other acts of criminal mischief; officers also cited two dozen instances of graffiti in the Old Port area. As the night progressed, cars revved their engines and sped down empty streets. Some passing motorists honked in support of the demonstration, while others antagonized them – one man driving a large black pickup truck reached out from his open window, made the shape of a gun with his fingers and mimicked shooting a group of young black men standing on a corner, two blocks from the epicenter of the confrontation, before driving off. Police said one officer was struck in the face with a water bottle but did not need medical attention, and a small number of demonstrators who were sprayed by officers with pepper spray required assistance from paramedics. The demonstration began peacefully, with hundreds staging a die-in on Middle Street in front of the police station. Protesters re-established a makeshift memorial on the police department steps dedicated to those who have been killed by police across the nation. “There’s no bright line. We don’t say, ’10 o’clock we open the road back up,’ ” Martin said. “If it stayed peaceful for several more hours, I don’t think anything would have happened. There were trash cans set on fire and they were encircling police cars and trying to break police car windows.” Martin estimated there were more than 100 officers on the scene, including many called from neighboring departments, the Cumberland County Sheriff’s Office, and the Maine State Police. The Maine Department of Transportation shut down Exit 7, which leads to Franklin Street and the epicenter of the confrontation, in both directions. Cumberland County District Attorney Jonathan Sahrbeck said he will be reviewing police reports and other information before making a decision on how to proceed with any charges. “We are still going to be looking at the cases and making sure that we get all the information we can before we make any charging decisions at the DA’s office,” Sahrbeck said Tuesday. “So we don’t know exactly how we’re going to proceed at this time.” In 2016, a group of 17 Black Lives Matter protesters were arrested after a march in Portland. But a plea deal between the protesters and then-District Attorney Stephanie Anderson fell apart because the parties could not agree on the terms of a restorative justice meeting. A judge later denied Anderson’s attempt to restore the criminal charges, and the prosecutor did not pursue a meeting further. Sahrbeck said he was not yet sure whether restorative justice would be the right approach in these cases. “Obviously that didn’t work out as the parties initially thought it would,” Sahrbeck said. “I’m never going to rule out anything on day one. Restorative justice is something we’re trying to use a lot more in my office right now.” The clash with Portland police was one among hundreds of rallies across the country involving millions of Americans on Monday night. Not since the civil rights movement of the 1960s has the United States seen such widespread urban uprisings that organizers say are a reaction to decades of unrelenting, systemic racism and police forces that operates with impunity, even when officers kill and maim the citizens they’re sworn to protect. The arrest tally eclipses the 18 demonstrators who were charged in 2016, after a group protesting the killing of two black men in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and in a suburb of St. Paul, Minnesota, blocked traffic along Commercial Street in the Old Port on a busy Friday night. Those charges were eventually dropped after a disputed restorative justice meeting fell apart before it could begin. This story will be updated.

The Lewiston Middle School student said he supported the cause that drew more than 350 people to the impromptu march to demand justice in the wake of the May 25 killing of George Floyd by police in Minnesota. “We’re getting killed for walking in the streets,” Said said. “These cops keep shooting us for dead.” In the hope of forging a better future, a racially mixed and mostly young crowd marched more than five miles through Lewiston and Auburn on Monday afternoon holding signs and chanting for justice. “For too long, black lives have been taken too early,” said Lewiston City Council member Safiya Khalid. It has to stop, she told the crowd from the steps of the police station. “No more. No more violence. No more senseless killings,” Khalid told the cheering crowd. “It has gone on for way too long.” Some of the signs held by marchers contained lists of the familiar names of black men and women who died at the hands of the police or white vigilantes. Cliff Odle, who teaches theater at Bates College, said he came because his 13-year-old daughter heard about the rally and he thought they should attend. Odle called the event “a necessary action” to give a voice to the demand for justice that is ringing throughout the country. Lewiston, he said, is not an island, but part of a whole that has seen too many die like Floyd, pinned beneath a police officer’s knee as he begged, fruitlessly, for breath. The officer has been charged with third-degree murder as authorities in Minnesota continue to investigate. Three other officers at the scene of Floyd’s death were fired. The killing has set off a surge of protests across the country that have included peaceful demonstrations by millions, as well as clashes between police and more militant protesters in many large cities and some smaller communities. Lewiston Mayor Mark Cayer, who marched along with the crowd, said he knows there is frustration and anger that he can see plainly. But, he said, he hasn’t “lived it” like so many non-white Americans, so he came to hear them. It is important, Cayer said, for the city “to provide a safe place” for the community speak. The police were eager to offer protection for the marchers, blocking off intersections and shutting down traffic as at least 350 people hoofed around Lewiston and Auburn chanting “No Justice/No Peace” and other slogans. Perhaps the most common one was a call and response, “Say his name/George Floyd” over and over, an effort to burrow his name and his death into the consciousness of the nation. The marchers set out from Kennedy Park about 3:15 p.m., headed down Chestnut Street to Lincoln Street before crossing the bridge into Auburn. Setting a brisk pace, they walked on Court Street until they reached Goff Street, proceeding to Dennison Street to Turner Street and then back across the bridge, down Lisbon Street and back to the park. Four miles in little more than an hour wasn’t quite enough. The marchers headed up Birch Street to Bartlett Street and then turned back to the park along Walnut Street. There were no serious problems for police along the route. At one point, a black man stood in front of a state police car for a minute, blocking its way, until he gave way to the pleading of other marchers to let the officer do his job. At the end of the march, a woman yelling that “All Lives Matter” drew a small crowd ready to argue, but they dispersed after a number of people urged them not to let her effort to antagonize them succeed. Odle said he was encouraged to see so many young people pushing for a more just world. His generation, he said, “dropped the ball,” but he’s determined to do what he can to create a better future for his children. As a black man, Odle said, he knows what it’s like to be pulled over by police while he’s driving or eyed suspiciously for matching some vague description of a possible criminal. It’s not how the country should be, he said. By the time the marchers reached the police station beside the park about 4:45 p.m., Khalid said she had long since lost her voice. But when offered a megaphone, she managed to get a few words out, even if most couldn’t hear them especially well. Khalid, the first elected city councilor from the Somali community in Lewiston, told them she is a black woman with black brothers. She said the country needs reform. Police need reform, Khalid added. To get the policy changes that will do the job, she said, is going to take work. “You are the change we want to see in this country,” Khalid told the crowd. “We need to get our ballots and votes,” Khalid said, and get involved in elections for local, state and national offices to make sure the best candidates win. “We have to do more,” she said. Then she asked the crowd, “What are you going to do?” The answer came loud and clear: “Vote! Vote! Vote!” Send questions/comments to the editors. « Previous Next » filed under:",0.0

The peaceful march stopped at the Sagadahoc County Courthouse, the Bath Police Department and ended in front of City Hall. Many protests, vigils and marches have taken place across the country in reaction to the death of George Floyd, a black man killed a week ago as a Minneapolis police officer held Floyd down with a knee to the back of Floyd’s neck. In Bath, protesters chanted “I can’t breathe,” in reference to Floyd and Eric Garner, a black man in New York who died while being restrained by a police officer. Both men were recorded saying “I can’t breathe” in the moments before their death, Devin Moore, 28, of Bath, said the march was an opportunity to unify the city where he’s lived most of his life. “Everybody’s affected by these things,” he said. While Black Lives Matter is the narrative, “It’s not just black people. It’s deeper than that.” Those who may not understand what it’s like to be black or experience racism also come to a Black Lives Matter march to become educated, Moore said. “I learn from everyone,” he said. “I learn not to judge.” Reporter Darcie Moore is not related to Devin Moore.

A white Minneapolis police officer is accused of kneeling on his neck for that amount of time before his death and has been charged with murder. Monday’s event was organized by several groups, including some Mount Blue Middle School students, a University of Maine at Farmington staff member and Mainers for Change.

Someone from the crowd said they need to work together to make change. “We need to use our privilege to dismantle racism,” Stephanie Harman of Farmington said following the march.

President Trump had announced he would soon be addressing the nation from the White House Rose Garden, as a 7 p.m. curfew in the city loomed and a mass of law enforcement, including U.S. Secret Service agents, Park Police and National Guardsmen, stood sentry, many dressed in riot gear. Moments before 6:30 p.m., just when Trump said he would begin his address, the officers suddenly marched forward, directly confronting the protesters as many held up their hands, saying, “Don’t shoot.” Soon, law enforcement officers were aggressively forcing the protesters back, firing tear gas and deploying flash bangs into the crowd to disperse them from the park for seemingly no reason. It was a jarring scene as police in the nation’s capital forcefully cleared young men and women gathered legally in a public park on a sunny evening, all of it on live television. With smoke still wafting and isolated tussles continuing in the crowd, Trump emerged in the Rose Garden for a dramatic split-screen of his own creation. “I am your president of law and order and an ally of all peaceful protesters,” he declared, before demanding that governors across the nation deploy the National Guard “in sufficient numbers that we dominate the streets.” And he warned that, if they refused, he would deploy the United States military “and quickly solve the problem for them.” As an additional show of force, Trump announced he was deploying even more of the military to Washington, D.C., giving it the feel of an armed, locked-down city after days of violent clashes, arson and looting. “As we speak I am dispatching thousands and thousands of heavily armed soldiers,” he said, as explosions rang out in the background. “We are putting everybody on warning.” Then, before departing, Trump announced he wasn’t done for the evening, and would be “going to pay my respects to a very very special place.” Moments later, the White House press pool was quickly summoned for a surprise movement. And soon after, Trump strolled out of the White House gates — something he had never done — and walked across the park that had just been cleared to accommodate his movements. Trump walked slowly, followed by an entourage of his most senior aides, security and reporters. The faint residue of pepper spray hung in the air, stinging eyes and prompting coughing. Sections of the park and surrounding sidewalks were strewn with garbage, including plastic water bottles and other debris. Some sections had been scrawled with graffiti. Trump crossed H Street and walked toward St. John’s Church, the landmark pale yellow building where every president, including Trump, has prayed. It had been damaged Sunday night in a protest fire. Trump, standing alone in front of cameras, then raised a black-covered Bible for reporters to see. “We have a great country,” Trump said. “Greatest country in the world.” He didn’t talk about Floyd, the church or the damage it had suffered, or the peaceful protesters police had cleared. He said nothing about the coronavirus pandemic, the parallel crisis that has continued to ravage the nation as Trump campaigns for a second presidential term. And then he invited his attorney general, national security adviser, chief of staff, press secretary and defense secretary — all white — to join him for another round of photos before he walked back across the park to the White House. At one point, he stopped and pumped his fist in the air at National Guard members in the distance. “We’re going to keep it nice and safe,” he said. Rabbi Jack Moline, the president of Interfaith Alliance, slammed the fact that peaceful protesters near the White House were gassed and shot with rubber bullets so Trump could hold his photo op. “Seeing President Trump stand in front of St. John’s Episcopal Church while holding a Bible in response to calls for racial justice — right after using military force to clear peaceful protesters out of the area — is one of the most flagrant misuses of religion I have ever seen,” Moline said in a statement.

1623406686,2020-06-02 07:34:43,Biden vows to take on systemic racism,https://www.centralmaine.com/2020/06/02/biden-vows-to-take-on-systemic-racism/,en,False,,29592,onlinesentinel.com,http://www.onlinesentinel.com#spider,"WILMINGTON, Del. — Joe Biden vowed to address institutional racism in his first 100 days in office as he sought to elevate his voice Monday in the exploding national debate over racism and police brutality. The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee offered emotional support and promised bold action during an in-person discussion with black leaders in Delaware and a subsequent virtual meeting with big-city mayors who are grappling with racial tensions and frustrated by a lack of federal support. “Hate just hides. It doesn’t go away, and when you have somebody in power who breathes oxygen into the hate under the rocks, it comes out from under the rocks,” Biden told more than a dozen African American leaders gathered at a church in downtown Wilmington, his face mask lowered around his chin as he spoke. Without offering specifics, he promised to “deal with institutional racism” and set up a police oversight body in his first 100 days in office, if elected. The former vice president also said he’d be releasing an economic plan focused on education, housing and “access to capital” and investments, especially for minority Americans, later this month. “I really do believe that the blinders have been taken off. I think this tidal wave is moving,” Biden told the mayors of Atlanta, Chicago, Los Angeles and St. Paul, Minnesota. “I realize we’ve got to do something big, we can do it, and everyone will benefit from it.” Largely sheltering in place amid the coronavirus, Biden has struggled in recent weeks to be heard from his makeshift home TV studio over the noise of dueling national crises. But after another night of violent protests, he ventured out into public for the second time in two days and just the third time since the pandemic arrived in mid-March. His hopeful and collaborative approach marked a sharp contrast to that of President Donald Trump, who has made little effort to unify the country. The Republican president slammed governors as “weak” during a video teleconference on Monday and demanded tougher crackdowns on protesters. Trump also lashed out at Biden on Twitter, writing that “Sleepy Joe Biden’s people are so Radical Left that they are working to get the Anarchists out of jail, and probably more.” Biden’s softer style may foreshadow how he presents himself in the five months before the presidential election, emphasizing calm and competence as a contrast to a mercurial president. It is an approach that carries the risk of being drowned out by Trump’s much louder voice. “He’s not in office, and he certainly does not have the megaphone like the person currently occupying the White House does, but I do think our people are looking for someone who can make them feel better during these extremely tough times,” said Rep. Val Demings of Florida, whom Biden is considering as a running mate. “America just needs to be reassured that there’s someone who’s understanding, someone who’s willing to say, ‘Yes, we do have some issues,’ and someone who’s willing to address it.” Biden delivered a well-received address on Friday calling on white people to shoulder the responsibility of ending America’s systemic racism. But he was largely out of sight over the weekend, which marked the fifth anniversary of the death of his son Beau Biden from brain cancer. Biden and his wife, Jill, marked Memorial Day by laying a wreath at a veterans’ memorial near his Wilmington home last week, and the former vice president’s campaign posted pictures of him visiting a protest site in the city on Sunday afternoon. Earlier, he wrote a post on Medium expressing empathy for those despairing about the police killing of George Floyd. In the early moments of Monday’s gathering at the Bethel AME church in Wilmington, Biden listened quietly and took notes. All the attendees, including Biden, wore face masks but lowered them as they spoke. “The vice president came to hear from us. This is a homeboy,” pastor Sylvester Beaman said before everyone bowed their heads in prayer. Biden’s standing with the black community weighs heavily as he works to deny Trump a second term. African Americans rescued Biden’s flailing primary campaign, but it’s unclear if they will turn out for him in large numbers in November. “I want to make something clear. I don’t expect anything from the black community,” Biden said Monday, insisting he has never taken its support for granted. The former vice president has been doing cleanup since telling a prominent black radio host a week and a half ago that African Americans who back Trump “ain’t black.” Yet the mayors who spoke with Biden, three of whom are black, were clearly frustrated and angry with Trump, who has offered military support to address violent protests while denying them federal support to address the coronavirus fallout and repeatedly attacking them on social media. “To see the president of the United States say that he’s going to send the military into our communities but hadn’t mentioned sending a single dime of support into our communities, speaks to where we are in America,” said Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms. Much of Biden’s campaign strategy centers on trying to draw a contrast with Trump on temperament and values. He has called the White House contest a battle for the soul of the nation and has been particularly forceful in condemning Trump’s handling of moments of racial tension. In an election that is likely to be a referendum on the sitting president, some Biden aides say privately that the best plan may be to let Trump do himself in. Yet there is also a recognition that Biden needs to do more than simply wait for voters who may be turned off by Trump to turn toward him. Some Democrats who have criticized Biden for not being more visible during the onset of the coronavirus said he is making the right moves now. “I’m sure they have some reluctance, understandably, right now to politicize it. That’s not who he is,” said Democratic strategist James Carville. “There might be a time for eloquence, but I think that simplicity is eloquence right now.” Send questions/comments to the editors. « Previous Next »",0.0
1623406663,2020-06-02 11:23:07,"Biden: Trump ‘consumed’ by ego, not leading during national crisis",https://www.centralmaine.com/2020/06/02/biden-trump-consumed-by-ego-not-leading-during-national-crisis/,en,False,,29592,onlinesentinel.com,http://www.onlinesentinel.com#spider,"PHILADELPHIA — Joe Biden mounted one of his most aggressive attacks against President Trump on Tuesday, deriding the commander in chief’s disregard of core constitutional values and blistering him for being “more interested in power than in principle.” “He thinks division helps him,” the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee said in a speech at Philadelphia’s City Hall. “This narcissism has become more important than the nation’s well-being.” Biden seized on police driving back peaceful protesters near the White House on Monday so Trump could briefly pose with a Bible in front of nearby St. John’s Church. “If he opened it instead of brandishing it, he could have learned something,” Biden said as he chided authorities for using “tear gas and flash grenades in order to stage a photo op.” Biden said Trump “might also want to open the U.S. Constitution. If he did, he’d find the First Amendment. It protects the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.” Trump senior advisor Kellyanne Conway denied that the president directed authorities’ actions to move back the protesters and bristled at suggestions the church visit was merely a photo op. She countered that Biden and other critics had no basis to second-guess what was in the president’s heart and his intentions. Still, Biden’s address marked a new phase of a presidential campaign that had been effectively frozen for more than two months by the spread of the coronavirus. The former vice president is now emerging from his Delaware home to confront Trump and using in-person appearances to offer direct competition with the president, rather than relying on virtual events that often failed to garner a lot of attention. It was the third consecutive day that Biden made a public appearance and the first time he’s been out of the state since March. His remarks were carried live on the three major cable news networks. Biden spoke as upheaval in the wake of George Floyd’s death has spread around the country. While Biden spoke, the National Guard maintained a visible presence to defend public buildings as Philadelphia continues to face sustained violent protests. Several buildings adjacent to City Hall, including banks, convenience stores and hotels, were boarded up. He spoke of the “tug of war between the American ideal that we are all created equal and the harsh reality that racism has long torn us apart.” “The honest truth is both elements are part of the American character,” he said. Since the early days of his candidacy, Biden has framed the election as a “battle for the soul of the nation.” He went into greater detail on Tuesday about what that meant and the questions voters should ask themselves. “I ask every American to look at where we are now and think anew: Is this who we are?” he said. “Is this who we want to be? Is this what we pass on to our kids’ and grandkids’ lives? Fear and finger-pointing rather than hope and the pursuit of happiness? Incompetence and anxiety? Self-absorption and selfishness?” The tone was part of Biden’s effort to cast himself as a “consoler in chief” in stark contrast to Trump’s blunt, confrontational style. While he noted that his anguish over the death of his son Beau five years ago from cancer isn’t the same as the sadness felt by those protesting police brutality, he said he understood the hopelessness that can come with grief. “Like many of you, I know what it’s like to grieve,” Biden said. “I know what it feels like when you’re thinking you can’t go on.” He said “bad cops should be dealt with severely and swiftly” and offered examples of how he might ease racial tensions and govern. The former vice president called on Congress to act now on legislation that would place a federal ban on police using chokeholds. Biden also promised that, if elected, he would increase access to health care and improve the pay of first-responders and other workers who have stayed on jobs deemed essential during the pandemic. But Biden’s speech was perhaps most notable for its ferocity, even though his criticism of Trump is common. He accused the president of being more worried about himself than the nation at a time when it “is crying out for leadership.” “This president today is part of the problem and accelerates it,” Biden said, adding that Trump is “consumed with his blinding ego.” Biden offered a stark departure from Trump, who tweeted Tuesday that Washington “had no problems last night” and cited “many arrests,” as well as “overwhelming force” and “Domination,” for which he thanked himself. Trump has embraced the language of confrontation and war, seeking to be a “president of law and order,” and betting that voters will want a more forceful approach at a time of national tumult and racial unrest. Katrina Pierson, a senior adviser to the president’s re-election campaign, said Biden’s speech “obviously made the crass political calculation that unrest in America is a benefit to his candidacy.” “President Trump is restoring the nation to order and is clearly the leader we need to return the country to peace and prosperity,” Pierson said in a statement. Despite his more confrontational approach, Biden was direct about the limits of his ability to singularly reconcile the nation’s differences. He was careful to note that his administration won’t be able to fix everything, especially not all at once. “I know that the presidency, that’s a very big job,” he said. “Nobody will get it right every time, and I won’t either.” But he vowed not to “traffic in fear and division.” “I won’t fan the flames of hate,” Biden said. “I’ll seek to heal the racial wounds that have long plagued our country, not use them for political gain.” Send questions/comments to the editors. « Previous Next » filed under:",0.0
1623406657,2020-06-02 11:41:13,Police arrest 23 during overnight clashes with demonstrators,https://www.centralmaine.com/2020/06/02/police-arrest-23-during-overnight-clashes-with-demonstrators/,en,False,,29592,onlinesentinel.com,http://www.onlinesentinel.com#spider,"Portland police arrested 23 people during an anti-racism demonstration that brought up to 1,000 people into city streets Monday evening and lasted into the early-morning hours. The protesters amassed outside the Portland police station in a confrontation that moved around the downtown area and lasted until nearly 2 a.m., police said. Officers from 15 other police departments joined Portland police and stood shoulder-to-shoulder carrying wooden batons and plastic riot shields. Everyone arrested during the demonstration posted bail by Tuesday morning, said police spokesman Lt. Robert Martin. All but one person was charged with failure to disperse, a misdemeanor. One man, the driver of a tractor-trailer truck that entered the protest area near the intersection of Middle and Franklin streets, was charged with reckless conduct with dangerous weapon, a class-C felony. Throughout the night, there was a push and pull between organizers who sought to keep the demonstrations peaceful, and people who threw water bottles and other objects at police, destroyed property and defaced businesses. At one point, some police knelt with protesters, drawing cheers from the crowd. Others talked with protesters from the police line, but most officers remained silent or did not react or engage. Chief Frank Clark released a statement Tuesday afternoon in which he expressed disgust at the killing of George Floyd, the 46-year-old Minneapolis man who died in police custody when an officer pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck for nearly nine minutes, until he lost consciousness and stopped breathing. But Clark said a smaller segment of demonstrators was determined to cause trouble, leading to the harsher response by officers. “Our goal remains providing a safe environment for those wishing to peacefully express their views and First Amendment rights,” Clark said in the statement. “We are fortunate that no one was seriously injured and that most of the property damage was minimal. Unfortunately a committed smaller segment of this group ended up making this event anything other than a peaceful and lawful protest. They took the opportunity to commit acts of violence, damage public and private property and place my officers and the public at risk. We will not stand for such criminal behavior.” Attempts to reach the demonstration’s organizer, David Thete, were unsuccessful Monday evening. A number for Thete was no longer accepting incoming calls, and a message sent to him on social media was not returned. Police say demonstrators on Monday night threw rocks, bottles, bricks and urine at police, and several trash cans were set on fire in the Old Port. Around 9 p.m. as night fell, demonstrators at one point encircled two police vehicles near the station and began striking them, Martin said. Demonstrators threatened police with death, police said in the release. Four businesses were burglarized and five had windows broken or saw other acts of criminal mischief; officers also cited two dozen instances of graffiti in the Old Port area. As the night progressed, cars revved their engines and sped down empty streets. Some passing motorists honked in support of the demonstration, while others antagonized them – one man driving a large black pickup truck reached out from his open window, made the shape of a gun with his fingers and mimicked shooting a group of young black men standing on a corner, two blocks from the epicenter of the confrontation, before driving off. Police said one officer was struck in the face with a water bottle but did not need medical attention, and a small number of demonstrators who were sprayed by officers with pepper spray required assistance from paramedics. The demonstration began peacefully, with hundreds staging a die-in on Middle Street in front of the police station. Protesters re-established a makeshift memorial on the police department steps dedicated to those who have been killed by police across the nation. “There’s no bright line. We don’t say, ’10 o’clock we open the road back up,’ ” Martin said. “If it stayed peaceful for several more hours, I don’t think anything would have happened. There were trash cans set on fire and they were encircling police cars and trying to break police car windows.” Martin estimated there were more than 100 officers on the scene, including many called from neighboring departments, the Cumberland County Sheriff’s Office, and the Maine State Police. The Maine Department of Transportation shut down Exit 7, which leads to Franklin Street and the epicenter of the confrontation, in both directions. Cumberland County District Attorney Jonathan Sahrbeck said he will be reviewing police reports and other information before making a decision on how to proceed with any charges. “We are still going to be looking at the cases and making sure that we get all the information we can before we make any charging decisions at the DA’s office,” Sahrbeck said Tuesday. “So we don’t know exactly how we’re going to proceed at this time.” In 2016, a group of 17 Black Lives Matter protesters were arrested after a march in Portland. But a plea deal between the protesters and then-District Attorney Stephanie Anderson fell apart because the parties could not agree on the terms of a restorative justice meeting. A judge later denied Anderson’s attempt to restore the criminal charges, and the prosecutor did not pursue a meeting further. Sahrbeck said he was not yet sure whether restorative justice would be the right approach in these cases. “Obviously that didn’t work out as the parties initially thought it would,” Sahrbeck said. “I’m never going to rule out anything on day one. Restorative justice is something we’re trying to use a lot more in my office right now.” The clash with Portland police was one among hundreds of rallies across the country involving millions of Americans on Monday night. Not since the civil rights movement of the 1960s has the United States seen such widespread urban uprisings that organizers say are a reaction to decades of unrelenting, systemic racism and police forces that operates with impunity, even when officers kill and maim the citizens they’re sworn to protect. The arrest tally eclipses the 18 demonstrators who were charged in 2016, after a group protesting the killing of two black men in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and in a suburb of St. Paul, Minnesota, blocked traffic along Commercial Street in the Old Port on a busy Friday night. Those charges were eventually dropped after a disputed restorative justice meeting fell apart before it could begin. This story will be updated.

Dr. Nirav Shah, director of the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said at an afternoon media briefing that large crowds are a risk factor but no cases have yet been connected to protests in Maine. In addition to Monday’s protest, there also have been several demonstrations in recent weeks against Gov. Janet Mills’ reopening plan, which has limited business activity to reduce the risk of spreading COVID-19, the disease caused by he coronavirus. Shah said it could take days or weeks before cases emerge that could be linked to the protests. It was about a week after a packed Lake of the Ozarks pool party on Memorial Day weekend in Missouri that a positive case of COVID-19 was detected in a partygoer, according to news reports. “Close congregate settings can generate a high number of cases in a short amount of time,” Shah said. “Just because we haven’t yet detected any outbreaks of that nature is really more a sign of not enough time has elapsed yet.” The CDC reported Tuesday that 60 more people have recovered from COVID-19, and the number of active cases declined. Overall, there have been 2,377 cases in Maine since the pandemic began. With a total of 1,646 recoveries and 94 deaths, the number of active cases stood at 637, down from 674 on Monday. Protests against police brutality against black Americans have taken place in Maine following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis, generating increasingly large crowds. About 1,000 people protested in downtown Portland on Monday night, many packed shoulder-to-shoulder. Many were not wearing masks. “I would ask everyone who is going out there in any circumstance to please wear a face covering and if possible maintain as much physical distance between one person and another,” Shah said. “In any event, the more people wearing face coverings, whatever the situation, overall the less likelihood of transmission there is.” Gov. Janet Mills’ executive order currently prohibits gatherings of more than 50 people. Jeanne Lambrew, health and human services commissioner, said protests should be limited to 50 people or fewer. “We know it’s harder to do that kind of physical distancing (staying 6 feet apart) when you exceed 50 people gathering,” Lambrew said. Outrage over police brutality flared after former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin was caught in a bystander’s video kneeling on the neck of Floyd, 46, whom they had taken into custody. Police said he matched the description of someone who passed a counterfeit $20 bill inside a convenience store. Chauvin – who has been arrested and charged with third-degree murder in Floyd’s death on May 25 – pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck for nearly 9 minutes as Floyd said he could not breathe. Floyd lost consciousness and was pronounced dead a short time later at a nearby hospital. The three other officers who stood by and watched were fired but have not been charged. Protesters in downtown Portland held a “die-in,” lying face down on the ground and chanting, “I can’t breathe.” In addition to concerns over protest crowd sizes, Maine is entering tourist season, and even if not as many people are vacationing this summer, Maine could still get a flood of tourists from COVID-19 hot spots such as Massachusetts, New York and New Jersey. Traditionally, crowds have packed into Portland’s Old Port, Bar Harbor, Acadia National Park, Fort Williams, Old Orchard Beach and many other favorite tourist destinations. Reopening continues The five COVID-19 deaths reported Tuesday included two women and a man in their 70s from Cumberland County, a man in his 60s from Penobscot County and a woman in her 100s from Cumberland County. The latest case numbers paint a mixed picture as reopening continues. Testing and contact tracing have been greatly expanded, increasing the state’s ability to contain the virus’ spread. Forty-eight Mainers are currently hospitalized with COVID-19, unchanged from Monday. Among those, 16 are in critical care and 10 are using ventilators to support their breathing, roughly the same numbers as Monday. The state has 156 available intensive care unit beds at hospitals and 245 available ventilators. Hospitalization rates and death trends are key metrics for tracking the progress of the virus and efforts to contain transmission. Intensive care beds and ventilators are critical tools for treating hospitalized patients, and epidemiologists closely monitor the demand for these resources as they study the spread of the disease. The rate of positive tests out of the total – another key metric that shows how effective the state is at finding COVID-19 cases and then tracking close contacts and isolating people to prevent further spread – dipped below 5 percent for the first time Tuesday, to 4.95 percent out of 57,635 total tests. The goal, Shah has said, is to drive down the positivity rate to the 2-3 percent range, similar to South Korea, which has an effective tracing and testing program. Maine’s positivity rate has hovered around 5 percent, but was closer to 6 percent about two weeks ago. When Maine expanded testing, the positivity rate started to decline. Shah said that expanded testing has found more cases of asymptomatic people who have COVID-19, and those people are then isolated. If the state can find asymptomatic COVID-19 carriers, Shah said, that is an effective way to prevent transmission, because if people don’t know they are contagious, they are more likely to engage with others and spread the virus. Also on Tuesday, the Maine DHHS launched the “Keep it Maine” campaign to encourage Mainers to follow physical distancing guidelines, hygiene and other ways to keep Maine among the lowest rates of COVID-19 in the nation. Maine has the eighth-lowest number of positive cases per capita in the country, and it is spending $250,000 in federal funding on the outreach campaign. “We stay the course and we work together to do what’s right for our loved ones, friends and neighbors,” Lambrew said in a statement. “The campaign’s theme is built around this shared achievement. Let’s keep it up. Let’s keep it Maine.” On Monday, the state dropped the distinction between essential and nonessential businesses, which means all retail stores can now open, with customer limits based on square footage and other restrictions. Parks, beaches, lodging places and campgrounds also may open to patrons, provided they’re Maine residents or out-of-staters who have quarantined for two weeks. Restaurants in Cumberland, York and Androscoggin County are permitted to open for outdoor dining, but will have to wait longer before allowing patrons inside. Mills has not set a date and that uncertainty has led to criticism from the restaurant industry. Lambrew said on Tuesday that no decisions have been made on a new date for indoor dining for those three counties. Previously established restrictions on public transportation remain in place and should be used for essential purposes only. Restrictions on certain gatherings, including religious services, have increased from 10 to 50. The governor’s mandatory 14-day quarantine for out-of-state visitors remains in place, even amid legal challenges and as many in the hospitality industry have called on Mills to drop it. She has said she is looking at all options but has not found a safe alternative.

It was about a week after a packed Lake of the Ozarks pool party on Memorial Day weekend in Missouri that a positive case of COVID-19 was detected in a partygoer, according to news reports. “Close congregate settings can generate a high number of cases in a short amount of time,” Shah said. “Just because we haven’t yet detected any outbreaks of that nature is really more a sign of not enough time has elapsed yet.” The CDC reported Tuesday that 60 more people have recovered from COVID-19, and the number of active cases declined. Overall, there have been 2,377 cases in Maine since the pandemic began. With a total of 1,646 recoveries and 94 deaths, the number of active cases stood at 637, down from 674 on Monday. Protests against police brutality against black Americans have taken place in Maine following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis, generating increasingly large crowds. About 1,000 people protested in downtown Portland on Monday night, many packed shoulder-to-shoulder. Many were not wearing masks. “I would ask everyone who is going out there in any circumstance to please wear a face covering and if possible maintain as much physical distance between one person and another,” Shah said. “In any event, the more people wearing face coverings, whatever the situation, overall the less likelihood of transmission there is.” Gov. Janet Mills’ executive order currently prohibits gatherings of more than 50 people. Jeanne Lambrew, health and human services commissioner, said protests should be limited to 50 people or fewer. “We know it’s harder to do that kind of physical distancing (staying 6 feet apart) when you exceed 50 people gathering,” Lambrew said. Outrage over police brutality flared after former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin was caught in a bystander’s video kneeling on the neck of Floyd, 46, whom they had taken into custody. Police said he matched the description of someone who passed a counterfeit $20 bill inside a convenience store. Chauvin – who has been arrested and charged with third-degree murder in Floyd’s death on May 25 – pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck for nearly 9 minutes as Floyd said he could not breathe. Floyd lost consciousness and was pronounced dead a short time later at a nearby hospital. The three other officers who stood by and watched were fired but have not been charged. Protesters in downtown Portland held a “die-in,” lying face down on the ground and chanting, “I can’t breathe.” In addition to concerns over protest crowd sizes, Maine is entering tourist season, and even if not as many people are vacationing this summer, Maine could still get a flood of tourists from COVID-19 hot spots such as Massachusetts, New York and New Jersey. Traditionally, crowds have packed into Portland’s Old Port, Bar Harbor, Acadia National Park, Fort Williams, Old Orchard Beach and many other favorite tourist destinations. Reopening continues The five COVID-19 deaths reported Tuesday included two women and a man in their 70s from Cumberland County, a man in his 60s from Penobscot County and a woman in her 100s from Cumberland County. The latest case numbers paint a mixed picture as reopening continues. Testing and contact tracing have been greatly expanded, increasing the state’s ability to contain the virus’ spread. Forty-eight Mainers are currently hospitalized with COVID-19, unchanged from Monday. Among those, 16 are in critical care and 10 are using ventilators to support their breathing, roughly the same numbers as Monday. The state has 156 available intensive care unit beds at hospitals and 245 available ventilators. Hospitalization rates and death trends are key metrics for tracking the progress of the virus and efforts to contain transmission. Intensive care beds and ventilators are critical tools for treating hospitalized patients, and epidemiologists closely monitor the demand for these resources as they study the spread of the disease. The rate of positive tests out of the total – another key metric that shows how effective the state is at finding COVID-19 cases and then tracking close contacts and isolating people to prevent further spread – dipped below 5 percent for the first time Tuesday, to 4.95 percent out of 57,635 total tests. The goal, Shah has said, is to drive down the positivity rate to the 2-3 percent range, similar to South Korea, which has an effective tracing and testing program. Maine’s positivity rate has hovered around 5 percent, but was closer to 6 percent about two weeks ago. When Maine expanded testing, the positivity rate started to decline. Shah said that expanded testing has found more cases of asymptomatic people who have COVID-19, and those people are then isolated. If the state can find asymptomatic COVID-19 carriers, Shah said, that is an effective way to prevent transmission, because if people don’t know they are contagious, they are more likely to engage with others and spread the virus. Also on Tuesday, the Maine DHHS launched the “Keep it Maine” campaign to encourage Mainers to follow physical distancing guidelines, hygiene and other ways to keep Maine among the lowest rates of COVID-19 in the nation. Maine has the eighth-lowest number of positive cases per capita in the country, and it is spending $250,000 in federal funding on the outreach campaign. “We stay the course and we work together to do what’s right for our loved ones, friends and neighbors,” Lambrew said in a statement. “The campaign’s theme is built around this shared achievement. Let’s keep it up. Let’s keep it Maine.” On Monday, the state dropped the distinction between essential and nonessential businesses, which means all retail stores can now open, with customer limits based on square footage and other restrictions. Parks, beaches, lodging places and campgrounds also may open to patrons, provided they’re Maine residents or out-of-staters who have quarantined for two weeks. Restaurants in Cumberland, York and Androscoggin County are permitted to open for outdoor dining, but will have to wait longer before allowing patrons inside. Mills has not set a date and that uncertainty has led to criticism from the restaurant industry. Lambrew said on Tuesday that no decisions have been made on a new date for indoor dining for those three counties. Previously established restrictions on public transportation remain in place and should be used for essential purposes only. Restrictions on certain gatherings, including religious services, have increased from 10 to 50. The governor’s mandatory 14-day quarantine for out-of-state visitors remains in place, even amid legal challenges and as many in the hospitality industry have called on Mills to drop it. She has said she is looking at all options but has not found a safe alternative. Related Headlines Read our complete coverage of the coronavirus pandemic « Previous Next » filed under:",0.0

WASHINGTON — American cities erupted in violence and destruction in a seventh straight night of unrest, with several police officers shot or run over, amid boasts and threats from President Donald Trump to send in troops to ""dominate the streets."" In New York, nonviolent protests Monday night were punctuated by people smashing shop windows near Rockefeller Center and breaching the doors of Macy's flagship store on 34th Street, littering the pavement with broken glass. An SUV plowed into a group of officers at a demonstration in Buffalo, injuring three, including a state trooper who suffered a broken leg and a shattered pelvis. Demonstrations also broke out in such places as Philadelphia, where hundreds of protesters spilled onto a highway in the heart of the city; Atlanta, where police fired tear gas at demonstrators; and Nashville, where more than 60 National Guard members put down their riot shields at the request of peaceful protesters who had gathered in front of Tennessee's Capitol to honor George Floyd. Bystander Sean Jones, who watched as people ransacked luxury stores in New York over the weekend, said: ""People are doing this so next time, before they think about trying to kill another black person, they're going to be like, 'Damn, we don't want them out here doing this ... again.'"" The unrest in Minneapolis appeared to stabilize on the same day Floyd's brother made an impassioned plea for peace at the spot where a white police officer, Derek Chauvin, put his knee on the handcuffed black man's neck until he stopped breathing last week. Chauvin has been charged with murder. Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said Tuesday that prosecutors were working as fast as they can to determine if the three other officers at the scene should be charged, too. All four have been fired. The death toll from the unrest rose to at least nine, including two people killed in a Chicago suburb. More than 5,600 people nationwide have been arrested over the past week for such offenses as stealing, blocking highways and breaking curfew, according to a count by The Associated Press. Cities struggled to keep police in line and avoid instances of excessive force. The police chief in Louisville, Kentucky, was fired after a beloved restaurant owner was killed by police and National Guard members enforcing a curfew. In Richmond, Virginia, the police chief said officers who used tear gas on a group of peaceful protesters would be disciplined. An officer was shot shortly before midnight near the Circus Circus casino in Las Vegas. Police had no immediate word on the officer's condition. Four officers were shot in St. Louis; they were expected to recover. Trump, meanwhile, portrayed himself as a hard-nosed, law-and-order president, with police under federal command using tear gas to clear peaceful demonstrators from a park near the White House so that he could walk to a church and pose with a Bible. Emerging after two days out of public view, he threatened from the White House Rose Garden to deploy ""thousands and thousands"" of U.S. troops. The photo op at the house of worship known as the Church of the Presidents was condemned by Episcopal Bishop Mariann Edgar Budde. ""The president just used a Bible and one of the churches of my diocese as a backdrop for a message antithetical to the teachings of Jesus and everything that our church stands for,"" she said. A senior White House official said Tuesday that despite Trump's threats, the goal was to pressure governors to deploy National Guard units. The president was not rushing to use the Insurrection Act to send in the military, according to the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. For nearly a week since Floyd's death, largely peaceful protests by day have turned to chaos at night. ""We have been sitting on a powder keg for some time and it has burst,"" Philadelphia Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw said. Trump warned that if governors don't deploy the National Guard in sufficient numbers to ""dominate the streets,"" the U.S. military will step in to ""quickly solve the problem for them."" ""We have the greatest country in the world,"" the president declared. ""We're going to keep it safe."" As Trump spoke, tear gas canisters could be heard exploding. A military deployment by Trump to U.S. states would mark a stunning federal intervention rarely seen in modern American history. It drew comparisons to 1968, when Richard Nixon ran as the law-and-order candidate in the aftermath of riots following the assassination of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. Trump made little effort to address the grievances of black Americans and others outraged by Floyd's death and the scourge of police brutality, undermining what his reelection campaign had hoped would be increased appeal to African American voters. Federal law allows presidents to dispatch the military into states to suppress an insurrection or if a state is defying federal law, legal experts said. But officials in New York and other states asserted that the president does not have a unilateral right to send in troops against the will of local governments.",0.0

U.S. stock indexes are moving higher in early trading Tuesday, following broad gains in global markets as investors hope that the gradual lifting of coronavirus lockdown mandates will put economies ravaged by the outbreak on the path to recovery. The S&P 500 was up 0.4%, adding to gains from the day before. Financial, industrial and other stocks that would stand to benefit the most from a growing economy moved higher. Energy companies also rose as the price of crude oil headed higher. Bond yields were mostly higher, another sign of ebbing pessimism among investors. The modest gains have the S&P 500 on track for a three-day winning streak, extending the benchmark index's remarkable two-month rally off a steep skid in February and March as broad swaths of the U.S. economy ground to a halt due to the coronavirus pandemic. So far, Wall Street's momentum has not been derailed by the wave of daily unrest across the U.S. that began last week in Minneapolis as a protest over police brutality. Cities across the country have been rocked by violence and destruction for seven days in a row, spurring threats from the White House to send troops in to put down the unrest. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 189 points, or 0.7%, to 25,668. The Nasdaq composite was up 0.2%. Smaller company stocks had some of the biggest gains in the early going. The Russell 2000 index was up 0.8%. NASA astronauts launched into space by SpaceX on Saturday rang the opening bell from the International Space Station early Tuesday to kick off trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Stocks have now recouped most of their losses after the initial economic fallout from the coronavirus knocked the market into a breathtaking 34% skid in February and March. The S&P 500 is now down just under 10% from its all-time high in February. Investors are hoping that the worst of the recession has already passed, or will soon, as governments around the country and around the world slowly lift restrictions meant to corral the outbreak. In Europe, France's CAC 40 jumped 2.1% Tuesday as the country opened restaurants, cafes, parks and beaches and launched a contract tracing app to help keep tabs on new contagions. Germany's DAX, which had been closed Monday, caught up with previous global markets' gains and surged 3.7%. Britain's FTSE 100 added 0.9%. Markets in Asia closed broadly higher. While more countries and sectors are reopening, activity is expected to remain subdued as social distancing rules complicate plans to get back to business. And fears persist about a possible resurgence in coronavirus outbreaks in some countries. There were 34 new confirmed cases in Tokyo on Tuesday, seeming to reaffirm growing risks as people begin to mingle more in crowded commuter trains with the reopenings of more offices, schools, restaurants and stores. The daily numbers had dropped below 20 recently. Bond yields were mostly higher. The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 0.67% from 0.66% late Monday. Oil prices rose. Benchmark U.S. crude oil for July delivery was up 1.9% to $36.10 a barrel. Brent crude oil for August delivery rose 2% to $39.09 a barrel.",0.0

Other symbols came down elsewhere, leaving an empty pedestal and a bare flagpole. BIRMINGHAM, Ala. — The base of a massive Confederate monument in Alabama's largest city was all that remained Tuesday after crews dismantled the towering obelisk and trucked it away in pieces. Other symbols came down elsewhere, leaving an empty pedestal and a bare flagpole. Workers hired by the city of Birmingham began removing the top portion of the 115-year-old monument from Linn Park late Monday. By daybreak, the pedestal was the only thing left, covered with graffiti and pock marks from protests against police brutality. Sarah Collins Rudolph, whose sister Addie Mae Collins died in a racist church bombing that killed three other black girls in the city in 1963, came to see the remains. She lowered a protective face mask to take in the sight. ""I'm glad it's been removed because it has been so long. It's a hate monument,"" said Rudolph. She was seriously injured in the blast at 16th Street Baptist Church, and testified against Ku Klux Klansmen who were convicted in the killings. Confederate symbols across the South have been targeted for vandalism during demonstrations sparked by the death in police custody of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Now even some of their longtime defenders have decided to remove them. In Alexandria, Virginia, it was the United Daughters of the Confederacy that took action early Tuesday, removing the statue of a soldier gazing south from Old Town since 1889. And outside Tampa, Florida, a Sons of Confederate Veterans chapter lowered a huge Confederate battle flag that has long been flown in view of two interstate highways. Birmingham finally took action about a day after protesters tried to remove the monument themselves, during one of the many nationwide protests sparked by the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody.

Other symbols came down elsewhere, leaving an empty pedestal and a bare flagpole. Workers hired by the city of Birmingham began removing the top portion of the 115-year-old monument from Linn Park late Monday. By daybreak, the pedestal was the only thing left, covered with graffiti and pock marks from protests against police brutality. Sarah Collins Rudolph, whose sister Addie Mae Collins died in a racist church bombing that killed three other black girls in the city in 1963, came to see the remains. She lowered a protective face mask to take in the sight. “I’m glad it’s been removed because it has been so long. It’s a hate monument,” said Rudolph. She was seriously injured in the blast at 16th Street Baptist Church, and testified against Ku Klux Klansmen who were convicted in the killings. Confederate symbols across the South have been targeted for vandalism during demonstrations sparked by the death in police custody of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Now even some of their longtime defenders have decided to remove them. In Alexandria, Virginia, it was the United Daughters of the Confederacy that took action early Tuesday, removing the statue of a soldier gazing south from Old Town since 1889. And outside Tampa, Florida, a Sons of Confederate Veterans chapter lowered a huge Confederate battle flag that has long been flown in view of two interstate highways. Birmingham finally took action about a day after protesters tried to remove the monument themselves, during one of the many nationwide protests. Live video from overnight showed a flatbed truck hauling off the stone pieces in the early morning hours. It’s unclear where they were being taken.

Manchester police said they were made aware of the Facebook post May 30 inviting people to protest racism and police brutality. It referenced ""tipping police cars,"" ""graffiti"" and asking people to ""take examples from riots in other cities."" The post has since been removed. Police determined the post originated from a home in Ashland and arrested Daniel Zeron, 19. He was held on preventative detention and pleaded not guilty at his arraignment Tuesday. His trial is scheduled for July 6. Americans have been gathering to protest police brutality against black Americans following the killing of George Floyd, who was handcuffed and on the ground pleading for air as a white police officer pressed a knee on his neck for several minutes. Some demonstrations have turned violent, with people breaking into and stealing from businesses, smashing car windows and setting fires.

It's president. Trump spoke in the Rose Garden. What happened in the city last night was a total disgrace. The president urging states to dominate the situation, calling the nation's Governors Week in a Monday conference call and going a step further during his prepared remarks. If a city or state refuses to take the actions that are necessary to defend the life and property of their residents, then I will deploy the United States military and quickly solve the problem for them. That message received immediate pushback. I say Thank you, but no, thank you. I care more about them. Then some of the noise I heard on a morning focal. Meanwhile, after protesters were cleared, the president walking across the street to ST John's Episcopal Church, which was damaged in a fire Sunday, stopping to hold up a Bible, a move condemned by church officials. I just can't believe what my eyes see tonight, Advertisement What you need to know about your rights if you're planning to take part in protests Share Shares Copy Link Copy Every American has the right to demonstrate peacefully. It's right there in the First Amendment. But it's not as simple as showing up with a sign.There are some measures officials can use to limit protests, and it's easy to accidentally tiptoe into legally murky territory if you don't know the specifics.So before you go, read up.Timothy Zick is a professor of government and citizenship at the College of William & Mary Law School. He specializes in constitutional law and the First Amendment, and he's written several books about both, including 2009's ""Speech Out of Doors: Preserving First Amendment Liberties in Public Spaces.""Emerson Sykes is a staff attorney with the ACLU's Speech, Technology and Privacy Project, who studies free speech protections under the First Amendment. Previously, he worked for Africa at the International Center for Not-for-Profit Law to protect free speech.1. What are my rights as a protester?The First Amendment gives Americans the right to assemble peacefully and air our grievances. Historically, we've relied on protests to hold power to account — think the March on Washington in 1963 for civil rights or the March for Our Lives demonstration in 2018 for gun control.The government can't stop you from peacefully protesting, but they can impose some restrictions on the time, place and manner of the protest — for example, barring protesters from walking onto a public highway or instituting a curfew that affects when protests end, Sykes said.They can't block a protest simply because of its content, though.If protests are planned in advance, organizers may obtain a permit so law enforcement can block off public spaces for them to demonstrate, Sykes said.There are protections, though, for ""spontaneous protests"" that spawn in response to current events, like the protests that spawned after George Floyd's death, he said.The First Amendment does not continue to protect protests that escalate to violence or the destruction of private or public property, he said.That's when law enforcement has the right to end them and deescalate threats of violence, he said.2. Where can and can't I protest?A slew of public spaces are OK for protests — sidewalks, city parks, streets and other public forums are usually lawful, Sykes said.Some states require you file a permit to block off streets, and the right to assembly doesn't give you the automatic right to march on a public highway, Zick said.People can be arrested or cited for blocking passage, he said.On private property, you don't have the right to assemble.Zick called it the ""no man's land"" in terms of the First Amendment, and police can move you off the property and keep you from demonstrating there.They may even have that right to move you even if you're on public property. Special rules apply to government buildings because protests may disrupt business going on inside, Sykes said.If the protest was permitted, you should be allowed to stay where you are — but leaving the permitted protest site may unintentionally lead you into prohibited places, he said.3. Can police or local leaders tell us to disperse?It depends, Sykes said: If a mayor pleads with people to go home, you have no legal obligation to comply.But police and local government can order you to leave, say, if they've imposed a curfew, as long as they give you ample notice to leave safely, Sykes said.If you stay on the street past a curfew — or if you protest on private property — you may be cited or arrested.4. What can I record?You have the right to take photos and videos of what's happening at a protest in a public place, and you can record police, too.Different states have different rules about audio recording and sharing that without the consent of the people whose voices you recorded, but the visual portion of videos and photos are always protected by the First Amendment, Sykes said.If you're interfering with legitimate police operations, they can ask you to move. It's best to videotape them from a safe distance.Police can't ask you to give them your phone or forcibly confiscate it without a search warrant, which they would've needed to obtain from a judge, he said.If they demand your phone, though, comply to avoid escalating the confrontation. Afterward, you can file a police misconduct complaint or contact the ACLU, he said.5. Someone took a picture of my face at a public protest. Is that allowed?At a public protest in the United States, you consent to a photo just by being there. Anyone who photographs you protesting in a public place may have a right to use your image, and you may see images of yourself in the media or online, Zick said.6. What should I pack to stay safe at a protest?Pack light, Sykes said. He suggests you bring water and a snack at minimum. If you bring a bag, prepare for it to be searched.In a pandemic, wearing a mask can keep you from breathing in droplets containing coronavirus. Coming within close contact of other protesters could expose you to their spit or sneezes, which may carry the coronavirus.Of course, keep an ID on your person, too.And if you fear you'll be arrested and will need legal help, memorize the number to a local or national law organization that could assist you in getting out of jail and handling your case afterward, Sykes said.7. What can — and can't — police do during a protest?It's the responsibility of police to protect your right to peaceful assembly.They're also empowered to uphold law and order, which gives them broad authority to deescalate threats of violence how they see fit.How they deescalate that violence depends on local laws and the circumstances under which they use them, which can be difficult to prove in court if you believe they used force unlawfully, Zick said.Like Sykes said, police do not have the right to search your phone or personal devices without a warrant, which only a judge can grant them.They also don't have permission to delete content from your phone, so if they tell you to delete a video you took or delete it themselves, they're in the wrong, he said.8. What can I do if a police officer stops me?Be polite. Don't resist.Ask them if you're free to go after speaking with them, Sykes said.If they say yes, calmly walk away and rejoin the protest if it's safe to.If they say no, and they detain you, don't resist and keep calm, Sykes said. Ask them what crime you're suspected of committing.9. What can I do if I get arrested?Some people get arrested intentionally as a form of civil disobedience. But whether or not you planned to get handcuffed, you shouldn't resist arrest, Sykes said.It's the best chance you have to stay safe.During your arrest, you can remain silent, as is your right, Sykes said.In some states, police are permitted to know your name if they ask, but they don't have the right to know where you're from or your citizenship status, he said.You can also ask for a lawyer — remember that number you held onto for legal support.If you're booked into jail, call a lawyer immediately, Sykes said.Police can't listen in on your call if you're phoning a lawyer, but they can listen in if you're calling a friend or family member, so be aware, he said.10. What can I do if I feel law enforcement or other officials violated my rights?You can sue for civil rights violations.You're allowed to do that under Section 1983 of federal law, which covers violations by state actors and police who violate First Amendment rights to assemble, speak and petition.Some protesters file large class-action suits that are occasionally successful, and sometimes authorities can pay damages when they decide litigation isn't worth it, Zick said.But qualified immunity can shield officers from civil liability if they didn't violate a clearly established law, he said.Qualified immunity is a legal doctrine that protects police officers accused of interfering with constitutional rights from being liable unless they violated a clearly established and defined law.The lines are blurred at protests of what police are allowed to do and what constitutes overreaching, so ""clearly established"" constitutional rights are difficult to determine, Zick said.In this way, many police officers are protected by qualified immunity, Sykes said.""Those cases are difficult to win and expensive in terms of personal time and resources,"" Zick said. ""Naturally, I think a lot of the protesters whose rights may well have been violated may not pursue cases.""11. Can my workplace fire me if they find out I attended a protest?That depends on the contract you made with your employer when you were hired, but yes, it's possible, Sykes said.You have stronger constitutional protections for what you do outside of work, but depending on what you agreed on when you were hired, a company may be able to terminate your employment, he said.",0.0

Advertisement Police take a knee, drawing cheers, support from protesters in Fort Worth, Texas Share Shares Copy Link Copy Despite some tense moments during protests in Fort Worth, Texas, officers and the police chief drew praise when they kneeled with protesters to show support.Protesters there voiced concerns once again Monday night, drawing attention to deaths of black people by police officers. But when a black police officer responding to the crowds kneeled to show support and other officers joined, a crowd erupted into praise, prompting protesters to shake the hands of police and hug them. Protesters in Fort Worth have been noting deaths such as George Floyd, who died on Memorial Day in Minneapolis after an officer pressed his knee on his neck for more than eight minutes. The officer, who was since fired, now faces third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter charges.Crowds there also have called attention to Atatiana Jefferson, whose family said she was playing video games with her nephew when a Fort Worth officer shot her in her home in October. The officer resigned and has been indicted on a murder charge. Later Monday, police in riot gear responded to the crowds, causing confusion, but police chief Ed Kraus took a knee and prayed with people, and officers in riot gear later did, too, the Fort Worth Star-Telegram reported.""I think it's a good step,"" Kraus said.

The March on Washington for jobs and freedom culminated with King speaking from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C. King was joined in the march that day by over 250,000 civil rights supporters. It was notable for reference to the Emancipation Proclamation, which freed slaves in 1863, but, as King stated, ""One hundred years later, the Negro is still not free. One hundred years later, the life of the Negro is still sadly crippled by the manacles of segregation and the chains of discrimination."" The speech's most often referenced quote, ""I have a dream,"" came as the activist spoke of ""the American dream"" and his hope that one day America would live up to the statement ""that all men are created equal."" King's full speech can be read below, along with video provided below that: I am happy to join with you today in what will go down in history as the greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of our nation. Five score years ago, a great American, in whose symbolic shadow we stand today, signed the Emancipation Proclamation. This momentous decree came as a great beacon light of hope to millions of Negro slaves who had been seared in the flames of withering injustice. It came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of their captivity. But one hundred years later, the Negro still is not free. One hundred years later, the life of the Negro is still sadly crippled by the manacles of segregation and the chains of discrimination. One hundred years later, the Negro lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity. One hundred years later, the Negro is still languished in the corners of American society and finds himself an exile in his own land. And so we've come here today to dramatize a shameful condition. In a sense we've come to our nation's capital to cash a check. When the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence, they were signing a promissory note to which every American was to fall heir. This note was a promise that all men, yes, black men as well as white men, would be guaranteed the ""unalienable Rights"" of ""Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness."" It is obvious today that America has defaulted on this promissory note, insofar as her citizens of color are concerned. Instead of honoring this sacred obligation, America has given the Negro people a bad check, a check which has come back marked ""insufficient funds."" But we refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt. We refuse to believe that there are insufficient funds in the great vaults of opportunity of this nation. And so, we've come to cash this check, a check that will give us upon demand the riches of freedom and the security of justice. We have also come to this hallowed spot to remind America of the fierce urgency of Now. This is no time to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to take the tranquilizing drug of gradualism. Now is the time to make real the promises of democracy. Now is the time to rise from the dark and desolate valley of segregation to the sunlit path of racial justice. Now is the time to lift our nation from the quicksands of racial injustice to the solid rock of brotherhood. Now is the time to make justice a reality for all of God's children. It would be fatal for the nation to overlook the urgency of the moment. This sweltering summer of the Negro's legitimate discontent will not pass until there is an invigorating autumn of freedom and equality. Nineteen sixty-three is not an end, but a beginning. And those who hope that the Negro needed to blow off steam and will now be content will have a rude awakening if the nation returns to business as usual. And there will be neither rest nor tranquility in America until the Negro is granted his citizenship rights. The whirlwinds of revolt will continue to shake the foundations of our nation until the bright day of justice emerges. But there is something that I must say to my people, who stand on the warm threshold which leads into the palace of justice: In the process of gaining our rightful place, we must not be guilty of wrongful deeds. Let us not seek to satisfy our thirst for freedom by drinking from the cup of bitterness and hatred. We must forever conduct our struggle on the high plane of dignity and discipline. We must not allow our creative protest to degenerate into physical violence. Again and again, we must rise to the majestic heights of meeting physical force with soul force. The marvelous new militancy which has engulfed the Negro community must not lead us to a distrust of all white people, for many of our white brothers, as evidenced by their presence here today, have come to realize that their destiny is tied up with our destiny. And they have come to realize that their freedom is inextricably bound to our freedom. We cannot walk alone. And as we walk, we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead. We cannot turn back. There are those who are asking the devotees of civil rights, ""When will you be satisfied?"" We can never be satisfied as long as the Negro is the victim of the unspeakable horrors of police brutality. We can never be satisfied as long as our bodies, heavy with the fatigue of travel, cannot gain lodging in the motels of the highways and the hotels of the cities. We cannot be satisfied as long as the negro's basic mobility is from a smaller ghetto to a larger one. We can never be satisfied as long as our children are stripped of their self-hood and robbed of their dignity by signs stating: ""For Whites Only."" We cannot be satisfied as long as a Negro in Mississippi cannot vote and a Negro in New York believes he has nothing for which to vote. No, no, we are not satisfied, and we will not be satisfied until ""justice rolls down like waters, and righteousness like a mighty stream."" I am not unmindful that some of you have come here out of great trials and tribulations. Some of you have come fresh from narrow jail cells. And some of you have come from areas where your quest -- quest for freedom left you battered by the storms of persecution and staggered by the winds of police brutality. You have been the veterans of creative suffering. Continue to work with the faith that unearned suffering is redemptive. Go back to Mississippi, go back to Alabama, go back to South Carolina, go back to Georgia, go back to Louisiana, go back to the slums and ghettos of our northern cities, knowing that somehow this situation can and will be changed. Let us not wallow in the valley of despair, I say to you today, my friends. And so even though we face the difficulties of today and tomorrow, I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream. I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: ""We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal."" I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia, the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood. I have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of injustice, sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice. I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character. I have a dream today! I have a dream that one day, down in Alabama, with its vicious racists, with its governor having his lips dripping with the words of ""interposition"" and ""nullification"" -- one day right there in Alabama little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers. I have a dream today! I have a dream that one day every valley shall be exalted, and every hill and mountain shall be made low, the rough places will be made plain, and the crooked places will be made straight; ""and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed and all flesh shall see it together."" This is our hope, and this is the faith that I go back to the South with. With this faith, we will be able to hew out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope. With this faith, we will be able to transform the jangling discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood. With this faith, we will be able to work together, to pray together, to struggle together, to go to jail together, to stand up for freedom together, knowing that we will be free one day. And this will be the day -- this will be the day when all of God's children will be able to sing with new meaning: My country 'tis of thee, sweet land of liberty, of thee I sing. Land where my fathers died, land of the Pilgrim's pride, From every mountainside, let freedom ring! And if America is to be a great nation, this must become true. And so let freedom ring from the prodigious hilltops of New Hampshire. Let freedom ring from the mighty mountains of New York. Let freedom ring from the heightening Alleghenies of Pennsylvania. Let freedom ring from the snow-capped Rockies of Colorado. Let freedom ring from the curvaceous slopes of California. But not only that: Let freedom ring from Stone Mountain of Georgia. Let freedom ring from Lookout Mountain of Tennessee. Let freedom ring from every hill and molehill of Mississippi. From every mountainside, let freedom ring. And when this happens, and when we allow freedom ring, when we let it ring from every village and every hamlet, from every state and every city, we will be able to speed up that day when all of God's children, black men and white men, Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics, will be able to join hands and sing in the words of the old Negro spiritual: Free at last! Free at last! Thank God Almighty, we are free at last!",0.0

The rally that began with a peaceful protest at the Portland police station devolved as the night went on, with police pushing back protesters on Franklin Street as some shoved and threw bottles at them. Police arrested 23 people overnight as burglaries and criminal mischief occurred at several businesses in the downtown areas, according to a spokesperson. “Our goal remains providing a safe environment for those wishing to peacefully express their views and First Amendment rights,” Police Chief Frank Clark said in a statement. The escalations began after a tractor-trailer drove through the group that was gathered outside the police station at 9:30 p.m. Nobody was injured, but some protesters confronted the driver of the tractor trailer, Anthony McAfee of Massachusetts, and his passenger. Police took McAfee into custody and he was later arrested on a felony charge of reckless conduct. All others who were arrested face a misdemeanor charge of failing to disperse. They were all from the Portland area and were between the ages of 19 and 42. Following that event, protesters “were encircling and attempting to damage the police vehicles that had been positioned at intersections and “several officers had water bottles, glass bottles and rocks thrown at them,” according to an account by the police department released on Tuesday. Many protesters appeared to arrive at the event around that time. One organizer, a black woman, yelled at those who threw water bottles in the direction of police, accusing them of escalating the protest beyond the wishes of organizers. “Your white privilege is showing!” she shouted. Burglaries were recorded at four locations in connection with the protest, including Urban Outfitters, which was broken into by a large group, according to the report. Officers also recorded graffiti in more than a dozen areas and “several trash cans” set on fire in the Old Port. More than 150 police officers, including state and county police and departments spanning 13 municipalities, convened at the intersection between 10 p.m. and 2 a.m., when the group dispersed. Police used pepper spray several times, though a Bangor Daily News reporter witnessed an officer fire a projectile that appeared to be a rubber bullet in the direction of a protester that was unaccounted for in the department’s official account. “We are fortunate that no one was seriously injured and that most of the property damage was minimal,” Clark said.",0.0

Trump and First Lady Melania Trump traveled across town Tuesday for a brief visit to Saint John Paul II National Shrine adjacent to The Catholic University of America. The shrine is a place of prayer for Catholics but welcomes people of all faiths. The Trumps posed for photos in front of a statue of Saint Pope John Paul II outside the shrine and stood silently for a few minutes, hands clasped in front of them. They did not make remarks. Washington Archbishop Wilton D. Gregory slammed the presidential visit in a statement shortly before the Trumps' arrival. “I find it baffling that and reprehensible that any Catholic facility would allow itself to be so egregiously misused and manipulated in a fashion that violates our religious principles, which call us to defend the rights of all people even those with whom we might disagree,” Gregory said in a statement. Trump also is scheduled to sign an executive order on international religious freedom on Tuesday. Trump's visit to the shrine comes just one day after he walked across Lafayette Park next to the White House and posed for cameras outside St. John's Episcopal Church, which suffered slight damage after it was set on fire by protesters late Sunday night. Violent protests have erupted in Washington and dozens of other cities across the country following the death of George Floyd, a black man in Minneapolis who died in the custody of police. Former police officer Derrick Chauvin has been charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter in Floyd's death. Critics hammered Trump because police used tear gas and shields on protesters in Lafayette Park, essentially clearing a path for the president to walk to the historic building known as the church of presidents. The show of force came roughly half an hour before a 7 p.m. curfew was to take effect in Washington. ""Tear-gassing peaceful protesters without provocation just so that the President could pose for photos outside a church dishonors every value that faith teaches us,"" said a joint statement from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, said in a speech Tuesday in Philadelphia that the St. John's event proves Trump is ""more interested in serving the passions of his base."" ""When peaceful protesters are dispersed by the order of the president from the doorstep of the people’s house, the White House – using tear gas and flash grenades – in order to stage a photo op at a noble church, we can be forgiven for believing that the president is more interested in power than in principle,"" Biden said. Church officials protested that Trump did not call them about his plans to visit to St. John's on Monday. Mariann E. Budde, bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Washington, which includes St. John’s Episcopal Church, told CNN she was outraged by the use of tear gas to get people out of the way for a photo op. ""The president just used a Bible, the most sacred text of the Judeo-Christian tradition, and one of the churches of my diocese, without permission, as a backdrop for a message antithetical to the teachings of Jesus and everything that our churches stand for,"" she said. Bishop Gregory noted that Saint Pope John Paul II was “an ardent defender of the rights and dignity of human beings"" and ""certainly would not condone the use of tear gas and other deterrents to silence, scatter or intimidate them for a photo opportunity in front of a place of worship and peace."" White House officials said Trump did want to pay his respects to St. John's, which suffered a basement fire during protests Sunday. The president also wanted to leave the White House grounds to prove he was not “in the bunker“ because of the protesters, said one official who requested anonymity to discuss the president’s communications strategy. The president was particularly angry when word got out that the Secret Service escorted him to the bunker of the White House during protests just beyond the gates of the executive mansion on Friday, the official said. After the St. John's visit, the White House put out a statement saying protesters had been repeatedly warned to exit the park ahead of the 7 p.m. curfew. “The perimeter was expanded to help enforce the 7 p.m.curfew in the same area where rioters attempted to burn down one of our nation’s most historic churches the night before,"" spokesman Judd Deere. ""Protesters were given three warnings by the U.S. Park Police."" In a morning tweet less than two hours before his visit to the shrine,Trump took credit for crackdowns in Washington – and Minneapolis. ""D.C. had no problems last night,"" he said. ""Many arrests. Great job done by all. Overwhelming force. Domination. Likewise, Minneapolis was great (thank you President Trump!)."" A couple hundred peaceful protesters gathered down the street from the national shrine ahead of Trump’s arrival, holding up signs and chanting ""no justice, no peace"" and ""black lives matter."" Police on the scene wore baseball caps and vests, but not riot gear. As Trump's motorcade arrived, some protesters shouted expletives, and others raised their middle finger. Kathy Warner, a 77-year-old retired teacher, said she was there to honor Floyd’s memory and to protest the president. She held a sign that read ""in solidarity – RIP George Floyd – Black Lives Matter.” Warner said she hoped passing drivers would read the message and “think about the injustice done to African Americans for centuries.” Warner said she has a 49-year-old son and that her heart “hurts for moms whose sons can’t reach that age.” She called Trump’s visit to St. John’s on Monday “obscene” for the way he “poses with the Bible.” Some drivers honked in support as they passed by and shook their fists out their car windows. The shrine to the late Pope John Paul II sits on the site of the former John Paul II Cultural Center, which the Knights of Columbus bought in 2011. The lay Catholic organization established it as a shrine to John Paul and added a permanent museum exhibit about his life. Daily masses are held at the shrine, which is a destination for Catholic pilgrims. The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops declared it a national shrine on March 14, 2014, after John Paul was canonized as a saint. ""It is meant to be a place of genuine encounter with God that leads to a renewal of individuals, families, societies, and cultures,"" reads the shrine's official website, adding it is a place where God ""heals and renews every dimension of human life.""

PARIS — Thousands of French protesters defied a virus-related police ban and rallied Tuesday against racial injustice and heavy-handed police tactics, as global outrage over what happened to George Floyd in the United States kindled frustrations across borders and continents. Clapping, cheering and waving signs reading ""Black Lives Matter"" and ""Police Everywhere, Justice Nowhere,"" the largely young, multiracial crowd streamed to the main Paris courthouse and rallied peacefully while police monitored closely from nearby corners. Earlier, thousands marched in Sydney, Australia's largest city, chanting ""I can't breathe,"" and expressions of anger erupted in multiple languages on social networks, with thousands of Swedes joining an online protest and others speaking out under the banner of #BlackOutTuesday. Diplomatic ire percolated too, with the European Union's top foreign policy official saying the bloc was ""shocked and appalled"" by Floyd's death. As protests escalated worldwide, solidarity with U.S. demonstrators increasingly mixed with local worries. ""When you refuse to treat the problem of racism ... it leads to what we see in the United States,"" said Dominique Sopo, head of French activist group SOS Racisme. ""The case of George Floyd echoes what we fear in France."" Floyd died last week after a police officer pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes even after he stopped moving and pleading for air. The death set off protests that spread across America -- and now, beyond. Fears of the coronavirus remain close to the surface and were the reason cited by the police for banning Tuesday's protest at the main Paris courthouse. Gatherings of more than 10 people remain banned in France as part of virus confinement measures. But the Paris protest plans drew attention online, and demonstrators showed up anyway. Similar demonstrations were held in other French cities in honor of Adama Traore, who died shortly after his arrest in 2016, and in solidarity with Americans demonstrating against Floyd's death. The Traore case has become emblematic of the fight against police brutality in France. The circumstances of the death of the 24-year-old Frenchman of Malian origin are still under investigation after four years of conflicting medical reports about what happened. The lawyer for two of the three police officers involved in the arrest, Rodolphe Bosselut, said the Floyd and Traore cases ""have strictly nothing to do with each other."" Bosselut told The Associated Press that Traore's death wasn't linked with the conditions of his arrest but other factors, including a pre-existing medical condition. Traore's family says he died from asphyxiation because of police tactics -- and that his last words were ""I can't breathe."" ""I can't breathe"" were also the final words of David Dungay, a 26-year-old Aboriginal man who died in a Sydney prison in 2015 while being restrained by five guards. As 3,000 people marched peacefully through Sydney, many said they had been inspired by a mixture of sympathy for African Americans amid ongoing violent protests in the U.S. and to call for change in Australia's treatment of its indigenous population, particularly involving police. The mostly Australian crowd at the authorized demonstration also included protesters from the U.S. and elsewhere. ""I'm here for my people, and for our fallen brothers and sisters around the world,"" said Sydney indigenous woman Amanda Hill, 46, who attended the rally with her daughter and two nieces. ""What's happening in America shines a light on the situation here. It doesn't matter if it's about the treatment of black men and women from here or from another country; enough is enough,"" she said. A total of 432 indigenous Australians have died in police detention since a 1991 Royal Commission — Australia's highest level of official inquiry — into Aboriginal deaths in custody, according to The Guardian newspaper. Australia has also never signed a treaty with the country's indigenous population, who suffer higher-than-average rates of infant mortality and poor health, plus shorter life expectancy and lower levels of education and employment than white Australians. Another protest was planned Tuesday in the Dutch capital The Hague, and more than 6,000 people attended a Sweden-organized online protest to express support with the Black Lives Matter movement. Among speakers was Aysha Jones, a Gambia-born and Sweden-based activist and fashion blogger. Jones said the protest was important to show support to people in America, but also to remind Swedes that racism ""does exist here, it's very real and people are being harmed from it."" More protests in various countries are planned later in the week, including a string of demonstrations in front of U.S. embassies on Saturday. The drama unfolding in the U.S. drew increasing diplomatic concern. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell's remarks in Brussels were the strongest to come out of the 27-nation bloc, saying Floyd's death was a result of an abuse of power. Borrell told reporters that ""like the people of the United States, we are shocked and appalled by the death of George Floyd."" He underlined that Europeans ""support the right to peaceful protest, and also we condemn violence and racism of any kind, and for sure, we call for a de-escalation of tensions."" German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said peaceful protests in the U.S. following Floyd's death are ""understandable and more than legitimate."" ""I can only express my hope that the peaceful protests do not continue to lead to violence, but even more express the hope that these protests have an effect in the United States,"" Maas said. More African leaders are speaking up over the killing of Floyd. ""It cannot be right that, in the 21st century, the United States, this great bastion of democracy, continues to grapple with the problem of systemic racism,"" Ghana President Nana Akufo-Addo said in a statement, adding that black people the world over are shocked and distraught. Kenyan opposition leader and former Prime Minister Raila Odinga offered a prayer for the U.S., ""that there be justice and freedom for all human beings who call America their country."" Like some in Africa who have spoken out, Odinga also noted troubles at home, saying the judging of people by character instead of skin color ""is a dream we in Africa, too, owe our citizens.""",0.0

Leading the event were Palana Belken, Rochester City Councilor, and Emmett Soldati, owner of Teatotaller cafe in Somersworth and candidate for the New Hampshire Executive Council District 2 seat. The event was attended by Pride event organizers across the state, GLSEN, Stonewall Democrats, several drag performers and elected leaders, among others, according to organizers. The agenda began with a moment of silence for social justice and Black Lives Matter and proceeded to a “Pride Roll Call” - an opportunity for leaders of Pride organizations to each talk about how they are planning to celebrate Pride amid the coronavirus pandemic. Palana said, “The biggest takeaway from this call was that people were talking about the need for statewide activation beyond what each community is doing.” Soldait said, “In Massachusetts and Maine for example, there are statewide Pride organizations but unfortunately that does not exist in New Hampshire. The silver lining here is that because of COVID and the fact that we are meeting in a Pride Town Hall on Zoom, we are connecting with people from Claremont and Conway and elsewhere who we might not have met in our own bubble. As a result, we can see the goal of using Pride Town Hall and this technology to build the infrastructure for statewide planning.” Soldait announced the launch of his LGBTQ+ Coalition to advise his campaign and amplify LGBTQ+ concerns. More than 25 leaders, activists and performers from across the state have thus far announced their participation in the coalition, which will be chaired by Belken. Belken explained the idea behind the unique Town Hall. “As we discussed the topic of how will each of us observe Pride Month this year, we reflected on how LGBTQ Pride celebrations have come a long way, from their origins as a riot against anti-LGBTQ ordinances and police abuse at the Stonewall Inn, to a worldwide celebration of the progress made in the 51 years since,” Belken said. “There were six Pride festivals scheduled to take place across New Hampshire this month - but with large gatherings on hold for the time being, we felt it urgent to gather folks from across the state to hold space together and share how we'll each be rising to the occasion for Pride 2020.”",0.0

The Public Health England report hinted at reasons for the discrepancy but didn’t offer any recommendations. The government didn’t offer any solutions, prompting concerns that people from black, Asian and other minority backgrounds will still face a disproportionate risk if there is a second spike in the coronavirus outbreak. Dr. Kailash Chand, a former deputy chair at the British Medical Association, said the report could be viewed as a “whitewash” for failing to deliver recommendations. “This was something to show that they were appearing to do something,” he said. The study, commissioned by the government in April at the height of the U.K. outbreak, found that people of Bangladeshi ethnicity had about twice the risk of death from the virus as white Britons. It said people of Chinese, Indian, Pakistani, other Asian, Caribbean and other black backgrounds also had a higher risk of death than white Britons – of between 10% and 50%. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said it was inarguable that “being black or from a minority ethnic background is a major risk factor” in the pandemic. “This is a particularly timely publication because right across the world people are angry about racial injustice,” Hancock said at a news conference, referring to unrest in the United States over the death of unarmed black man George Floyd while he was being detained by police. “I get that,” Hancock said of people’s anger. “Black lives matter.” Hancock said the government would investigate the issues involved in the coming weeks and months. “I totally understand the urgency, the importance and the sensitivity of getting this right,” he said. The main opposition Labour Party said the government must act now to protect ethnic-minority groups. It said the review, which drew on official statistics and other data, largely confirmed what was already known about racial and health inequalities. “When it comes to the question of how we reduce these disparities, it is notably silent,” said Marsha de Cordova, Labour’s equalities spokeswoman. “The government must not wait any longer to mitigate the risks faced by these communities.” The study did not take account of factors such as obesity — which increases the risk of death from the coronavirus — or the occupations of those who have died. Those are major considerations. The study found that care workers, security guards and road transport drivers, all jobs in which ethnic minority workers are strongly represented, had significantly higher than average death rates. The report noted that an analysis of over 10,000 patients with COVID-19 admitted to intensive care in U.K. hospitals suggested that, “once age, sex, obesity and comorbidities are taken into account, there is no difference in the likelihood of being admitted to intensive care or of dying between ethnic groups.” Dr. Veena Raleigh, a senior fellow at health care think tank the King’s Fund, said the report highlighted “profound inequalities” but that there were still some “very big unanswered questions” about the virus’ impact on ethnic groups. “This is not a lightbulb moment,” the epidemiologist said. The study confirmed that the biggest risk factor with COVID-19 is age, with people aged 80 or over 70 times more likely to die from the virus than those aged under 40. It also found that working age men were twice as likely to die as working age women, and that people living in deprived areas were more likely to die than those in affluent areas. Rebecca Hilsenrath, Chief Executive of the Equality and Human Rights Commission, said the broader context of entrenched racial inequality across all areas of life needs to be addressed. “Only a comprehensive race equality strategy will address these issues,” she said. “Now is a once in a generation opportunity for government to deliver one.” ___ Follow AP coverage of the pandemic at https://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak Send questions/comments to the editors. « Previous Next » filed under:",0.0

Other symbols came down elsewhere, leaving an empty pedestal and a bare flagpole. Workers hired by the city of Birmingham began removing the top portion of the 115-year-old monument from Linn Park late Monday. By daybreak, the pedestal was the only thing left, covered with graffiti and pock marks from protests against police brutality. Sarah Collins Rudolph, whose sister Addie Mae Collins died in a racist church bombing that killed three other black girls in the city in 1963, came to see the remains. She lowered a protective face mask to take in the sight. “I’m glad it’s been removed because it has been so long. It’s a hate monument,” said Rudolph. She was seriously injured in the blast at 16th Street Baptist Church, and testified against Ku Klux Klansmen who were convicted in the killings. Confederate symbols across the South have been targeted for vandalism during demonstrations sparked by the death in police custody of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Now even some of their longtime defenders have decided to remove them. In Alexandria, Virginia, it was the United Daughters of the Confederacy that took action early Tuesday, removing the statue of a soldier gazing south from Old Town since 1889. And outside Tampa, Florida, a Sons of Confederate Veterans chapter lowered a huge Confederate battle flag that has long been flown in view of two interstate highways. Birmingham finally took action about a day after protesters tried to remove the monument themselves, during one of the many nationwide protests. Live video from overnight showed a flatbed truck hauling off the stone pieces in the early morning hours. It’s unclear where they were being taken. Crews were expected to return later Tuesday to finish the job, a city official said. The monument had been the subject of a protracted court battle between the city and state. Alabama authorities said Birmingham would face a $25,000 assessment for violating a state law that bans the removal of such monuments. Mayor Randall Woodfin said the fine would be much more affordable than the cost of continued unrest in the city. Work to remove the monument began on Monday, which happened to be Alabama’s holiday honoring Confederate President Jefferson Davis, who was sworn in on the steps of the state Capitol in Montgomery. There, on the same day, someone knocked over a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee outside a mostly black high school named for him, news outlets reported. In Alexandria, a city spokesman said the United Daughters of the Confederacy informed the city on Monday that it would remove the statue, and the city’s only role was to provide traffic support. By morning, the pedestal was all that was left. City officials were not told where the statue was taken. Titled “Appomattox,” it depicts a solitary Confederate soldier, his head bowed slightly. In 1890, a state law was passed barring local officials from ever removing it. That law was repealed earlier this year.

1623534827,2020-06-02 14:24:27,U.S. cities erupt in more violence as Trump decries ‘lowlifes’,https://www.centralmaine.com/2020/06/02/u-s-cities-erupt-in-more-violence-as-trump-decries-lowlifes/,en,False,,29592,onlinesentinel.com,http://www.onlinesentinel.com#spider,"WASHINGTON — Undeterred by curfews, protesters streamed back into the nation’s streets Tuesday, hours after President Trump pressed governors to put down the violence set off by George Floyd’s death and demanded that New York call up the National Guard to stop the “lowlifes and losers.” As more demonstrations began taking shape around the country, and cities including Washington prepared for the possibility of more violence, the president amplified his hard-line calls of a day earlier, in which he threatened to send in the military to restore order if governors didn’t do it. “NYC, CALL UP THE NATIONAL GUARD,” he tweeted. “The lowlifes and losers are ripping you apart. Act fast!” One day after a crackdown on peaceful protesters near the White House, thousands of demonstrators massed a block away from the presidential mansion, facing law enforcement personnel standing behind a black chain-link fence. The fence was put up overnight to block access to Lafayette Park, just across the street from the White House. “Last night pushed me way over the edge,” said Jessica DeMaio, 40, of Washington, who attended a Floyd protest Tuesday for the first time. “Being here is better than being at home feeling helpless.” The crowd remained in place after the city’s 7 p.m. curfew passed, defying warnings that the response from law enforcement could be even more forceful. But the protest lacked the tension of the previous nights’ demonstrations. The crowd Tuesday was peaceful, polite even. At one point, the crowd booed when a protester climbed a light post and took down a street sign. A chant went up: “Peaceful protest!” On Monday, law enforcement officers on foot and horseback aggressively drove protesters away from Lafayette Park, clearing the way for President Trump to do a photo op at nearby St. John’s Church. On Tuesday, pastors at the church prayed with demonstrators and handed out water bottles. Protests ranged across the U.S., including in New York City, Los Angeles, Miami, Houston, St. Paul, Minnesota, Columbia, South Carolina, and Orlando, Florida, where more than 1,000 people gathered in the afternoon to decry the killings of black people. “This has to change,” said 39-year-old Aisxia Batiste, an out-of-work massage therapist in Orlando. “Something has to give. We’re done. This is the beginning of the end of something. It has to be.” In New York, midtown Manhattan was pocked with battered storefronts after Monday’s protests. Macy’s flagship store was among those hit when crowds of people smashed windows and looted stores as they swept through the area. A police sergeant was hospitalized after being hit by a car in the Bronx, where people walked Tuesday between ransacked buildings and a burned-out car on the Grand Concourse, a commercial thoroughfare. Police made nearly 700 arrests and Mayor Bill de Blasio extended an 8 p.m. curfew all week. “We’re going to have a tough few days,” he warned, but added: “We’re going to beat it back.” He pleaded with community leaders to step forward and “create peace.” More than 20,000 National Guard members have been called up in 29 states to deal with the violence. New York is not among them, and De Blasio has said he does not want the Guard. On Tuesday, Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo called what happened in the city “a disgrace.” “The NYPD and the mayor did not do their job last night,” Cuomo said at a briefing in Albany. He said the mayor underestimated the problem, and the nation’s largest police force was not deployed in sufficient numbers, though the city had said it doubled the usual police presence. Tuesday marked the eight straight night of the protests, which began in Minneapolis, where Floyd died, and quickly spread across the country. The mother of George Floyd’s 6-year-old daughter, Gianna, said she wanted the world to know that her little girl lost a good father. “I want everybody to know that this is what those officers took,” Roxie Washington said during a Minneapolis news conference with her young daughter at her side. “I want justice for him because he was good. No matter what anybody thinks, he was good.” On Monday, scattered violence flared in multiple protests, including an officer who was shot and gravely wounded outside a Las Vegas hotel and casino, and four officers shot in St. Louis. They were expected to recover. About a dozen other deaths have been reported around the country over the past week. And nearly 8,000 people nationwide have been arrested, according to a count by The Associated Press. Some protesters framed the burgeoning movement as a necessity after a string of killings by police. “It feels like it’s just been an endless cascade of hashtags of black people dying, and it feels like nothing’s really being done by our political leaders to actually enact real change,” said Christine Ohenzuwa, 19, who attended a peaceful protest at the Minnesota state Capitol in St. Paul. “There’s always going to be a breaking point. I think right now, we’re seeing the breaking point around the country.” “I live in this state. It’s really painful to see what’s going on, but it’s also really important to understand that it’s connected to a system of racial violence,” she said. Meanwhile, governors and mayors, Republicans and Democrats alike, rejected Trump’s threat to send in the military, with some saying troops would be unnecessary and others questioning whether the government has such authority and warning that such a step would be dangerous. “Denver is not Little Rock in 1957, and Donald Trump is not President Eisenhower. This is a time for healing, for bringing people together, and the best way to protect civil rights is to move away from escalating violence,” Colorado Gov. Jared Polis and Denver Mayor Michael Hancock, both Democrats, said in a statement, referring to Eisenhower’s use of troops to enforce school desegregation in the South. A senior White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that the president is not rushing to send in the military and that his goal was to pressure governors to deploy more National Guard members. Such use of the military would mark a stunning federal intervention rarely seen in modern American history. Amid the protests, nine states and the District of Columbia held presidential primaries. Joe Biden has been moving closer to formally clinching the Democratic presidential nomination. In Washington, voting stations stayed open until 8 p.m., an hour past the city’s curfew. Voting was deemed essential, and city officials said voters would not be subject to arrest. Philadelphia moved its 6 p.m. curfew back to 8:30 p.m. to accommodate voting. Minnesota, meanwhile, opened an investigation into whether the Minneapolis Police Department has a pattern of discrimination against minorities. Floyd died May 25 after a white Minneapolis officer, Derek Chauvin, pressed his knee on the handcuffed black man’s neck for several minutes. Chauvin has been charged with murder. Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said prosecutors are working as fast as they can to determine if the three other officers at the scene should be charged too. All four have been fired.

1623534825,2020-06-02 14:45:10,Trump threatens military force against protesters nationwide,https://www.centralmaine.com/2020/06/02/trump-threatens-military-force-against-protesters-nationwide/,en,False,,29592,onlinesentinel.com,http://www.onlinesentinel.com#spider,"WASHINGTON — Wielding extraordinary federal authority, President Donald Trump threatened the nation’s governors on Monday that he would deploy the military to states if they did not stamp out violent protests over police brutality that have roiled the nation over the past week. His announcement came as police under federal command forced back peaceful demonstrators with tear gas so he could walk to a nearby church and pose with a Bible. Trump’s bellicose rhetoric came as the nation convulsed through another round of violence over the death of George Floyd at a time when the country is already buckling under the coronavirus outbreak and the Depression-level unemployment it has caused. The president demanded an end to the heated protests in remarks from the White House Rose Garden and vowed to use more force to achieve that aim. If governors throughout the country do not deploy the National Guard in sufficient numbers to “dominate the streets,” Trump said the U.S. military would step in to “quickly solve the problem for them.” “We have the greatest country in the world,” the president declared. “We’re going to keep it safe.” A military deployment by Trump to U.S. states would mark a stunning federal intervention rarely seen in modern American history. Yet the message Trump appeared to be sending with the brazen pushback of protesters outside the White House was that he sees few limits to what he is willing to do. Some around the president likened the moment to 1968, when Richard Nixon ran as the law-and-order candidate in the aftermath of a summer of riots, capturing the White House. But despite his efforts to portray himself as a political outsider, Trump is an incumbent who risks being held responsible for the violence. Minutes before Trump began speaking, police and National Guard soldiers began aggressively forcing back hundreds of peaceful protesters who had gathered in Lafayette Park, across the street from the White House, where they were chanting against police brutality and Floyd’s death in Minneapolis. As Trump spoke, tear gas canisters could be heard exploding. Floyd died last week after he was pinned to the pavement by a police officer who put his knee on the handcuffed black man’s neck until he stopped breathing. His death set off protests that spread from Minneapolis across America. His brother Terrence pleaded with protesters on Monday to remain peaceful. Five months before Election Day, the president made clear that he would stake his reelection efforts on convincing voters that his strong-arm approach was warranted to quell the most intense civil unrest since the 1960s. He made little effort to address the grievances of black Americans and others outraged by Floyd’s death and the scourge of police brutality, undermining what his campaign had hoped would be increased appeal to African American voters. The scene in and around the White House on Monday night appeared to be carefully orchestrated. As the crowd of protesters grew, Attorney General William Barr arrived in Lafayette Park to look over at the demonstrations and the swarm of law enforcement. The sudden shift in tactics against the protesters was initially a mystery. Then, after finishing his Rose Garden remarks, Trump emerged from the White House gates and walked through the park to St. John’s Church, where an office had been set on fire the previous night. Trump, who rarely attends church, held up a Bible and gathered a group of advisers — all white — to pose for photos. The moment was quickly decried by Trump’s critics, with New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo saying the president “used the military to push out a peaceful protest so he could have a photo op at a church.” “It’s all just a reality TV show for this president,” he said on Twitter. “Shameful.” Federal law permits presidents to dispatch the military into states to suppress an insurrection or if a state is defying federal law, legal experts said. But Trump’s statements also set up an immediate conflict with officials in New York and other states who asserted that the president does not have the unilateral right to send in troops against the will of local governments. The country has been beset by angry demonstrations for the past week in some of the most widespread racial unrest in the U.S. since the 1960s. Spurred largely by Floyd’s death, protesters have taken to the streets to decry the killings of black people by police. Minneapolis Officer Derek Chauvin has been charged with murder, but protesters are demanding that three of his colleagues be prosecuted, too. All four were fired. While most of the demonstrations have been peaceful, others have descended into violence, leaving neighborhoods in shambles, stores ransacked, windows broken and cars burned, despite curfews around the country and the deployment of thousands of National Guard members in at least 15 states. On Monday, demonstrations erupted from Philadelphia, where hundreds of protesters spilled onto a highway in the heart of the city, to Atlanta, where police fired tear gas at demonstrators, to Nashville, where more than 60 National Guard soldiers put down their riot shields at the request of peaceful protesters who had gathered in front of Tennessee’s state Capitol to honor Floyd. Two people were killed during protests in the Chicago suburb of Cicero, authorities said, but provided no details. In Louisville, Kentucky, riot police firing tear gas scattered several hundred protesters from downtown, violently capping a day of mostly peaceful protests. A vehicle plowed through a group of law enforcement officers at a demonstration in Buffalo, New York, injuring at least two. Video from the scene showed the vehicle accelerating through an intersection shortly after officers apparently tackled a protester and handcuffed him. The officers were hospitalized in stable condition, authorities said. In New York City, where nightfall has brought widespread scenes of destruction, large crowds rallied peacefully in Times Square and Brooklyn during the day. Then, in early evening, looters rushed into a Nike store in Manhattan and protesters smashed storefront windows near Rockefeller Center. Video posted on social media showed some protesters arguing with people breaking windows, urging them to stop. The city has already endured immense commercial damage from the unrest. On Monday, rioters got through the doors of the city’s flagship Macy’s store, famous for its Thanksgiving Day parade, and police later pulled at least two handcuffed men out of the store and put them into a van. By that time, most of the street was littered with broken glass. In Washington, protesters continued marching peacefully through Washington hours after being forced from Lafayette park and past the 7 p.m. curfew. Eventually, within sight of the Capitol building, the marchers were turned back by law enforcement officers using tear gas, pellets and low-flying helicopters kicking up debris. As they dispersed, some protesters smashed windows at a nearby office building. Earlier Monday, Trump told the nation’s governors in a video conference that they “look like fools” for not deploying even more National Guard troops. “Most of you are weak,” he said. He added: “You’ve got to arrest people, you have to track people, you have to put them in jail for 10 years and you’ll never see this stuff again.” Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, a Democrat, dismissed Trump’s comments as the “rantings of an insecure man trying to look strong after building his entire political career on racism.” Former Vice President Joe Biden, the Democratic presidential candidate, vowed to address institutional racism in his first 100 days in office. He met in person with black leaders in Delaware and also held a virtual meeting with big-city mayors. Biden said hate emerges “when you have somebody in power who breathes oxygen into the hate.” In Minneapolis, meanwhile, Floyd’s brother Terrence made an emotional plea for peace at the site where Floyd was arrested. “Let’s switch it up, y’all. Let’s switch it up. Do this peacefully, please,” Terrence Floyd said as he urged people to use their power at the ballot box. Also Monday, an autopsy commissioned for Floyd’s family found that he died of asphyxiation from neck and back compression, the family’s attorneys said. Authorities in many cities have blamed the violence on outside agitators, though have provided little evidence to back that up. But on Monday, federal authorities arrested a 28-year-old Illinois man saying he had posted a self-recorded video on his Facebook page last week that showed him in Minneapolis handing out explosive devices and encouraging people to throw them at law enforcement officers. More than 5,600 people nationwide have been arrested over the past week for such offenses as stealing, blocking highways and breaking curfew, according to a count by The Associated Press. Sullivan and Morrison reported from Minneapolis. Associated Press journalists across the U.S. contributed to this report.__ Send questions/comments to the editors. « Previous Next »",0.0
1623535907,2020-06-02 14:19:03,UK study finds minorities at higher risk of COVID-19 death,https://www.centralmaine.com/2020/06/02/uk-study-finds-minorities-at-higher-risk-of-covid-19-death/,en,False,,25755,Central Maine News,https://www.centralmaine.com/,"LONDON — People from ethnic minorities have died from COVID-19 in larger relative numbers in England than their white compatriots, according to a study published by health authorities Tuesday. The Public Health England report hinted at reasons for the discrepancy but didn’t offer any recommendations. The government didn’t offer any solutions, prompting concerns that people from black, Asian and other minority backgrounds will still face a disproportionate risk if there is a second spike in the coronavirus outbreak. Dr. Kailash Chand, a former deputy chair at the British Medical Association, said the report could be viewed as a “whitewash” for failing to deliver recommendations. “This was something to show that they were appearing to do something,” he said. The study, commissioned by the government in April at the height of the U.K. outbreak, found that people of Bangladeshi ethnicity had about twice the risk of death from the virus as white Britons. It said people of Chinese, Indian, Pakistani, other Asian, Caribbean and other black backgrounds also had a higher risk of death than white Britons – of between 10% and 50%. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said it was inarguable that “being black or from a minority ethnic background is a major risk factor” in the pandemic. “This is a particularly timely publication because right across the world people are angry about racial injustice,” Hancock said at a news conference, referring to unrest in the United States over the death of unarmed black man George Floyd while he was being detained by police. “I get that,” Hancock said of people’s anger. “Black lives matter.” Hancock said the government would investigate the issues involved in the coming weeks and months. “I totally understand the urgency, the importance and the sensitivity of getting this right,” he said. The main opposition Labour Party said the government must act now to protect ethnic-minority groups. It said the review, which drew on official statistics and other data, largely confirmed what was already known about racial and health inequalities. “When it comes to the question of how we reduce these disparities, it is notably silent,” said Marsha de Cordova, Labour’s equalities spokeswoman. “The government must not wait any longer to mitigate the risks faced by these communities.” The study did not take account of factors such as obesity — which increases the risk of death from the coronavirus — or the occupations of those who have died. Those are major considerations. The study found that care workers, security guards and road transport drivers, all jobs in which ethnic minority workers are strongly represented, had significantly higher than average death rates. The report noted that an analysis of over 10,000 patients with COVID-19 admitted to intensive care in U.K. hospitals suggested that, “once age, sex, obesity and comorbidities are taken into account, there is no difference in the likelihood of being admitted to intensive care or of dying between ethnic groups.” Dr. Veena Raleigh, a senior fellow at health care think tank the King’s Fund, said the report highlighted “profound inequalities” but that there were still some “very big unanswered questions” about the virus’ impact on ethnic groups. “This is not a lightbulb moment,” the epidemiologist said. The study confirmed that the biggest risk factor with COVID-19 is age, with people aged 80 or over 70 times more likely to die from the virus than those aged under 40. It also found that working age men were twice as likely to die as working age women, and that people living in deprived areas were more likely to die than those in affluent areas. Rebecca Hilsenrath, Chief Executive of the Equality and Human Rights Commission, said the broader context of entrenched racial inequality across all areas of life needs to be addressed. “Only a comprehensive race equality strategy will address these issues,” she said. “Now is a once in a generation opportunity for government to deliver one.” ___ Follow AP coverage of the pandemic at https://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak Send questions/comments to the editors. « Previous Next » filed under:",0.0
1623535905,2020-06-02 14:24:27,U.S. cities erupt in more violence as Trump decries ‘lowlifes’,https://www.centralmaine.com/2020/06/02/u-s-cities-erupt-in-more-violence-as-trump-decries-lowlifes/,en,False,,25755,Central Maine News,https://www.centralmaine.com/,"WASHINGTON — Undeterred by curfews, protesters streamed back into the nation’s streets Tuesday, hours after President Trump pressed governors to put down the violence set off by George Floyd’s death and demanded that New York call up the National Guard to stop the “lowlifes and losers.” As more demonstrations began taking shape around the country, and cities including Washington prepared for the possibility of more violence, the president amplified his hard-line calls of a day earlier, in which he threatened to send in the military to restore order if governors didn’t do it. “NYC, CALL UP THE NATIONAL GUARD,” he tweeted. “The lowlifes and losers are ripping you apart. Act fast!” One day after a crackdown on peaceful protesters near the White House, thousands of demonstrators massed a block away from the presidential mansion, facing law enforcement personnel standing behind a black chain-link fence. The fence was put up overnight to block access to Lafayette Park, just across the street from the White House. “Last night pushed me way over the edge,” said Jessica DeMaio, 40, of Washington, who attended a Floyd protest Tuesday for the first time. “Being here is better than being at home feeling helpless.” The crowd remained in place after the city’s 7 p.m. curfew passed, defying warnings that the response from law enforcement could be even more forceful. But the protest lacked the tension of the previous nights’ demonstrations. The crowd Tuesday was peaceful, polite even. At one point, the crowd booed when a protester climbed a light post and took down a street sign. A chant went up: “Peaceful protest!” On Monday, law enforcement officers on foot and horseback aggressively drove protesters away from Lafayette Park, clearing the way for President Trump to do a photo op at nearby St. John’s Church. On Tuesday, pastors at the church prayed with demonstrators and handed out water bottles. Protests ranged across the U.S., including in New York City, Los Angeles, Miami, Houston, St. Paul, Minnesota, Columbia, South Carolina, and Orlando, Florida, where more than 1,000 people gathered in the afternoon to decry the killings of black people. “This has to change,” said 39-year-old Aisxia Batiste, an out-of-work massage therapist in Orlando. “Something has to give. We’re done. This is the beginning of the end of something. It has to be.” In New York, midtown Manhattan was pocked with battered storefronts after Monday’s protests. Macy’s flagship store was among those hit when crowds of people smashed windows and looted stores as they swept through the area. A police sergeant was hospitalized after being hit by a car in the Bronx, where people walked Tuesday between ransacked buildings and a burned-out car on the Grand Concourse, a commercial thoroughfare. Police made nearly 700 arrests and Mayor Bill de Blasio extended an 8 p.m. curfew all week. “We’re going to have a tough few days,” he warned, but added: “We’re going to beat it back.” He pleaded with community leaders to step forward and “create peace.” More than 20,000 National Guard members have been called up in 29 states to deal with the violence. New York is not among them, and De Blasio has said he does not want the Guard. On Tuesday, Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo called what happened in the city “a disgrace.” “The NYPD and the mayor did not do their job last night,” Cuomo said at a briefing in Albany. He said the mayor underestimated the problem, and the nation’s largest police force was not deployed in sufficient numbers, though the city had said it doubled the usual police presence. Tuesday marked the eight straight night of the protests, which began in Minneapolis, where Floyd died, and quickly spread across the country. The mother of George Floyd’s 6-year-old daughter, Gianna, said she wanted the world to know that her little girl lost a good father. “I want everybody to know that this is what those officers took,” Roxie Washington said during a Minneapolis news conference with her young daughter at her side. “I want justice for him because he was good.

Police made nearly 700 arrests and Mayor Bill de Blasio extended an 8 p.m. curfew all week. “We’re going to have a tough few days,” he warned, but added: “We’re going to beat it back.” He pleaded with community leaders to step forward and “create peace.” More than 20,000 National Guard members have been called up in 29 states to deal with the violence. New York is not among them, and De Blasio has said he does not want the Guard. On Tuesday, Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo called what happened in the city “a disgrace.” “The NYPD and the mayor did not do their job last night,” Cuomo said at a briefing in Albany. He said the mayor underestimated the problem, and the nation’s largest police force was not deployed in sufficient numbers, though the city had said it doubled the usual police presence. Tuesday marked the eight straight night of the protests, which began in Minneapolis, where Floyd died, and quickly spread across the country. The mother of George Floyd’s 6-year-old daughter, Gianna, said she wanted the world to know that her little girl lost a good father. “I want everybody to know that this is what those officers took,” Roxie Washington said during a Minneapolis news conference with her young daughter at her side. “I want justice for him because he was good. No matter what anybody thinks, he was good.” On Monday, scattered violence flared in multiple protests, including an officer who was shot and gravely wounded outside a Las Vegas hotel and casino, and four officers shot in St. Louis. They were expected to recover. About a dozen other deaths have been reported around the country over the past week. And nearly 8,000 people nationwide have been arrested, according to a count by The Associated Press. Some protesters framed the burgeoning movement as a necessity after a string of killings by police. “It feels like it’s just been an endless cascade of hashtags of black people dying, and it feels like nothing’s really being done by our political leaders to actually enact real change,” said Christine Ohenzuwa, 19, who attended a peaceful protest at the Minnesota state Capitol in St. Paul. “There’s always going to be a breaking point. I think right now, we’re seeing the breaking point around the country.” “I live in this state. It’s really painful to see what’s going on, but it’s also really important to understand that it’s connected to a system of racial violence,” she said. Meanwhile, governors and mayors, Republicans and Democrats alike, rejected Trump’s threat to send in the military, with some saying troops would be unnecessary and others questioning whether the government has such authority and warning that such a step would be dangerous. “Denver is not Little Rock in 1957, and Donald Trump is not President Eisenhower. This is a time for healing, for bringing people together, and the best way to protect civil rights is to move away from escalating violence,” Colorado Gov. Jared Polis and Denver Mayor Michael Hancock, both Democrats, said in a statement, referring to Eisenhower’s use of troops to enforce school desegregation in the South. A senior White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that the president is not rushing to send in the military and that his goal was to pressure governors to deploy more National Guard members. Such use of the military would mark a stunning federal intervention rarely seen in modern American history. Amid the protests, nine states and the District of Columbia held presidential primaries. Joe Biden has been moving closer to formally clinching the Democratic presidential nomination. In Washington, voting stations stayed open until 8 p.m., an hour past the city’s curfew. Voting was deemed essential, and city officials said voters would not be subject to arrest. Philadelphia moved its 6 p.m. curfew back to 8:30 p.m. to accommodate voting. Minnesota, meanwhile, opened an investigation into whether the Minneapolis Police Department has a pattern of discrimination against minorities. Floyd died May 25 after a white Minneapolis officer, Derek Chauvin, pressed his knee on the handcuffed black man’s neck for several minutes. Chauvin has been charged with murder. Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said prosecutors are working as fast as they can to determine if the three other officers at the scene should be charged too. All four have been fired.

Click here for all coronavirus stories. You can join others committed to safeguarding this vital public service by purchasing a subscription or donating directly to the newsroom. George Floyd died after a police officer pressed his knee on his neck until he stopped breathing, and riots have now erupted in cities across our nation. We can blame those police officers who participated in Floyd’s murder, and we can blame those looters who have moved well beyond peaceful demonstrations. But real solutions to these problems require that we probe deeper as we try to understand why our fragile sense of community has been shattered. We are hearing a cry for help due to widespread economic and racial inequalities. The riots and disproportionate COVID-19 suffering and death to African Americans and Latinos are intertwined. We have failed to deal with structural deficiencies that contribute to vulnerabilities, such as the quiet and relentless poisoning effects of poverty, fear of poverty and racism. And yet, it is now more evident that we are all at risk from the COVID-19 pandemic and nationwide riots as long as the most at-risk and vulnerable among us lack money, food, health care and shelter. We know that high levels of economic inequality are as toxic as the chemicals from Rachel Carson’s “Silent Spring.” Stripped and ravaged by environmental and economic insults, it should not be surprising that so many under-resourced poor people have succumbed to COVID-19. It should not be surprising that so many are angry at these health disparities and mistreatment by our society. Both the riots that erupted over the weekend as well as the racial disparity in the COVID-19 pandemic are profound wake-up calls for our society to address many of the structural barriers that impede a host of economic and health outcomes. Social distancing, wearing masks, COVID-19 testing and contact tracing are all critical public health strategies that will ultimately bring the coronavirus crisis under control. However, this pandemic provides our nation with an opportunity to rethink our social contract with each other, and assess our underlying sense of community and concern for our neighbors. At the deepest and most profound level, real structural change is needed, and we can see hints of how this might occur by the awe-inspiring work of hundreds of nonprofits and community-based organizations throughout our nation that are dealing with these types of structural deficiencies among those who are most vulnerable. The insight from the COVID-19 crisis and the current riots is that we are all interconnected and thus, our health depends on each other. But the full test of our commitment to a sense of community and fairness depends on our ability to provide adequate health care and basic rights to our most vulnerable citizens. By doing that, we will enrich our society and provide a firmer basis of safety for all. Leonard A.

Peaceful protesters in the park next to the White House were cleared with tear gas so the president of the United States of America could take a picture. Four police officers in St. Louis were shot as protests turned violent. While protests have largely been peaceful in Maine, tensions did escalate in Portland Monday night with police pushing back protestors and using pepper spray when some got close to their line and threw water bottles. Twenty-three arrests were made and multiple businesses were damaged, according to the city. Just as America cannot continue to look away from the systematic oppression that has existed for generations, we cannot look past these troubling developments. We also must not let chaos and fear drown out the voices of compassion, frustration, pain, reconciliation, and meaningful action. If there was a bright spot on Monday, it was the strength of those voices here in Maine. In Rockland, police chief Chris Young and Knox County Sheriff Tim Carroll joined with protesters to kneel silently for nine minutes, roughly the same amount of time that former Minneaoplis police officer Derek Chauvin, now charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter, had his knee on George Floyd’s neck. Floyd, an unarmed black man, died a short time later. “As law enforcement, we strive to hold ourselves to a higher standard. We must begin by coming forward and condemning unjust police violence. If we remain silent in the face of injustice, we fail to protect and serve,” Young said in a statement on his department’s Facebook page. “What happened to George Floyd is despicable — it should have never happened, and should never happen again. We don’t believe in letting evil flourish. We stand with you.” Melissa Barez, a Rockland resident of nearly 30 years, said she had never been more proud of her town. And she made an important appeal to togetherness. “I don’t want this to turn into an us versus them. There is no us versus them. It is all of us,” Barez told the crowd. “I love you all. I am proud of you all. I am thankful for you all.” In Bangor, police chief Mark Hathaway and Greater Bangor Area Branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People president Michael Alpert released a joint letter ahead of Monday’s downtown protest. “While the shocking actions of these police officers do not reflect the actions of all police offi­cers nationwide, their actions erode the trust and confidence that all neighborhoods must place in their police departments,” the letter said. “We know that the Bangor Police Department must build, improve, and sustain community trust through greater transparency and approachability, continued training, and consistent professional conduct.” While there were tensions toward the end of Monday’s protest in Bangor between police and a smaller group of protesters who seemed unaffiliated with the original rally organizers, the crowd eventually dispersed. There were no arrests, according to police. We find hope in people like Dante McAllister, leading a “Black Lives Matter” chant and hugging and shaking hands with police in Bangor (though everyone needs to remember we’re still in the middle of a global pandemic!). We find hope in the officers taking a knee along with the protesters. “Their reaction wasn’t aggressive, they wanted to hear what I wanted to say,” McAllister said about the police officers. “And I told them, and showed it. We all have to love each other.” Bangor City Councilor Angela Okafor, who spoke at the protest, posted on Facebook after the event expressing her pride in the community for achieving “what people said we could not; a peaceful and unifying protest.” “We support our cops too while we fight for justice. Our cops blockaded the street and stood there in solidarity and protection of us. I honestly was very scared going in this evening.” Okafor said in the post. “Seeing our cops and my colleagues and several of our community leaders was very helpful in calming my anxiety to a huge extent. We started a very good dialogue here. Please let us not throw it away in the hands of the instigators.” Hugs, handshakes and kneeling together aren’t going to solve the longstanding problems of racism and inequality. But as seen Monday in communities like Bangor and Rockland, they are hopefully helping to lay the groundwork for sustained dialogue and much-needed change.",0.0

Act fast!” One day after a crackdown on peaceful protesters near the White House, thousands of demonstrators massed a block away from the presidential mansion, facing law enforcement personnel standing behind a black chain-link fence. The fence was put up overnight to block access to Lafayette Park, just across the street from the White House. “Last night pushed me way over the edge,” said Jessica DeMaio, 40, of Washington, who attended a Floyd protest Tuesday for the first time. “Being here is better than being at home feeling helpless.” The crowd remained in place after the city’s 7 p.m. curfew passed, defying warnings that the response from law enforcement could be even more forceful. But the protest lacked the tension of the previous nights’ demonstrations. The crowd Tuesday was peaceful, polite even. At one point, the crowd booed when a protester climbed a light post and took down a street sign. A chant went up: “Peaceful protest!” On Monday, law enforcement officers on foot and horseback aggressively drove protesters away from Lafayette Park, clearing the way for President Trump to do a photo op at nearby St. John’s Church. On Tuesday, pastors at the church prayed with demonstrators and handed out water bottles. Protests ranged across the U.S., including in New York City, Los Angeles, Miami, Houston, St. Paul, Minnesota, Columbia, South Carolina, and Orlando, Florida, where more than 1,000 people gathered in the afternoon to decry the killings of black people. “This has to change,” said 39-year-old Aisxia Batiste, an out-of-work massage therapist in Orlando. “Something has to give. We’re done. This is the beginning of the end of something. It has to be.” In New York, midtown Manhattan was pocked with battered storefronts after Monday’s protests. Macy’s flagship store was among those hit when crowds of people smashed windows and looted stores as they swept through the area. A police sergeant was hospitalized after being hit by a car in the Bronx, where people walked Tuesday between ransacked buildings and a burned-out car on the Grand Concourse, a commercial thoroughfare. Police made nearly 700 arrests and Mayor Bill de Blasio extended an 8 p.m. curfew all week. “We’re going to have a tough few days,” he warned, but added: “We’re going to beat it back.” He pleaded with community leaders to step forward and “create peace.” More than 20,000 National Guard members have been called up in 29 states to deal with the violence.

(Chris Bouchard | Aroostook Republican) Peaceful protest for George Floyd held in Caribou Nearly 40 people protested peacefully Monday evening in Caribou against the killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police. CARIBOU, Maine — Nearly 40 people protested peacefully Monday evening in Caribou against the killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police. There were no conflicts or confrontations as the group advocated for justice in Floyd’s death during the two-hour event, and for systemic change within the institution that allowed these deaths to occur. The Caribou protest was not the first held in Aroostook County. A protest organized by Otis Edgecomb was held May 30 in Presque Isle. Caleb Schwartz, lead coordinator for the Caribou protest, said he was inspired by Edgecomb to bring a similar event to Caribou. Schwarz hopes that people in the area will see that no matter how small their community is, their voices will be heard, he said. “We’re taught in school that history repeats itself,” he said. “The reason why we teach the holocaust is because we don’t want history to repeat itself. And by being here, together today, we’re doing our small part to make sure history doesn’t repeat itself.” The group met at the Caribou Public Library parking lot, and marched down Herschel Street and around to the Caribou Police Station, then to the end of High Street before looping back to the library, where the protest continued on the grass adjacent to the intersection of High and Main streets. Edgecomb in a speech outside the library before the march began described the current state of America as simultaneously terrifying, beautiful, heartbreaking, heartwarming, confusing, sad, and, most importantly, needed. “We are here to march in memory of and for the eventual justice of George Floyd who was murdered just south of Minneapolis, Minnesota, while being detained by four officers,” Edgecomb said in a speech outside the library before the march. “I thank all of you who found the courage and empathy in your heart to get out of your comfort zone and join us here today.” The enemy is not law enforcement, Democrats, Republicans, protesters, or the people who support Democratic presidential candidate Joseph Biden or Republican President Donald Trump, he said. “The enemy is hate,” he said. “The enemy is injustice. The enemy is not speaking up and supporting each other to enact these systemic changes that must be done.” The marching protesters were met with a positive response from onlookers and people in their vehicles, with only a couple making mocking remarks and squealing their tires to drown out protesters’ chanting. Edgecomb said the Presque Isle march was the first protest he’d ever led, and that he was motivated after watching the video of officer Derek Chauvin killing Floyd by placing his knee on his neck for nearly nine minutes as he pleaded for his life. “I couldn’t get through it,’ he said. “I started bawling and crying, and each time I watched it, it got harder and harder. I just thought that this could’ve been my brother or my son. It could’ve been anyone.” Future protests will be held in Presque Isle on Saturdays at the Aroostook Center Mall parking at 9 a.m., Edgecomb said.",0.0

Susan Collins, R-Maine, criticized the use of tear gas to disperse peaceful protesters ahead of President Donald Trump’s photo op at a Washington, D.C., church Monday, saying the president came off as “unsympathetic” and “insensitive” to protesters’ rights. The Maine senator’s remarks followed a chaotic night in the nation’s capital after protesters outside of the White House, who had been peacefully assembled, were met with flash-bang explosions and tear gas shortly before the city’s 7 p.m. curfew. While protesters and police clashed, Trump delivered a televised address from the Rose Garden in which he called himself an “ally of peaceful protesters” but said he would send the military to states if governors could not keep the protests under control. After, the president walked through the area where protesters had previously gathered to the nearby St. John’s Church, where he held up a Bible for assembled cameras. “It was painful to watch peaceful protestors be subjected to tear gas in order for the president to go across the street to a church I believe he’s attended only once,” Collins reportedly told reporters in D.C. “I thought that the president came across as unsympathetic and as insensitive to the rights of people to peaceful protest,” she added. Protests have erupted across the country — including Portland, Bangor and several other Maine cities and towns — over the last week, triggered by the killing of George Floyd, a black man in Minneapolis who died by asphyxiation after a white police officer kneeled on his neck for eight minutes. Collins, who was vocal about her opposition to Trump prior to his election in 2016, has declined on several occasions to say whether she plans to vote for him this year. The president will visit Maine on Friday to tour the Puritan Medical Products facility in Guilford despite concerns raised by Gov. Janet Mills that his visit could prompt unrest. Collins has said she will be working in Washington, D.C., that day and will not be attending alongside Trump.",0.0

Officers moved to clear the streets of protesters who remained out past a citywide curfew when they arrested Martínez Contreras. He was issued a summons for failing to obey an order to disperse and was released from police custody early Tuesday morning. Also on Monday, Delaware News Journal reporter Jeff Neiburg and video strategist Jenna Miller were covering protests in Philadelphia when they were detained for about two hours, despite showing their credentials several times and saying they were media. They were released shortly after 9 p.m. and won't be charged. Cincinnati Enquirer reporter Patrick Brennan was briefly detained Monday evening by police while covering protests in the city. Media are essential workers and were exempt from the citywide curfew. Brennan was released without being charged. Cincinnati Police later apologized for the incident.

In a video apparently recorded in a police transport vehicle while still at the Merle Hay Mall and then posted on Twitter, Sahouri said police sprayed her in the face with pepper spray after she identified herself as a member of the media. ""I'm press. I'm press. I'm press,"" she said she told police. KCCI earlier showed Sahouri sitting on a curb with her hands zip tied behind her back. It appeared she was wailing in pain from the pepper spray. Another reporter who was with her at the event was not arrested but shared the same account with editors before Sahouri posted her video on Twitter. Sahouri was released hours later and charged with failure to disperse and interference with official acts. On Saturday night, Branden Hunter, a reporter for the Detroit Free Press, went to an emergency room in Detroit after police administered tear gas during a protest. A cellphone, which was livestreaming the event, was knocked from a Free Press photographer's hand. Free Press reporter JC Reindl was taken to an emergency room after he was pepper sprayed, though he showed a badge identifying himself as a member of the media. Last thing I saw before I got sprayed.

Penney in the area and was treated for a concussion at a hospital. Got a knot on my head, scrapes, bruises from head to foot and a concussion.

Davis, a Des Moines Register reporter, was in Minneapolis Thursday, detailing the night of demonstrations when he observed police using chemical irritants to subdue protesters. ""I pulled out my camera to record the incident while being sure not to walk toward officers or have any other items in my hand,"" Davis wrote in an essay for USA TODAY. ""The officer redirected his chemical spray from the fleeing duo toward me."" Davis said the officer ""laid on the trigger for a few seconds"" as Davis told him he was a journalist. ""My eyes refused to open, and my face and arm felt as if they were dipped in a deep-fryer,"" he wrote. According to USA TODAY reporter Natalie Neysa Alund, Louisville police shoved Memphis Commercial Appeal photographer Max Gersh twice with their batons. Journalists covering peaceful protest in Lafayette pushed back with tear gas While several journalists were covering a peaceful protest at Lafayette Square outside the White House on Monday evening, federal law enforcement cleared the area using tear gas and flash-bang grenades before a curfew took place in Washington, D.C.

His live shot was interrupted by protesters at Lafayette Park in Washington, who shouted obscenities directed at Fox. Flanked by two security guards, he and photographer Christian Galdabini walked away, trailed by an angry group before riot police dispersed them.

Saturday night, MSNBC journalist Ali Velshi wrote on Twitter that he was ""hit in the leg by a rubber bullet"" in Minneapolis but was fine. ""State Police supported by National guard fired unprovoked into an entirely peaceful rally,"" he said. 'Fired tear gas ... at point blank range' Los Angeles Times journalist Molly Hennessy-Fiske said Saturday evening that she was at the 5th Precinct in Minneapolis with ""at least a dozen"" journalists when members of the Minnesota State Patrol advanced toward the group. She said the journalists identified themselves, but officers ""fired tear gas canisters on us at point-blank range."" Hennessy-Fiske said they asked officers where they should go to avoid dispersal tactics. ""They did not tell us where to go,"" she said. ""They did not direct us. They just fired on us."" She said she ""got hit with a rubber bullet ... maybe two."" Reuters producer Julio César Chávez said early Sunday morning that he ""was shot in the arm and the back of my neck with rubber bullets"" and his security adviser ""was shot in the face,"" though a gas mask protected him. Another Reuters photographer, Lucas Jackson, said that late Saturday night in Minneapolis a man disguised as a medic attacked him with a crowbar, breaking the camera he was using to document the protests. He was ""a white man with a Red Cross on his chest who came out of nowhere,"" Jackson said. Vice News correspondent and producer Michael Anthony Adams shared video of Minneapolis troopers approaching him and several other journalists Sunday morning at a gas station where they had taken shelter.

The Las Vegas Review-Journal reported that Saturday, photographer Ellen Schmidt and freelance photographer and former Review-Journal employee Bridget Bennett were arrested while covering protests on the Strip. In Louisville early Saturday morning, protesters vandalized a car with the logo of news station WLKY on the driver side door. According to one of the station's reporters, Deni Kamper, chief photographer Paul Ahmann was attacked by a mob of protesters and thrown to the ground. Kamper posted on Twitter that Ahmann was ""being treated but is also ok."" The previous day in Louisville, WAVE 3 News reporter Kaitlin Rust and photojournalist James Dobson were struck by pepper balls fired at them by a Louisville Metro Police Department officer.

(Chris Bouchard | Aroostook Republican) Peaceful protest for George Floyd held in Caribou Nearly 40 people protested peacefully Monday evening in Caribou against the killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police. CARIBOU, Maine — Nearly 40 people protested peacefully Monday evening in Caribou against the killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police. There were no conflicts or confrontations as the group advocated for justice in Floyd’s death during the two-hour event, and for systemic change within the institution that allowed these deaths to occur. The Caribou protest was not the first held in Aroostook County. A protest organized by Otis Edgecomb was held May 30 in Presque Isle. Caleb Schwartz, lead coordinator for the Caribou protest, said he was inspired by Edgecomb to bring a similar event to Caribou. Schwarz hopes that people in the area will see that no matter how small their community is, their voices will be heard, he said. “We’re taught in school that history repeats itself,” he said. “The reason why we teach the holocaust is because we don’t want history to repeat itself. And by being here, together today, we’re doing our small part to make sure history doesn’t repeat itself.” The group met at the Caribou Public Library parking lot, and marched down Herschel Street and around to the Caribou Police Station, then to the end of High Street before looping back to the library, where the protest continued on the grass adjacent to the intersection of High and Main streets. Edgecomb in a speech outside the library before the march began described the current state of America as simultaneously terrifying, beautiful, heartbreaking, heartwarming, confusing, sad, and, most importantly, needed. “We are here to march in memory of and for the eventual justice of George Floyd who was murdered just south of Minneapolis, Minnesota, while being detained by four officers,” Edgecomb said in a speech outside the library before the march. “I thank all of you who found the courage and empathy in your heart to get out of your comfort zone and join us here today.” The enemy is not law enforcement, Democrats, Republicans, protesters, or the people who support Democratic presidential candidate Joseph Biden or Republican President Donald Trump, he said. “The enemy is hate,” he said. “The enemy is injustice. The enemy is not speaking up and supporting each other to enact these systemic changes that must be done.” The marching protesters were met with a positive response from onlookers and people in their vehicles, with only a couple making mocking remarks and squealing their tires to drown out protesters’ chanting. Edgecomb said the Presque Isle march was the first protest he’d ever led, and that he was motivated after watching the video of officer Derek Chauvin killing Floyd by placing his knee on his neck for nearly nine minutes as he pleaded for his life. “I couldn’t get through it,’ he said. “I started bawling and crying, and each time I watched it, it got harder and harder. I just thought that this could’ve been my brother or my son. It could’ve been anyone.” Future protests will be held in Presque Isle on Saturdays at the Aroostook Center Mall parking at 9 a.m., Edgecomb said.",0.0

Trump last week tweeted that “when the looting begins, the shooting begins,” which many people interpreted as a call for violence in nationwide protests over the death of George Floyd. Twitter put a warning label on the tweet, flagging it as violent content that broke the company’s policies but was being left up because it was newsworthy. Facebook declined to take any action on a similar post on its site. In response, dozens of Facebook employees participated in a virtual walkout Monday, and many more expressed outrage in internal forums and on Twitter. At least two people who say they are employees have resigned, according to public posts and tweets and conversations with workers. During the town hall, Zuckerberg did not back down from his decision to keep up the post, according to several employees who were listening but declined to provide their names for fear of retribution. At least five people have died in nationwide protests that began this weekend. Thousands more have been tear-gassed and injured. Facebook’s policy says it removes language that incites or facilitates serious violence. Zuckerberg defended his decision that the post did not constitute a policy violation at the town hall, and he walked employees through different interpretations of Trump’s language. But Zuckerberg said he would review the transparency of the processes around how pieces of content get escalated to senior managers. He also said he would be open to reviewing how the company handles content regarding state violence, a nod to the growing use of force at the protests. Two of the people who attended said that seemed like a minor concession that did not appear to appease the many angry employees, some of whom repeatedly pointed out in questions that very few black people were attending the town hall. The decisions at Facebook have prompted some people who say they are employees to publicly resign. Facebook did not immediately respond to requests to verify those people’s status. Timothy Aveni, a software engineer according to his Facebook page, said in a public resignation letter that he was disappointed in Zuckerberg’s leadership. “Mark always told us that he would draw the line at speech that calls for violence,” Aveni wrote. “He showed us on Friday that this was a lie. Facebook will keep moving the goalposts every time Trump escalates, finding excuse after excuse not to act on increasingly dangerous rhetoric.” Send questions/comments to the editors. « Previous Next »",0.0

Brunswick Police Cmdr. Mark Waltz said he has had dozens of “very insightful” conversations over the past few days, and the department hopes to involve some of the protesters in training exercises with officers. Others expressed interest in a larger, townwide meeting. However, with limits on social gatherings during the coronavirus pandemic, Waltz said that was not immediately possible, but “we absolutely get the message and are willing to talk.” Hundreds gathered Sunday on the Brunswick downtown mall before marching to the police station, in protest of police brutality following the death of George Floyd, a black man in Minnesota who was killed last week by a white police officer. The Minneapolis officer, Derek Chauvin, knelt on Floyd’s neck for almost nine minutes, despite Floyd’s cries that he could not breathe. The video of Floyd’s death, coupled with heightened tensions over a series of other racial and police-related deaths in recent few months, has sparked outrage and protests across country. “Tensions everywhere are like a tinderbox right now,” Waltz said, attributing some of that to “a lot of misunderstanding on both sides.” He said officers will have to work toward putting themselves in others’ shoes and trying to be aware of when people may feel unsafe. Related Protesters with Black Lives Matter movement descend on Brunswick Police Department In the same vein, though, Waltz said crowding police and immediately questioning officers’ actions can also create tension. “We need to have more understanding on both sides,” he said. Waltz commended protester Toby Holton, who he said helped calm the crowd Sunday night, even as tensions started to rise. “I can tell you that many of us were scared,” Waltz said, “not because we’re cowards, but because if there were a few more agitators, that could have gone in the opposite direction.” “We don’t want people hurt, we don’t want officers hurt and we don’t want property damaged,” he said. On Sunday, Holton said he was recently pulled over by a Brunswick Police officer and was afraid, but said the interaction ultimately was peaceful. Hearing about Holton’s initial fear was important, Waltz said, because officers may not always know when someone is feeling unsafe. Holton started “important dialogue we needed to hear,” he said. In Bath, roughly 50 people protested peacefully on Monday, marching from the courthouse to City Hall to the police department. Bath police officers did not join the protest, Chief Mike Field said, because the gathering remained peaceful and he did not want the officers to disrupt or get in the way of their message. None of the protestors or event organizers have reached out to the department yet, Field said, though he said he’s willing to meet with anybody who has concerns. Related Black Lives Matter protesters march in Bath Field condemned Chauvin’s actions in a press release on Tuesday, and said what happened to Floyd was “wrong, criminal, against any police practice I know, and shocked me and our police officers to the core.” The action has damaged the department’s continuing efforts to build trust in the community, he added. “I don’t want people to be scared of us,” he said in an interview. “We’re part of the community. We have a job to do to maintain public safety, but if people are scared, I want to hear about it, I want to have that discussion.” Field also said in his statement that the department will not tolerate any form of racism. “People will be treated equally and fairly. When action must be taken, it will be within policy, and at the least level needed. If anything other than that occurs, we will hold officers accountable,” he said. He added that he hopes these protests will open avenues for communication that can lead to peace and healing. Joel Merry, Sagadahoc County Sheriff, also said he has not been contacted by any protesters, but that he would “welcome the opportunity to sit down and talk to anyone about any issues.” “I think the more dialogue that we can have, the better we can begin to understand and get to view one another’s take on the things that are happening,” he said. Merry applauded the protesters for remaining peaceful, staying on the sidewalk, not blocking traffic and not vandalizing any property, as has been the case in some rallies in other parts of the country. “I believe there was an opportunity for folks to show that over time our country hasn’t effectively or properly addressed the issues related to racial inequality. … We need to have that conversation that there still remains racism in our country today and the only way to do that is to civilly sit down and express our point of view and listen,” he said. “There’s a lot of anger out there and we’re got to let the anger out but in a constructive way so these folks can be heard.” Merry added that he hopes the voices of the people who want to be heard will rise above those who are looting and destroying property and not let their message be “clouded by the senseless acts of violence and destruction.” The department’s deputies have received implicit bias training and take issues around treating everyone fairly very seriously, he said, and asked that any future protests continue to be done peacefully. “It makes (the message) much clearer,” he said. “We look forward to the dialogue.

Protests, vigils and marches have swept the country in reaction to the death of George Floyd, a black man who was killed when a Minneapolis police officer held Floyd down with a knee to the back of Floyd’s neck. In Bath, protesters chanted “I can’t breathe,” in reference to Floyd and Eric Garner, a black man in New York who died while being restrained by a police officer. Both men were recorded saying “I can’t breathe” in the moments before their death. Devin Moore, 28, of Bath, said the march was an opportunity to unify the city where he’s lived most of his life. “Everybody’s affected by these things,” he said. While Black Lives Matter is the narrative, “It’s not just black people. It’s deeper than that.” Those who may not understand what it’s like to be black or experience racism also come to a Black Lives Matter march to become educated, Moore said. “I learn from everyone,” he said. “I learn not to judge.” Reporter Darcie Moore is not related to Devin Moore.

Joel Merry, Sagadahoc County Sheriff, also said he has not been contacted by any protesters, but that he would “welcome the opportunity to sit down and talk to anyone about any issues.” “I think the more dialogue that we can have, the better we can begin to understand and get to view one another’s take on the things that are happening,” he said. Merry applauded the protesters for remaining peaceful, staying on the sidewalk, not blocking traffic and not vandalizing any property, as has been the case in some rallies in other parts of the country. “I believe there was an opportunity for folks to show that over time our country hasn’t effectively or properly addressed the issues related to racial inequality. … We need to have that conversation that there still remains racism in our country today and the only way to do that is to civilly sit down and express our point of view and listen,” he said. “There’s a lot of anger out there and we’re got to let the anger out but in a constructive way so these folks can be heard.” Merry added that he hopes the voices of the people who want to be heard will rise above those who are looting and destroying property and not let their message be “clouded by the senseless acts of violence and destruction.” The department’s deputies have received implicit bias training and take issues around treating everyone fairly very seriously, he said, and asked that any future protests continue to be done peacefully. “It makes (the message) much clearer,” he said. “We look forward to the dialogue.

(Ringo H.W. Chiu | AP) ‘United We Stand, Divided We Fall’ event planned in Fort Kent A peaceful gathering is planned in Fort Kent to unite people in the aftermath of the killing of a black man who died on a Minneapolis street while police arrested him. FORT KENT, Maine — A peaceful gathering is planned in Fort Kent to unite people in the aftermath of the killing of a black man who died on a Minneapolis street while police arrested him. George Floyd, 46, died while Minneapolis Police Officer Derek Chauvin kneeled on his neck for more than 8 minutes during the May 25 arrest. Multiple passersby recorded the incident on their cell phones and pleaded with officers, including Chauvin, to release Floyd, who complained that he could not breathe. Chauvin has since been arrested on charges of third degree murder and second degree manslaughter in relation to Floyd’s death. In the days since Floyd died, peaceful protests and deadly riots have taken place throughout the country, demanding justice for Floyd and systemic reforms regarding race relations in the United States. Jennifer Schlott-Green, 41, who describes herself as “multiracial,” has organized a “United We Stand, Divided We Fall” event to take place at noon Wednesday at the Fort Kent Public Library. “My brother and nephews, while multiracial, could be the next George Floyd,” Schlott-Green said. Schott-Green said this is not her only reason for planning the event. “I am personally sickened that any one person thinks they are better than anyone else to the point of taking a life, especially when that person is in a position of power,” she said. “Change is long overdue.” The mother of three biological daughters, 20, 17 and 15, a stepson, 8, and a 16-year-old foster son, Schlott-Green said she also wants the event to be a learning experience for her children. “I have children that need to know their voice can be heard and change is possible,” Schlott-Green said. “It is what America is all about — freedoms. And being silent is just as bad as doing the deed. I have children that need to know their voice can be heard and change is possible. Get out and let your voices be heard.” Schlott- Green grew up in Virginia Beach, Virginia, and has lived in the St. John Valley for 12 years. She said she is a “proud” Fort Kent resident. “It is an amazing place and I wouldn’t want to be anywhere else at this moment,” Schlott-Green said. “However, just because we are not experiencing the effects of what is happening around the U.S. with the riots and looting, I feel it is important to show understanding, compassion and support of the need for change — the need for equality for people regardless of their skin color or ethnicity. Even if we aren’t experiencing discrimination ourselves, we have a responsibility as Americans to be educated and exercise our rights to be treated equally.” “We are all human,” Schlott Green added. “There is one race, the human race, and we are killing ourselves.” The “United We Stand, Divided We Fall” event is about more than race relations, Schlott-Green said. “There is too much focus on Democrat and Republican. We are all Americans,” Schlott-Green said. “One thing the riots/protests have visually shown everyone is it is a mixture of whites, blacks, Latinos, democrats, republicans, old and young. They are all Americans coming together for the same purpose — to be heard.” Schlott-Green notified Fort Kent Police Chief Tom Pelletier about the event. “I have reassured him if things get out of hand a call will be made immediately and we will disperse,” Schlott-Green said. “Destruction does not accomplish anything. We need solidarity, smarts and sympathy.” Chief Pelletier said he had a positive conversation with Schlott-Green about the planned event, which he will attend. “I very much support her and all who attend as long as it doesn’t involve any property destruction,” Chief Pelletier said. “I will be the first one to support them in a peaceful demonstration.” Similar events took place in Aroostook County on Monday evening in Caribou and Saturday, May 30, in Presque Isle. “I would like to encourage everyone to exercise their right to peaceful protest, their right to vote in November and to stay educated,” Schlott-Green said. “Knowledge is power.” Fort Kent Public Library is located at 1 Monument Square in downtown Fort Kent.",0.0
1623681572,2020-06-02 17:56:47,Portland chief meets with protest organizers as demonstrations continue,https://www.pressherald.com/2020/06/02/portland-chief-meets-with-protest-organizers-as-demonstrations-continue/,en,False,,366984,pressherald.com,http://pressherald.com/,"City officials Tuesday spoke with the leaders of two groups that have brought more than 1,000 demonstrators into Portland’s streets over the past four days to protest racism and police brutality. Portland’s police chief, city manager and mayor, along with other state and local officials, met virtually on Tuesday with two organizers of the downtown protests to listen to concerns that have fueled angry marches around the country. Officials also made contact with a third organizer, whose rally Monday night turned destructive and confrontational and led to a prolonged clash with police that lasted into Tuesday morning. The meetings and phone calls represent a game of catch-up for city officials, who had been trying to make contact with organizers since Friday, City Manager Jon Jennings said. Part of the delay stems from the shutdown of city government in response to the coronavirus pandemic, he said, and the organic nature of the demonstrations themselves. “What happened in Minnesota was beyond outrageous,” Jennings said. “So we understand the anger that’s in the community. So, in the beginning we’ve wanted to work cooperatively with them but we didn’t really know who the organizers were.” Jennings said typically when groups want to demonstrate, they can communicate with city officials. But the COVID-19 response has led to furloughs, including of the permitting staff who typically handle requests for police and city assistance during demonstrations. That left the city without a clear idea of logistics or what to expect. Hamdia Ahmed and Abdul Ali, who organized a protest on Friday and are now planning a demonstration Wednesday outside the Portland police station, met via a Zoom meeting with city leaders to discuss issues of race and policing, and the broad, overarching issue of police treatment of black and brown people across the country, Police Chief Frank Clark said. The problems are systemic, Ahmed said, and she did not single out the Portland department, according to Clark. Other participants in the meeting were Portland Mayor Kate Snyder, Maine Commissioner of Public Safety Michael Sauschuck, Cumberland County District Attorney Jonathan Sahrbeck, Westbrook Police Chief Janine Roberts, Portland City Councilor Pious Ali and representatives of the Portland school department, said Jessica Grondin, a city spokeswoman. “We did a lot of listening,” Clark said. “They articulated that they wanted to be heard. They wanted us to hear them. We vowed to continue the conversations.” Ahmed told the police leaders they wanted the protests to be peaceful, Clark said. Reached Tuesday, Ahmed declined to speak to a reporter. Jennings, the city manager, has also kept in contact with another organizer, David Thete, who put together the demonstration on Monday evening that drew an estimated 1,000 protesters and later turned violent and confrontational. Jennings said he is working to get Clark and Thete to meet, and to arrange for Clark to speak to demonstrators at some point, but it was unclear whether he would do so Tuesday night or at some point in the future. Thete’s group has sought since Friday to place a memorial on the steps leading to the Portland Police station dedicated to all people of color killed by police, but repeatedly that memorial has been moved or taken down after demonstrations subside. On Tuesday, Jennings reached a compromise. Signs, candles and other mementos will be moved away from the staircase so they don’t block the staircase. Jennings also addressed police and protester conduct at the Monday rally, and blamed agitators from out of state for causing trouble. “The police were not antagonistic until it began to spiral out of control, meaning there were rocks in socks being flung, bottles of urine being thrown at officers, bricks being thrown at officers,” Jennings said. “At some point you have to take matters into your hands to restore public order. The folks who were causing the problems last night were not part of the people (demonstrating), they were coming from all over New England, from Massachusetts.” Asked how he knew the home community of some of the roughly 1,000 people who crammed the streets, he at first said the city has “sources and methods.” He said police, to his knowledge, are not monitoring cell phone traffic, but instead are monitoring social media. “Do you have SnapChat?” Jennings said. Different groups of demonstrators have gathered by the hundreds in downtown Portland since last Friday, as similar and sometimes more violent protests erupted in cities across the country. Ahmed organized a demonstration last Friday in which hundreds of people blocked traffic along Franklin Street and at Congress Square Park near High and Congress streets. Thete’s demonstration – also last Friday – saw hundreds of other demonstrators march on City Hall and the police station on Middle Street. Thete’s group returned Sunday, and demonstrators demanded to meet with Clark. Clark did not address a crowd of protesters who gathered outside the police station Sunday. On Monday, he said he reached out to organizers to arrange a meeting or meetings. Requests for an interview with Thete left through social media were not returned Monday or Tuesday, and Ahmed said Tuesday afternoon she would release a statement regarding Clark’s offer, and declined to speak on the phone. Clark on Tuesday said he is viewing the confrontation and the escalation that occurred Monday as an anomaly. “We certainly won’t condone breaking the law and the destruction of property,” Clark said. “But we’re literally going into this as a new day, and hope we see the level of cooperation we had (last) Friday and we’re going to ask people and plead with people to work with us in that regard.” Clark has made several statements condemning Floyd’s death, but has not directly called the incident murder as some police officials in other cities have. Other city officials have spoken about Floyd’s death and the demonstrations, which have taken place in hundreds of cities across the country and drawn millions of participants demanding racial justice and police reform. Portland’s City Council passed a resolution Monday condemning the recent killings of unarmed black men in other states and “all forms of racism and police brutality.” The resolution says city leaders pledge to protect the rights of all people and commits to “calling out hate and discrimination when we see it.” Mayor Kate Snyder spoke in support of the council’s proclamation condemning racism and police brutality, and has posted messages on Facebook condemning the killing of Floyd and supporting the peaceful protests. In a video posted on Facebook Monday, Snyder says she was outraged, stunned, sad and left speechless by Floyd’s death. She thanked those speaking up and shining light “on this horrific crime” and offered love and compassion to Floyd’s family and his community, and to the Portland community. On Tuesday, she posted that she plans to attend a peaceful protest Wednesday afternoon in Portland. Her posts have generated some support, as well as criticism from people who want the mayor and other city leaders to be more visible and to address the outrage publicly.

Brunswick Police Cmdr. Mark Waltz said he has had dozens of “very insightful” conversations over the past few days, and the department hopes to involve some of the protesters in training exercises with officers. Others expressed interest in a larger, townwide meeting. However, with limits on social gatherings during the coronavirus pandemic, Waltz said that was not immediately possible, but “we absolutely get the message and are willing to talk.” Hundreds gathered Sunday on the Brunswick downtown mall before marching to the police station, in protest of police brutality following the death of George Floyd, a black man in Minnesota who was killed last week by a white police officer. The Minneapolis officer, Derek Chauvin, knelt on Floyd’s neck for almost nine minutes, despite Floyd’s cries that he could not breathe. The video of Floyd’s death, coupled with heightened tensions over a series of other racial and police-related deaths in recent few months, has sparked outrage and protests across country. “Tensions everywhere are like a tinderbox right now,” Waltz said, attributing some of that to “a lot of misunderstanding on both sides.” He said officers will have to work toward putting themselves in others’ shoes and trying to be aware of when people may feel unsafe. Related Protesters with Black Lives Matter movement descend on Brunswick Police Department In the same vein, though, Waltz said crowding police and immediately questioning officers’ actions can also create tension. “We need to have more understanding on both sides,” he said. Waltz commended protester Toby Holton, who he said helped calm the crowd Sunday night, even as tensions started to rise. “I can tell you that many of us were scared,” Waltz said, “not because we’re cowards, but because if there were a few more agitators, that could have gone in the opposite direction.” “We don’t want people hurt, we don’t want officers hurt and we don’t want property damaged,” he said. On Sunday, Holton said he was recently pulled over by a Brunswick Police officer and was afraid, but said the interaction ultimately was peaceful. Hearing about Holton’s initial fear was important, Waltz said, because officers may not always know when someone is feeling unsafe. Holton started “important dialogue we needed to hear,” he said. In Bath, roughly 50 people protested peacefully on Monday, marching from the courthouse to City Hall to the police department. Bath police officers did not join the protest, Chief Mike Field said, because the gathering remained peaceful and he did not want the officers to disrupt or get in the way of their message. None of the protestors or event organizers have reached out to the department yet, Field said, though he said he’s willing to meet with anybody who has concerns. Related Black Lives Matter protesters march in Bath Field condemned Chauvin’s actions in a press release on Tuesday, and said what happened to Floyd was “wrong, criminal, against any police practice I know, and shocked me and our police officers to the core.” The action has damaged the department’s continuing efforts to build trust in the community, he added. “I don’t want people to be scared of us,” he said in an interview. “We’re part of the community. We have a job to do to maintain public safety, but if people are scared, I want to hear about it, I want to have that discussion.” Field also said in his statement that the department will not tolerate any form of racism. “People will be treated equally and fairly. When action must be taken, it will be within policy, and at the least level needed. If anything other than that occurs, we will hold officers accountable,” he said. He added that he hopes these protests will open avenues for communication that can lead to peace and healing. Joel Merry, Sagadahoc County Sheriff, also said he has not been contacted by any protesters, but that he would “welcome the opportunity to sit down and talk to anyone about any issues.” “I think the more dialogue that we can have, the better we can begin to understand and get to view one another’s take on the things that are happening,” he said.

Polls began to close Tuesday night as voters navigated curfews and health concerns in a slate of primary contests that tested the nation's ability to host elections amid dueling crises and moved Joe Biden closer to formally clinching the Democratic presidential nomination. In all, nine states and the District of Columbia held elections, including four that delayed their April contests because of the coronavirus outbreak. Biden easily won Indiana, which was the first state to begin closing polls at 7 p.m. Voting continued across Washington, D.C. and Pennsylvania, two places rocked by protests following the police killing of George Floyd. The dynamic was especially intense in Washington, where Mayor Muriel Bowser imposed a 7 p.m. curfew as law enforcement agencies and National Guard troops prepared for a fifth night of social unrest near the White House. A large fence was erected in front of the White House and military vehicles blocked some streets in downtown. While voters cast ballots from Maryland to Montana, Pennsylvania offered the day's biggest trove of delegates. The state also represented a significant test case for Republicans and Democrats working to strengthen their operations in a premier general election battleground. In-person voting numbers were down in every state as many voters were encouraged to vote by mail because of the coronavirus pandemic. Yet there were reports of long lines, particularly in minority communities in the Philadelphia area, where election officials consolidated the vast majority of polling places to minimize health risks, according to Erin Kramer, executive director of One Pennsylvania. She noted that some polling places in African American communities are in police stations. ""Having to stand in line while police officers are entering and exiting the building on police business is not exactly how people want to spend their election day,"" Kramer said. Biden was on the primary ballot in almost every state in his bid to unify Democrats behind his campaign against Trump. The former vice president is already the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, given that all his rivals have dropped out of the race, but he needs to win 89% of all delegates at stake on Tuesday to formally clinch the nomination. If he doesn't secure the needed delegates Tuesday, he has other opportunities to do so this month. Biden was in Philadelphia on Tuesday morning to deliver remarks about the civil unrest that has erupted across the nation. He didn't talk about the primary, instead focusing his attention on Trump, whom Biden blasted as ""more interested in power than in principle."" Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is not actively campaigning, having suspended his operation and endorsed Biden, but his name will appear on the ballots. On the eve of Tuesday's primaries, senior adviser Jeff Weaver encouraged progressives to vote for Sanders anyway. ""People who support Bernie Sanders and his agenda, who want to maximize the influence of progressives at the convention, should cast their vote for Bernie Sanders,"" Weaver said, reminding voters that the Vermont senator is seeking leverage to shape the party's platform and rules. The comments serve as a reminder that Biden may have no legitimate Democratic rivals remaining but must still win over skeptical activists from his party's far-left flank, who worry he's too close to the political establishment. Party unity will likely be an afterthought this week, however, as more immediate health and safety concerns dominate the national conversation. The coronavirus death toll has surged past 100,000 nationwide, and thousands of new cases are reported each day. At the same time, several major cities, including some voting Tuesday, are grappling with protests. Some voters said Trump's increasingly tough tone toward protesters inspired them to participate in the democratic process. Nicholas Autiello, who works in finance in Rhode Island, said he was disturbed by police driving back peaceful demonstrators near the White House on Monday. ""Last night, we have a president who is acting like a dictator,"" Autiello said. ""So being able to come out here this morning and fill in a circle next to a name for someone who I know will restore honor and decency to the presidency was so important."" In Washington, the mayor ordered a 7 p.m. curfew, though voting places will be open until 8 p.m. Voting has been deemed essential, and city officials say voters will not be subject to arrest if they cast ballots during the curfew. Philadelphia moved its 6 p.m. curfew back to 8:30 p.m. for Tuesday to accommodate voting. ""We are in unique times, and voting is a unique challenge for people,"" said Josh Schwerin, chief strategist for the pro-Democrat super PAC Priorities USA. He said that his organization and others will be watching closely on Tuesday ""to see how well it works, where issues are and where obstacles have been put in place."" Political groups have had to adjust as some states move to a system that relies largely on voting by mail. They include Montana, where all 56 counties decided to vote entirely by mail. Voting rights watchdogs in multiple states have expressed concerns about access to mail ballots, confusion about deadlines and a shortage of poll workers that could lead to long lines. Those voting Tuesday include the District of Columbia, Indiana, Maryland, Montana, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and South Dakota. Two other states holding primary elections, Idaho and Iowa, chose its presidential nominee early in the year and is now focused on other offices. ""We think we're prepared,"" Pennsylvania Democratic Party Chairwoman Nancy Patton Mills said. ""Thank goodness we have the opportunity of working this out in the primary because we don't know where we'll be with the pandemic in November.""",0.0

Twenty-three people were arrested Monday night on misdemeanor charges during what has so far been the largest protest against police brutality in Maine. The Cumberland County Sheriff's Office says out of the arrests, all but two were charged with failure to disperse and released on unsecured bail bonds. The protest, organized by a Portland man who identifies as a member of the group Black Lives Matter, drew an estimated 1,000 people into the Old Port area of Portland Monday night, just one week after 46-year-old George Floyd died in Minneapolis as a police officer knelt on his neck, despite his cries that he couldn't breathe. The now-former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin has since been charged with manslaughter and murder. The other three officers involved have yet to be charged. Protesters around the nation have cried out for justice since Floyd's death. Since then, police departments from Augusta to Portland and from Bangor to Brunswick have expressed ""disgust"" at the killing and even marched with the protesters.

Nyamuon ""Moon"" Nguany Machar, who works with Disability Rights Maine and acts as a cultural liaison for New Mainers, said that two different factions identify as members of the group Black Lives Matters, and each has held protests in the past week. Tuesday morning, the Facebook group BLM Portland posted about Monday's protest: ""Last night PPD proved, as though there were ever any doubt, that police brutality and systemic violence are as deeply rooted here, as they are in any city across the country. While aggressing on protesters, shooting tear gas and rubber pellets, they made upwards of 20 arrests. BLM Portland organizers were on the ground and at the jail to ensure the safe release of those arrested. At 5:45 a[.m.], all protesters we released and their bail waived."" Machar said she spent much of early Tuesday at the Cumberland County Jail, making sure those arrested were ok and had a ride home. She said that as she drove several of those arrested back to their homes, she questioned them about the event and tried to thank them, but that she could tell from their lack of awareness that they were actually protest, and she noted some were intoxicated. She said she heard people she didn't know talking about looting and then laughing, and she told them, ""That's not what we're here for."" At one point, she said she stepped between a tall, white man and an officer to diffuse a confrontation. ""I thought, 'If another Black body comes here, and is not female and is Black and is taller than me, this aggression is going to lead to something that devastates an entire community."" Machar said she is angry that the people who publicized the protest left prior to the escalation later in the evening, and no one remained to take care of younger members of the community—including one 14-year-old girl who was carried home by her brother after getting pepper spray in her veil, Machar said. In a release, Portland Police Chief Frank Clark wrote that the city and his department respect the rights of protesters. ""We understand and are also disgusted by the recent tragedy,"" he added.

1623698033,2020-06-02 18:20:46,GOP criticism muted on Trump’s handling of protests,https://www.pressherald.com/2020/06/02/gop-criticism-muted-on-trumps-handling-of-protests/,en,False,,366984,pressherald.com,http://pressherald.com/,"WASHINGTON — Most Republicans continued Tuesday to avoid any criticism of President Trump, though a handful of GOP senators spoke out against police use of tear gas to clear peaceful demonstrators from a park near the White House so Trump could walk to a nearby church and pose with a Bible. “There is no right to riot, no right to destroy others’ property … but there is a fundamental – a Constitutional – right to protest, and I’m against clearing out a peaceful protest for a photo op that treats the Word of God as a political prop,” said Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse. South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, the only black Republican in the Senate, said he did not think Trump’s visit to St. John’s Church was helpful. “Obviously, if your question is, should you use tear gas to clear a path so the president can go have a photo-op, the answer is no,” Scott told Politico Tuesday, while noting he did not personally see the incident. Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, said it was “painful to watch peaceful protestors be subjected to tear gas in order for the president to go across the street to a church that I believe he’s attended only once.” While Americans are justifiably upset that the historic church was set on fire and vandalized, “I thought that the president came across as unsympathetic and insensitive,” she said. At a time when a president “ought to be trying to calm the nation,″ Trump did not do that, said Collins, who is running for re-election and is considered one of the Senate’s most vulnerable incumbents. Sasse, who has at times criticized Trump but won his endorsement for re-election, said public officials nationwide “should be lowering the temperature” over protests and violence following the death in police custody of George Floyd, an unarmed black man, in Minnesota. Four Minneapolis police officers have been fired and one has been charged with murder in Floyd’s death. “Police injustice – like the evil murder of George Floyd – is repugnant and merits peaceful protest aimed at change,” Sasse said, adding that “riots are abhorrent acts of violence that hurt the innocent.” Both messages should be heard as Americans work to end violence and injustice, Sasse said. The comments by the three GOP senators were among the strongest by Republicans following Trump’s demand Monday to end the heated protests and his vow to use military force to achieve that if necessary. Republicans have frequently muted any criticism of Trump, and only GOP Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah voted in favor of Trump’s impeachment in February. After Trump’s hardline speech Monday in the White House Rose Garden, the president walked to nearby St. John’s Church, where he held up a Bible for photographers. Trump’s actions drew widespread condemnation from Democrats and religious leaders who said he was misusing the Bible and the church where presidents have prayed for more than 150 years. South Dakota Sen. John Thune, the second-ranking GOP senator, said that “as a general matter, I always think it’s a good thing for our elected leaders to be spending time at church.” Still, Thune said views of Trump’s actions were “going to be in the eye of the beholder. His supporters are going to think … he was standing up for the things he believes in and they believe in. His detractors are going to say it was a photo op.” Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, said Trump likely “thought this would be some unifying message, but of course it was for half the country, and the other half were outraged by it. And that’s just where we are, sadly.” On Trump’s threat to send in the military to quell violence, Cornyn and Thune said they hope Trump does not resort to that. While Trump “arguably” has the authority to use military force, “so far he hasn’t done it,” Cornyn said. “Hopefully, he won’t do it. It won’t be necessary. And we will try to bring some peace back to our communities.” Thune said he would “prefer that these things be handled by the state and local authorities. You want to de-escalate, rather than escalate.” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., declined to comment on Trump’s actions, but said he was relieved there were no deaths and few injuries in the nation’s capital Monday night. McConnell condemned rioting in his home city of Louisville and other cities, even as he said the nation is united in horror and opposition to Floyd’s death. “The legitimate and important voices of peaceful protesters will never be heard over the wailing of fire alarms, the smashing of plate-glass windows, and the sirens of ambulances coming for police officers who have been assaulted or shot in the head,” McConnell said. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said he was glad Trump went to a “historic church in our capital city that was firebombed by terrorists. It was important for the president to be there and say we will not be cowed by terrorists. All of us have a First Amendment right to speak, but you don’t have a right to burn a church.” Send questions/comments to the editors. « Previous Next »",0.0

What starts to hurt me is when you speak towards why we are angry and the systemic pieces of it, and statistics. And then you act on ways that compromises me more than you as an ally, that is when it gets scary for me,” Machar said.Machar condemned the vandalism that occurred during Monday night’s protest that led to the arrests of 23 people.“That does not represent us. Because that act had nothing to do with what we were trying to say nor did it come from our community or members of our community,” Machar said. “There are people in the crowd throwing bottles that were not part of the protest, part of the voice, but it's always going to be the black violence, because that is a stereotype. Again, that is why we are here. That is why we are in the streets to combat these narratives,” Machar said.The Rev.

By posting simple black squares on Instagram or in their profile pictures on Facebook, the two joined those using social media to participate in #blackouttuesday. Originally organized by the music community, the protest went mainstream as the hashtag became more popular. Brown and Severance said the low-key symbol appropriately reflected their somewhat uncomprehending but sincere support of a struggle against a form of oppression that they themselves don’t face. “As a white person I don’t think it is about me but I wanted to show solidarity,” Severance said Tuesday. “I just felt like I didn’t want to be silent, but it is hard to know what to say right now.” “I am not saying that I understand what they go through,” Brown said. “As a gay man I feel like I may have a small idea of the micro-aggressions and the stares they get, but other than that I’ll never truly understand.” Most of the postings were blank, though some posted #TheShowMustBePaused, black heart emojis or encouraged people to vote Tuesday since seven states and the District of Columbia are hosting the largest slate of primary elections in almost three months, according to the Associated Press. The online protests contrast with anti-racism rallies held in Bangor and Portland on Monday. Bangor’s was largely peaceful, while Portland’s devolved as the night went on, with police pushing back protesters on Franklin Street as some shoved and threw bottles at them. Portland police arrested 23 people overnight as burglaries and criminal mischief occurred at several businesses in the downtown areas, according to a spokesperson. Severance said he was surprised at the number of people posting black squares on social media. “I felt like I woke up this morning and my feed was just full of it,” he said. Brown said the protests highlighted an awareness of the racial disparities in the U.S. “We are all dealing with the same storm but we are not on the same ship,” Brown said. The online protests haven’t been without problems. CNN reported that posting the blank black image with a bunch of tags clogs up critical channels of information and updates. Groups or businesses posting the black square on Twitter included Maine Soccer, Maine’s organization of youth soccer leagues; Cancer Action Network Maine; Maine Maritime Academy’s football boosters; and Coastal Enterprises Inc.",0.0

It was an unusual, but not unprecedented, moment for the Queen City, which does not generally see as many large political demonstrations as two of its counterparts to the south, Augusta and Portland. The event started with a large, peaceful gathering next to the Bangor Public Library that drew an estimated 500-600 people, according to the Bangor Police Department. Afterward, demonstrators marched up Main Street to a park across from the police department. Then, a smaller group of protesters broke off and spent time rallying in front of the police station. “They’re really not that common here,” local historian Richard Shaw said of large political gatherings. “But when they happen, they are very heartfelt.” The turnout on Monday night may have been even higher if it weren’t for the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, said Sue McKay, 65, a longtime Bangor resident who attended the protest and has experience organizing demonstrations for another man, Charlie Howard, whose 1984 murder in Bangor helped accelerate the state’s LGBTQ rights movement. “I personally know a number of friends who would have gone if not fearful for their health,” she said. “I think it’s really extraordinary that you had that kind of turnout under these conditions.” She added that she was “very impressed” how many rally goers wore face masks and kept a safe distance from others. Estimating crowd sizes is an inexact science, but just a few other Bangor demonstrations of the past few decades have surpassed the size of Monday night’s, according to the available record. Natalie Williams | BDN Natalie Williams | BDN Most recently, more than 1,000 activists marched through downtown Bangor in January 2018 to commemorate the Women’s March one year earlier against the policies of President Donald Trump. A dozen years before that, roughly 1,500 people gathered on the Bangor waterfront to call for an end to the Iraq War. In October 1998, an estimated 800 people rallied for an expansion of LGBTQ rights in Cascade Park after a smaller number marched 10 miles through the rain from Orono. There have been less spontaneous events that have drawn big crowds, such as rallies by political candidates including Trump. And the city’s annual LGTBQ Pride Parade grew to its biggest size ever last year, with between 2,500 and 3,000 attendees. But in general, demonstrations have rarely topped 200. About 150 people went to an Occupy Bangor protest in 2011, and 100 went to a rally to protect the Penobscot River in 2017. Annual memorials for Howard now generally attract between 30 and 40 participants, according to McKay, a member of the Unitarian Universalist Society of Bangor that organizes those events. Natalie Williams | BDN Natalie Williams | BDN It’s far more common to see smaller demonstrations of five, 10 or 20 people on street corners or outside the offices of Maine’s congressional delegation. Historically, Greater Bangor has hosted some other larger demonstrations around galvanizing national events such as Floyd’s death, according to Shaw. In 1965, some local faith leaders helped organize a march downtown following assaults on civil rights activists in Selma, Alabama. Between the late 1800s and early 1900s, members of the Temperance Movement also held multiple demonstrations. “There are a lot of people of conscience around here who really care about things,” Shaw said. “A lot of churches, a lot of people who are very much in tune with the sensibilities of something that might have happened far away. They can’t probably visit the scene of the crime, but they can be on TV and make a statement.” Watch: Hundreds protest George Floyd’s death outside police department",0.0

Democratic U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree of Maine’s 1st District, who agreed to an interview, said the right to protest is guaranteed by the Constitution, and that President Donald Trump’s use of an 1807 law to authorize military action against protests is improper. Pingree said the Insurrection Act was intended to give presidents a tool to put down a revolution, not to clear a site for a photo opportunity. “As he is saying, ‘I stand with peaceful protestors,’ he has military forces across the street in a park where people traditionally protest. They are doing so in a peaceful way before the curfew comes into D.C. and he is gassing them to get them out of the park,” she said. Pingree said the president ordered demonstrators be dispersed so that he could hold a photo-op in front of a church that had been damaged in an earlier protest. She said she fears that his planned trip Friday to Guilford, where swabs used in COVID-19 tests are made, is just part of his reelection effort. “If he was coming here to bring a message of unity, and talking about the challenging times in our country and how to bring people forward instead of doing what it appears like it will be — an attempt to have a political rally in the 2nd Congressional District,” she said. Trump won the district in 2016, getting its single electoral vote. Republican U.S. Sen. Susan Collins of Maine gave a speech in the Senate Monday on the importance of the right to peaceably protest, underscoring its constitutional protection. She said in an interview late Tuesday that the president should be trying to calm the situation. “I don’t think it was the right thing to do for the president to stage this event last night in the midst of these peaceful protests,” she said. Collins said she was upset to watch the use of military force to clear the area so the president could hold his photo-op. As for his visit to Maine, she said the governor has made it clear the visit poses a security risk, but does not know if the president will listen to her concerns. Independent U.S. Sen. Angus King of Maine declined an interview request, his spokesperson said. “Sen. King is yielding airtime and attention to the voices in the hotspots who deserve to be heard at this point, and sharing his thoughts primarily via social media right now,” the spokesperson said. King was critical of Trump in several tweets, saying, “his callous use of a church and the Christian Bible as props in a political stunt which demeaned people of faith, degraded the office of the presidency, and insulted the American people.” Democratic U.S. Rep. Jared Golden of Maine’s 2nd District did not respond to a request for an interview. He did issue a statement Monday supporting the right of all Americans to peaceably protest.",0.0

The president’s trip seems to have been quickly arranged. Gov. Janet Mills said she learned about it on Sunday. It was confirmed by the White House on Monday after an exchange between the president and Mills leaked from a testy call with governors over the response to protests across the country. The event is likely to pull large amounts of law enforcement officers from their regular duties to help protect Trump and his route. A protest scheduled outside the event could pose more security challenges. Details of the trip have not been confirmed. Trump is likely to land Air Force One at the Bangor International Airport on Friday, though an airport spokesperson said she could not confirm that. The president is likely to travel to Guilford on Marine One, his helicopter. On Tuesday, videos posted to social media showed government helicopters taking off and landing at Piscataquis Community High School. Kathie Summers-Grice, a Republican operative who helped plan roughly two dozen visits to Maine by former President George W. Bush while she was working in his administration or on associated campaigns, said she had never worked on a presidential visit to Maine with such a long transfer from airport to event, but said it would “suck up a lot of community resources.” The Secret Service may have to establish command posts in Bangor and Guilford to manage logistics, she said. There are then the costs of getting all vehicles and necessary aircraft to Maine while coordinating with local officials while securing airspace as Trump lands in Bangor and makes the transfer to Guilford. “It makes it very tricky because you’re going to have to secure that route and that takes a lot of time and resources,” Summers-Grice said. Four trips by Trump to his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida over the course of just over a month in 2017 cost federal agencies $13.6 million, according to a review last year by the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office. Most went toward operating government aircraft and boats with $3 million to supporting expenses including transportation, lodging and meals. The Secret Service and White House perform days and sometimes weeks of security and logistics work to prepare a location for the president’s arrival. Maine State Police spokesperson Stephen McCausland said the agency began planning for the trip on Monday. He would not say how many troopers will be involved in the event. Ernie Clark | BDN Ernie Clark | BDN The White House did not answer logistical questions on Tuesday and a spokesperson for Puritan Medical Products, the host of the event and one of the two largest worldwide manufacturers of medical swabs used to test for the coronavirus, did not respond to a request for comment. There were no signs of an increased security presence at the facility on Tuesday morning. Piscataquis County Sheriff Bob Young, who is coordinating the local and county law enforcement response, said he is working with Penobscot County and 14 of the state’s 16 sheriffs have agreed to send deputies to help out. Route planning and itineraries will be coordinated by the Secret Service, Young said. The federal government does not reimburse local agencies for helping the Secret Service protect the president as a rule. Congress set aside $61 million in 2017 to reimburse New York City and Palm Beach, Florida — where Trump has homes — for frequent security expenses. That could cause grief for responding agencies. Piscataquis County manager Michael Williams said commissioners “don’t like to see a lot of fluff in the budget” and try to be conservative. The announcement of the president’s visit to Guilford came amid growing unrest in Maine and nationwide after the police killing of George Floyd, a black man in Minneapolis. A rally in Portland on Monday night led to 23 arrests after weekend protests remained peaceful. Organizers are planning a Black Lives Matter rally in Guilford corresponding with the Friday visit. Young, the sheriff, wrote on Facebook that he planned to protect the right to assemble while asking protesters and anyone opposed to them to remain peaceful. Dover-Foxcroft police Chief Ryan Reardon said reports on social media of people coming from out of town or outside the state could ratchet up stress on police and the small town where only certain officers are trained to handle protests. “You wouldn’t throw someone into a situation they’re not prepared to handle,” he said.

1623718336,2020-06-02 18:51:22,Protests in top 25 virus hot spots ignite fears of contagion,https://www.pressherald.com/2020/06/02/protests-in-top-25-virus-hot-spots-ignite-fears-of-contagion/,en,False,,366984,pressherald.com,http://pressherald.com/,"PROVIDENCE, R.I. — As demonstrators flooded streets across America to decry the killing of George Floyd, public health experts watched in alarm – the close proximity of protesters and their failures in many cases to wear masks, along with the police using tear gas, could fuel new transmissions of the coronavirus. Many of the protests broke out in places where the virus is still circulating widely in the population. In fact, an Associated Press review found that demonstrations have taken place in every one of the 25 U.S. communities with the highest concentrations of new cases. Some have seen major protests over multiple days, including Minneapolis-St. Paul, Chicago, Washington, D.C., and Los Angeles. The protests have come just as communities across the nation loosen restrictions on businesses and public life that have helped slow the spread of the virus, deepening concern that the two factors taken together could create a national resurgence in cases. “As a nation, we have to be concerned about a rebound,” Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser warned Sunday after days of protests rocked the nation’s capital. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo bemoaned the crowds, saying that hundreds could potentially have been infected, undoing months of social distancing. A fresh outbreak in the places where protesters gathered could lead to reinstituting shutdowns. The AP’s review focused on large metro counties – the central counties within metro areas with more than 1 million people – that showed the highest rates of new cases per capita over the past 14 days. While case numbers and deaths have been trending down in several of the cities where the largest protests have occurred, the number of people in those places infected with the virus – and with the ability to spread it – remains high. And in some of the communities, such as Minneapolis, the number of people hospitalized with COVID-19 has been rising. Floyd died May 25 after a Minneapolis police officer pressed a knee into his neck for several minutes, even as he pleaded that he couldn’t breathe. Minneapolis has been ground zero for the sprawling protests, which have crossed the Mississippi River into neighboring St. Paul. The unrest has coincided with “the very worst days of the pandemic so far” in the Twin Cities metropolitan area, said Michael T. Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota. “Our ICU bed care is at its all-time high and is really on the edge,” he said. Ramsey and Hennepin counties, home to the Twin Cities, ranked seventh and eighth for the highest per capita new cases in the AP analysis. Each has seen more than 250 cases per 100,000 population in the past two weeks, together reporting nearly 2,000 new cases in the last week alone. Experts point out that other factors associated with protests could accelerate the spread of the virus. For instance, tear gas can cause people to cough and sneeze, as can the smoke from fires set by people bent on destruction. And both also prompt protesters to remove their masks. Crowding protesters who have been arrested into jail cells can also increase the risk of contagion. An AP tally found that, thus far, more than 5,600 people have been taken into custody. Protesters and police shouting at one another nose-to-nose also is raising alarms. Osterholm and other public health experts note, however, that the protests aren’t necessarily as alarming as other events that could fuel new cases because they take place outside and many people are wearing masks. In some cases, hand sanitizer also is being informally distributed. And Dr. David Eisenman, director of the Center for Public Health and Disasters at the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health, said he feared partisan forces might accuse cities of bringing fresh cases on themselves. “I’m actually more worried about how, if those spikes occur, how that information will be weaponized against the notion of protests,” he said. Eisenman called protesting an “essential activity,” possible to practice with reduced risk. He said his grown children protested in Los Angeles and are taking safety precautions now, including isolating themselves at home. They plan to get tested for COVID-19 in about a week. Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician and public health professor at George Washington University, said the hospitalizations for coronavirus in the Washington metro area have been on the decline but that she knows that could change. “There are a lot of unknowns about what happens next,” she said. Wen was the health commissioner for the city of Baltimore during the 2015 uprising after the death of Freddie Gray in police custody and said many health clinics were closed and pharmacies burned down, making it difficult for members of disadvantaged communities to access health care. It’s a concern for her now, too. “You will have compounded health issues that go beyond COVID-19,” she said. Public health experts said it will take two to three weeks to know whether the protests cause a surge in coronavirus cases. And even then, they can’t definitively tie it to the demonstrations. The unrest is happening in tandem with the reopening of gyms, hair salons, restaurants, parks and beaches. It also comes on the heels of the Memorial Day weekend, when many people attended large gatherings, so experts already were bracing for a case increase, said Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins University. In Los Angeles, barbershops and in-person dining were allowed to resume last weekend, just as protests descended into destruction and more than 1,000 people were arrested. Nearly 10,000 new cases have been reported in Los Angeles County in the past week. Hundreds of people also were arrested in Chicago, where Cook County has had among the highest per capita rates of new cases of any large county in the nation, with 283 new cases per 100,000 population in the past two weeks. “The absolute number of cases is still high. We feel good about the fact that we’ve established a decreasing incidence, but we have a ways to go,” said Dr. Ronald Hershow the director of the Division of Epidemiology and Biostatistics at the University of Illinois-Chicago. Hershow and others noted that the racial disparities laid bare by coronavirus — with communities of color bearing a disproportionate burden of infections and deaths — overlap with the issues being protested on streets across America and around the globe. “Racism kills,” Hershow said. “Sometimes that’s direct, as in the case of George Floyd. And sometimes it’s through a virus like COVID-19.” Send questions/comments to the editors. « Previous Next » filed under:",0.0

Boston players including Jaylen Brown, Marcus Smart, Enes Kanter and Vincent Poirier have been among several NBA players to participate in recent protests following the death of George Floyd, a black man who died in Minneapolis last month after a white police officer pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck as he begged for air. Demonstrations have taken place in cities around the country in response to the incident, which was captured in a widely seen video that has mobilized protesters. A medical examiner ruled Monday that Floyd’s heart stopped as police restrained him and compressed his neck. It all prompted Stevens to write a letter to his players over the weekend in which he expressed his support for them. “I think the thing that I wanted them to know is that every decent person is hurting,” Stevens said in a conference call with reporters Tuesday. “Every decent person feels the pain of the African American community. But I also don’t want to pretend like I know the exact, distinct pain. So what I wanted them to know is that I’m with them.” The Celtics were among several professional sports teams to issue statements in the aftermath of Floyd’s death, saying in part that it and other similar incidents “have left the entire Celtics organization struggling with grief and anger.” The resulting national dialogue has reminded Stevens of the discussions he had with players prior to the 2016-17 season during the height of Colin Kaepernick’s protests when he took a knee during the national anthem prior to NFL games to protest police brutality. Stevens said those protests prompted players to share their own experiences with racial profiling and discrimination. Brown, who grew up outside of Atlanta, drove 15 hours from Boston to lead a march in Atlanta on Sunday. It’s the kind of action Steven has come to expect from the 23-year-old. “I’m not surprised with him taking a leadership role,” Stevens said. “That’s who he is.” Floyd’s death and the resulting demonstrations come at a time during which NBA leadership is trying to formulate a plan to possibly resume the season amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Stevens said the proposals are promising, but that most talk about basketball has taken a backseat in recent days. Several Celtics players did begin to take part in voluntary, individual workouts at the team’s practice facility Monday. The team is also having regular meetings via video conferencing. But Stevens said they have mostly been focusing on the mental well-being of athletes since the start of the pandemic and that’s continued during the demonstrations.

Few new details emerged Tuesday about Trump’s planned tour of the Puritan Medical Products facility that produces swabs used in coronavirus tests. The White House did not release additional information, and the office of Gov. Janet Mills did not respond to several requests for comment or make Mills available for an interview, one day after she raised security concerns about the presidential visit at a time of violent protests and political unrest nationwide. Piscataquis County Sheriff Robert Young, however, said in a post on Facebook that he hopes “folks will let the employees of Hardwood Products/Puritan Medical Products have their moment of recognition, as the President, on behalf of the nation, expresses our collective thanks.” “In ordinary times, a Presidential visit to Guilford, Maine would be a great thing, regardless of who the President is,” Young wrote. “Sadly, at this time, our nation is so full of strife and rancor, that the good nature of his coming is overshadowed by the politics of our time.” Trump’s trip to Guilford on Friday is the latest in a series of visits to U.S. manufacturers producing protective gear, testing equipment and medical supplies during the coronavirus pandemic. Puritan Medical Products received a $75.5 million federal grant to double its swab production – from 20 million to 40 million units monthly – to help expand COVID-19 testing capacity nationwide. At least one rally, dubbed a “Guilford, Maine Peaceful Protest for Black Lives Matter” was being promoted on Facebook and had drawn “interest” from more than 1,700 people as of Tuesday evening. Organizers of the event did not respond to messages seeking to be interviews about the event. The president’s supporters, meanwhile, were using social media to urge others to “to line every street he drives on.” Young wrote that he has been in contact with the protest organizers and “their motives and intent are good, they want to speak for social change and are heartbroken by what they see happening to their country.” “They desire the protest to be peaceful, and I believe they will do all they can to keep it so,” Young said. “I’m asking those who oppose the protest to do so peacefully as well. Violence generally begets violence, and is never going to solve the issues of our land.” Young also expressed shock and dismay at the Minneapolis police officer’s actions, adding that, “In Piscataquis County we don’t use those tactics.” Young declined to comment beyond his Facebook post. The nation has been on edge since video emerged of a Minneapolis police officer kneeling on the neck of a black man, George Floyd, who had been detained on minor charges. Floyd repeatedly told the officers that he couldn’t breathe before losing consciousness and dying. That officer has since been charged with murder. While the majority of ensuing protests nationwide have been peaceful, some have turned violent as police clashed with rioters damaged properties and looted businesses. Those mass gatherings come at a time when the nation is in the midst of a highly infectious viral pandemic that has killed more than 100,000 people. Portland police dressed in riot gear and using pepper spray arrested 23 people late Monday night and early Tuesday morning after hundreds of protesters refused to disperse. Trump’s words and actions Monday night heightened tensions as he threatened to send the military units into states and then staged a photo op outside of a church near the White House moments after law enforcement used tear gas and flash grenades to clear a crowd of peaceful protesters. On Monday evening Mills expressed concerns about Trump’s planned visit to Maine following an earlier conference calls in which he accused governors of being “weak” on violent protests and urged them to use force to “dominate” the streets. “I ask that when you arrive here, you rise above the language that I heard this morning,” Mills said. “I ask that you check the rhetoric at the door and abandon the divisive language that sows the seeds of distrust among our people.” Mills made those comments roughly 90 minutes before television networks broadcast live images of officers aggressively clearing the park in front of the White House. Mills’ office did not respond to comments Tuesday about the president’s vow to send the military into states that failed to quell violent protests. This will be Trump’s first visit to Maine since taking office in 2017, but it might not be his last this year. Some critics view the trip as a campaign event as his supporters attempt to repeat his 2016 performance when he picked up one of Maine’s four Electoral College votes by winning the 2nd Congressional District. Dover-Foxcroft Police Chief Ryan Reardon said it was clear to him that Floyd was “murdered” by the officer in Minneapolis and should have been arrested immediately. Reardon added that he believes “every law enforcement officer in Piscataquis County agrees with the sentiment.” But Reardon, whose officers will likely be called upon to assist with security on Friday, said for any U.S. president to come to Guilford — located in one of the poorest counties east of the Mississippi River — is “kind of a big deal.” So Reardon said he hopes others who come to town Friday will “express your opinion, but do it peacefully” while allowing the larger focus to be on Puritan employees’ vital contribution to the nation’s coronavirus response. “I’m really hoping this is a peaceful gathering and a peaceful event, that the president can tour this very nice facility and let the people have pride in their jobs,” Reardon said.

1623735445,2020-06-02 19:36:38,D.C. officials push back on aggressive response to protests,https://www.pressherald.com/2020/06/02/d-c-officials-push-back-on-aggressive-response-to-protests/,en,False,,366984,pressherald.com,http://pressherald.com/,"WASHINGTON — Officials in the nation’s capital pushed back Tuesday on an aggressive response by the federal government to demonstrations over the death of George Floyd, with the mayor flatly rejecting a Trump administration proposal for the federal government to take over its police force and one county in Virginia pulling its officers from Washington. The federal government has deployed law enforcement officials from numerous agencies, and National Guard troops from a number of states have been sent to the District of Columbia. Attorney General William Barr, who is directing the federal law enforcement response in the city, promised by Tuesday “even greater law enforcement resources and support in the region.” District of Columbia Mayor Muriel Bowser said the Trump administration floated the idea of taking over the Metropolitan Police Department, a proposal she strongly rejected. She threatened to take legal action if the federal government attempted to do so. But there were signs that the federal response would be even more aggressive Tuesday night, as Washington prepared for a fifth night of protests. Hours before a 7 p.m. curfew for the second night in a row, cars were being stopped at military checkpoints in downtown Washington and a cavalry of armored military vehicles could be seen driving through the district. Businesses were boarding up windows with plywood in anticipation of another night of violence after fires were set, windows were shattered, store shelves were emptied and dozens of police officers were injured in days of protests. Two Defense Department officials said the Trump administration had ordered military aircraft to fly above Washington on Monday night as a “show of force” against demonstrators protesting the death of Floyd, a black man who died after a white Minneapolis policeman pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes even after Floyd stopped moving and pleading for air. Police made over 300 arrests, mainly for violating the district’s curfew. Earlier Monday evening, law enforcement officers on foot and horseback moved aggressively to clear protesters away from Lafayette Park near the White House in advance of President Trump’s walk to a nearby church for a photo opportunity. After participating in the show of force, Arlington County in Virginia pulled out its officers, saying they were used “for a purpose not worthy of our mutual aid obligations.” County Board Chair Libby Garvey said on Twitter she’s “appalled” that the mutual aid agreement was abused “for a photo op.” In a phone interview, Garvey said the aid request came from U.S. Park Police, and that the agencies have aided each other routinely over the years. She said Arlington Police had helped in Washington on Saturday and Sunday without incident. Arlington County officials said in a statement their officers never wielded their batons and did not fire rubber bullets or tear gas. But after watching the scene unfold on live television, the police chief ordered all the officers to return to Virginia. “This unprecedented decision by the County was a necessary response to an unprecedented situation,” the statement said. Officials said they were re-evaluating the mutual aid agreements to ensure officers “are never again put in a situation where they are asked to take action that is inconsistent with our values.” The U.S. Park Police on Tuesday defended its actions at the park, saying it issued three warnings over a loudspeaker before clearing the area of protesters, some of whom they said were becoming violent, throwing projectiles and trying to grab weapons. It said it used smoke canisters and pepper balls to disperse the crowd. Barr ordered law enforcement officials to clear the park and push back the perimeter around the White House when he arrived there Monday evening, ahead of the president’s remarks, leading to police using force to disperse protesters, a person familiar with the matter told the AP. Officials had met Monday morning and decided the perimeter had to be moved by at least one full block, which was expected to happen by Monday afternoon, after multiple fires were set in the park the night before, the person said. When Barr arrived, he was surprised it hadn’t been done and directed action to be taken, according to the person, who could not discuss the matter publicly and spoke to AP on condition of anonymity. Monday, in a call with governors, Trump and Barr had encouraged more aggressive action against those who cause violence during protests across the country. The call raised questions about whether using more aggressive law enforcement measures against demonstrators protesting police brutality would only increase tensions. Trump said he was “taking immediate presidential action to stop the violence and restore security and safety in America.” The president urged governors to deploy the National Guard, which he credited with helping calm the situation Sunday night in Minneapolis, and demanded that similarly tough measures be taken in cities that also experienced spasms of violence, including New York, Philadelphia and Los Angeles. “Mayors and governors must establish an overwhelming law enforcement presence until the violence has been quelled,” Trump said. Between the protests and the response to the coronavirus pandemic, the National Guard has been deployed at its highest level in recent history, surpassing the number of troops sent to the Gulf Coast during Hurricane Katrina in 2005. More than 66,700 soldiers and airman have been activated — 45,000 to assist with the pandemic and more than 17,000 to help with the protests. The federal government has provided all affected states with a list of National Guard resources available to them, a White House official said. The official added that Trump’s message to governors was if they don’t utilize all of the tools in their arsenal they shouldn’t expect a sympathetic response from Washington if they request federal dollars to help with clean-up and recovery down the line. The official could not discuss the matter publicly and spoke to AP on condition of anonymity. Other law enforcement resources are also being mobilized in Washington. The Justice Department had deployed agents from every one of its agencies, including the FBI’s Hostage Rescue Team, an elite tactical unit, and riot teams from the Bureau of Prisons. The U.S. Park Police and Secret Service have had dozens of officers out in riot gear in Washington for the last few nights, in addition to the Metropolitan Police Department. U.S. Customs and Border Protection and other Homeland Security agencies were also dispatched. Most of the protesters have been peaceful and tried to discourage violence. Trump, Barr and others have tried to blame some of the civil unrest on left-wing extremist groups, including antifa, and other “anarchists.” Short for anti-fascists, antifa is an umbrella term for far-left-leaning militant groups that resist neo-Nazis and white supremacists at demonstrations. The Justice Department has vowed to treat the “violence instigated and carried out by antifa & other similar groups” as domestic terrorism. Although there isn’t a specific federal domestic terrorism statute, prosecutors could charge other offenses and seek enhanced sentencing. The U.S. military and National Guard are operating in Washington under the official mission name Operation Themis, according to two Pentagon officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to do so publicly. In Greek mythology, Themis was a titaness of divine law and order, whose symbols are the scales of justice. Army Lt. Col. Chris Mitchell, a Pentagon spokesperson, said they were not aware of the operational name but said it’s possible. Send questions/comments to the editors. « Previous Next »",0.0
1623735442,2020-06-02 19:39:25,Protesters converge on Portland police station as demonstrations continue after black man’s killing,https://www.pressherald.com/2020/06/02/protesters-converge-on-police-station-for-fourth-day/,en,False,,366984,pressherald.com,http://pressherald.com/,"More than 1,000 demonstrators protesting police violence against people of color once again flooded Portland’s streets on Tuesday night, marching to different areas of the Old Port and the Eastern Prom for the fourth time in five days to express their outrage over the death of a Minnesota man in police custody. Unlike Monday’s protest, which was marred by arrests, burglary and vandalism, Tuesday’s demonstration was mostly peaceful with the highlight coming after Portland Police Chief Frank Clark and Portland City Manager Jon Jennings took a knee in solidarity with protesters on the steps of the police station. The protest started with about 300 people in Monument Square on Congress Street, where an organizer mentioned the previous night’s protests when violence and vandalism flared – resulting in the arrests of 23 people – and asked participants to avoid a similar situation Tuesday night. The woman, identified only as Mary, urged people to be peaceful, saying, “Yesterday was beautiful, but it didn’t end well, let’s do this right” referring to the arrests and vandalism that marred Monday’s protest. The procession of demonstrators then walked to the Portland Police Station on Middle Street where they were met by Clark and Jennings. After one speaker told the crowd that police officers needed to be trained to be more understanding and compassionate toward people of color, the crowd, which had swelled to about 500 people marched to the Eastern Prom where they staged a die-in, lying on their stomachs with their hands behind their backs while chanting, “I can’t breathe.” Those were the words George Floyd uttered as a former Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck until he lost consciousness and stopped breathing. The dramatic demonstration on the Eastern Prom lasted for about 9 minutes, roughly the same amount of time that former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin pressed down on Floyd’s neck with his knee while three other officers looked on. The situation in Portland Tuesday night became tense at times, with anti-protesters carrying American flags and one white man shouting expletives at a group of black men. Police wearing riot gear assembled at Pearl and Middle streets after a group of seven men dressed in orange hunting vests and carrying American flags began to agitate protesters. The men carried signs that said they supported police. Maine State Police and members of the Cumberland County Sheriff’s Office – the squads were dressed in riot gear – then marched down Pearl Street and stood nearby as a Portland police officer talked to the men. The group left peacefully and were not seen again. An officer was spotted on the rooftop of the Hampton Inn, leading to postings on social media about the possibility of a police sniper, a scenario dismissed by Portland Police spokesman Lt. Robert Martin. He was not certain how law enforcement resources were deployed Tuesday night, but said the officer was most likely an observer positioned to gain a better vantage point. Martin added that people shouldn’t jump to conclusions that the officer was carrying a weapon, saying he could have been using some type of observation device. By the time the demonstrators reached the Eastern Prom, the size of the crowd had grown to about 1,000 people. The protesters marched from the Eastern Prom down Congress Street to Congress Square, where organizers thanked everyone for what appeared to have been a largely peaceful demonstration. At around 8:45 p.m., organizers using a bullhorn urged everyone to “go home safe.” But at 10:15 p.m. a group of about 100 protesters reformed outside the police station and began setting off fireworks as police in riot gear lined up across Franklin Arterial and fired rubber bullets at protesters who threw bottles. Just before 11:30 police asked people to disperse and began advancing their line down Franklin Arterial, making a few arrests as they went. The outburst of violence mirrored events on Monday night, when over 1,000 protesters amassed outside the police station and engaged in a confrontation with police that moved around the downtown area and lasted until nearly 2 a.m. Officers from 15 other police departments joined Portland police and stood shoulder-to-shoulder carrying wooden batons and plastic riot shields. Everyone arrested during the demonstration posted bail by Tuesday morning, said Martin, the police spokesman. All but one person was charged with failure to disperse, a misdemeanor. One man, the driver of a tractor-trailer that entered the protest area near the intersection of Middle Street and Franklin Arterial, was charged with reckless conduct with dangerous weapon, a Class C felony. Throughout Monday night, there was a push and pull between organizers who sought to keep the demonstrations peaceful, and people who threw water bottles and other objects at the police, destroyed property and defaced businesses. At one point, some police knelt with protesters, drawing cheers from the crowd. Others talked with protesters from the police line, but most officers remained silent or did not react or engage. Protest organizers finally got a meeting with Chief Frank Clark on Tuesday after two days of trying. Hamdia Ahmed and Abdul Ali, who organized a protest on Friday and are planning a demonstration Wednesday outside the Portland police station, met via Zoom with Clark, Westbrook Police Chief Janine Roberts, and city and state leaders to discuss issues of race and policing, and the broad, overarching issue of police treatment of black and brown people across the country, Clark said. The problems are systemic, Ahmed said, according to Clark, and she did not single out the Portland department. “We did a lot of listening,” Clark said. “They articulated that they wanted to be heard. They wanted us to hear them. We vowed to continue the conversations.” Another organizer who planned the protest that became violent Monday has been communicating with city officials, as well. Protests have roiled the nation since the death of Floyd, 46, on May 25. Chauvin, the former officer, has been charged with murder in the death and the three officers who were with him were fired but have not been charged. After days of demonstrations, protesters undeterred by curfews coursed back into the nation’s streets Tuesday, hours after President Trump pressed governors to put down the violence set off by Floyd’s death and demanded that New York call up the National Guard to stop the “lowlifes and losers.” As more demonstrations began taking shape around the country, and cities including Washington prepared for another possible round of scattered violence after dark, the president amplified his hard-line calls of a day earlier, in which he threatened to send in the military to restore order if governors didn’t do it. Clark had released a statement Tuesday afternoon in which he expressed disgust at Floyd’s killing, but said a small segment of the demonstrators were determined to cause trouble, leading to the harsher response by officers. “Our goal remains providing a safe environment for those wishing to peacefully express their views and First Amendment rights,” Clark said in the statement. “We are fortunate that no one was seriously injured and that most of the property damage was minimal. Unfortunately, a committed smaller segment of this group ended up making this event anything other than a peaceful and lawful protest. They took the opportunity to commit acts of violence, damage public and private property and place my officers and the public at risk. We will not stand for such criminal behavior.” Send questions/comments to the editors. « Previous Next »",0.0
1623736580,2020-06-02 17:56:47,Portland chief meets with protest organizers as demonstrations continue,https://www.centralmaine.com/2020/06/02/portland-chief-meets-with-protest-organizers-as-demonstrations-continue/,en,False,,29592,onlinesentinel.com,http://www.onlinesentinel.com#spider,"City officials Tuesday spoke with the leaders of two groups that have brought more than 1,000 demonstrators into Portland’s streets over the past four days to protest racism and police brutality. Portland’s police chief, city manager and mayor, along with other state and local officials, met virtually on Tuesday with two organizers of the downtown protests to listen to concerns that have fueled angry marches around the country. Officials also made contact with a third organizer, whose rally Monday night turned destructive and confrontational and led to a prolonged clash with police that lasted into Tuesday morning. The meetings and phone calls represent a game of catch-up for city officials, who had been trying to make contact with organizers since Friday, City Manager Jon Jennings said. Part of the delay stems from the shutdown of city government in response to the coronavirus pandemic, he said, and the organic nature of the demonstrations themselves. “What happened in Minnesota was beyond outrageous,” Jennings said. “So we understand the anger that’s in the community. So, in the beginning we’ve wanted to work cooperatively with them but we didn’t really know who the organizers were.” Jennings said typically when groups want to demonstrate, they can communicate with city officials. But the COVID-19 response has led to furloughs, including of the permitting staff who typically handle requests for police and city assistance during demonstrations. That left the city without a clear idea of logistics or what to expect. Hamdia Ahmed and Abdul Ali, who organized a protest on Friday and are now planning a demonstration Wednesday outside the Portland police station, met via a Zoom meeting with city leaders to discuss issues of race and policing, and the broad, overarching issue of police treatment of black and brown people across the country, Police Chief Frank Clark said. The problems are systemic, Ahmed said, and she did not single out the Portland department, according to Clark. Other participants in the meeting were Portland Mayor Kate Snyder, Maine Commissioner of Public Safety Michael Sauschuck, Cumberland County District Attorney Jonathan Sahrbeck, Westbrook Police Chief Janine Roberts, Portland City Councilor Pious Ali and representatives of the Portland school department, said Jessica Grondin, a city spokeswoman. “We did a lot of listening,” Clark said. “They articulated that they wanted to be heard. They wanted us to hear them. We vowed to continue the conversations.” Ahmed told the police leaders they wanted the protests to be peaceful, Clark said. Reached Tuesday, Ahmed declined to speak to a reporter. Jennings, the city manager, has also kept in contact with another organizer, David Thete, who put together the demonstration on Monday evening that drew an estimated 1,000 protesters and later turned violent and confrontational. Jennings said he is working to get Clark and Thete to meet, and to arrange for Clark to speak to demonstrators at some point, but it was unclear whether he would do so Tuesday night or at some point in the future. Thete’s group has sought since Friday to place a memorial on the steps leading to the Portland Police station dedicated to all people of color killed by police, but repeatedly that memorial has been moved or taken down after demonstrations subside. On Tuesday, Jennings reached a compromise. Signs, candles and other mementos will be moved away from the staircase so they don’t block the staircase. Jennings also addressed police and protester conduct at the Monday rally, and blamed agitators from out of state for causing trouble. “The police were not antagonistic until it began to spiral out of control, meaning there were rocks in socks being flung, bottles of urine being thrown at officers, bricks being thrown at officers,” Jennings said. “At some point you have to take matters into your hands to restore public order. The folks who were causing the problems last night were not part of the people (demonstrating), they were coming from all over New England, from Massachusetts.” Asked how he knew the home community of some of the roughly 1,000 people who crammed the streets, he at first said the city has “sources and methods.” He said police, to his knowledge, are not monitoring cell phone traffic, but instead are monitoring social media. “Do you have SnapChat?” Jennings said. Different groups of demonstrators have gathered by the hundreds in downtown Portland since last Friday, as similar and sometimes more violent protests erupted in cities across the country. Ahmed organized a demonstration last Friday in which hundreds of people blocked traffic along Franklin Street and at Congress Square Park near High and Congress streets. Thete’s demonstration – also last Friday – saw hundreds of other demonstrators march on City Hall and the police station on Middle Street. Thete’s group returned Sunday, and demonstrators demanded to meet with Clark. Clark did not address a crowd of protesters who gathered outside the police station Sunday. On Monday, he said he reached out to organizers to arrange a meeting or meetings. Requests for an interview with Thete left through social media were not returned Monday or Tuesday, and Ahmed said Tuesday afternoon she would release a statement regarding Clark’s offer, and declined to speak on the phone. Clark on Tuesday said he is viewing the confrontation and the escalation that occurred Monday as an anomaly. “We certainly won’t condone breaking the law and the destruction of property,” Clark said. “But we’re literally going into this as a new day, and hope we see the level of cooperation we had (last) Friday and we’re going to ask people and plead with people to work with us in that regard.” Clark has made several statements condemning Floyd’s death, but has not directly called the incident murder as some police officials in other cities have. Other city officials have spoken about Floyd’s death and the demonstrations, which have taken place in hundreds of cities across the country and drawn millions of participants demanding racial justice and police reform. Portland’s City Council passed a resolution Monday condemning the recent killings of unarmed black men in other states and “all forms of racism and police brutality.” The resolution says city leaders pledge to protect the rights of all people and commits to “calling out hate and discrimination when we see it.” Mayor Kate Snyder spoke in support of the council’s proclamation condemning racism and police brutality, and has posted messages on Facebook condemning the killing of Floyd and supporting the peaceful protests. In a video posted on Facebook Monday, Snyder says she was outraged, stunned, sad and left speechless by Floyd’s death.

Brunswick Police Cmdr. Mark Waltz said he has had dozens of “very insightful” conversations over the past few days, and the department hopes to involve some of the protesters in training exercises with officers. Others expressed interest in a larger, townwide meeting. However, with limits on social gatherings during the coronavirus pandemic, Waltz said that was not immediately possible, but “we absolutely get the message and are willing to talk.” Hundreds gathered Sunday on the Brunswick downtown mall before marching to the police station, in protest of police brutality following the death of George Floyd, a black man in Minnesota who was killed last week by a white police officer. The Minneapolis officer, Derek Chauvin, knelt on Floyd’s neck for almost nine minutes, despite Floyd’s cries that he could not breathe. The video of Floyd’s death, coupled with heightened tensions over a series of other racial and police-related deaths in recent few months, has sparked outrage and protests across country. “Tensions everywhere are like a tinderbox right now,” Waltz said, attributing some of that to “a lot of misunderstanding on both sides.” He said officers will have to work toward putting themselves in others’ shoes and trying to be aware of when people may feel unsafe. Related Protesters with Black Lives Matter movement descend on Brunswick Police Department In the same vein, though, Waltz said crowding police and immediately questioning officers’ actions can also create tension. “We need to have more understanding on both sides,” he said. Waltz commended protester Toby Holton, who he said helped calm the crowd Sunday night, even as tensions started to rise. “I can tell you that many of us were scared,” Waltz said, “not because we’re cowards, but because if there were a few more agitators, that could have gone in the opposite direction.” “We don’t want people hurt, we don’t want officers hurt and we don’t want property damaged,” he said. On Sunday, Holton said he was recently pulled over by a Brunswick Police officer and was afraid, but said the interaction ultimately was peaceful. Hearing about Holton’s initial fear was important, Waltz said, because officers may not always know when someone is feeling unsafe. Holton started “important dialogue we needed to hear,” he said. In Bath, roughly 50 people protested peacefully on Monday, marching from the courthouse to City Hall to the police department. Bath police officers did not join the protest, Chief Mike Field said, because the gathering remained peaceful and he did not want the officers to disrupt or get in the way of their message. None of the protestors or event organizers have reached out to the department yet, Field said, though he said he’s willing to meet with anybody who has concerns. Related Black Lives Matter protesters march in Bath Field condemned Chauvin’s actions in a press release on Tuesday, and said what happened to Floyd was “wrong, criminal, against any police practice I know, and shocked me and our police officers to the core.” The action has damaged the department’s continuing efforts to build trust in the community, he added. “I don’t want people to be scared of us,” he said in an interview. “We’re part of the community. We have a job to do to maintain public safety, but if people are scared, I want to hear about it, I want to have that discussion.” Field also said in his statement that the department will not tolerate any form of racism. “People will be treated equally and fairly. When action must be taken, it will be within policy, and at the least level needed. If anything other than that occurs, we will hold officers accountable,” he said. He added that he hopes these protests will open avenues for communication that can lead to peace and healing. Joel Merry, Sagadahoc County Sheriff, also said he has not been contacted by any protesters, but that he would “welcome the opportunity to sit down and talk to anyone about any issues.” “I think the more dialogue that we can have, the better we can begin to understand and get to view one another’s take on the things that are happening,” he said. Merry applauded the protesters for remaining peaceful, staying on the sidewalk, not blocking traffic and not vandalizing any property, as has been the case in some rallies in other parts of the country. “I believe there was an opportunity for folks to show that over time our country hasn’t effectively or properly addressed the issues related to racial inequality. … We need to have that conversation that there still remains racism in our country today and the only way to do that is to civilly sit down and express our point of view and listen,” he said. “There’s a lot of anger out there and we’re got to let the anger out but in a constructive way so these folks can be heard.” Merry added that he hopes the voices of the people who want to be heard will rise above those who are looting and destroying property and not let their message be “clouded by the senseless acts of violence and destruction.” The department’s deputies have received implicit bias training and take issues around treating everyone fairly very seriously, he said, and asked that any future protests continue to be done peacefully. “It makes (the message) much clearer,” he said. “We look forward to the dialogue.

1623736577,2020-06-02 18:51:22,Protests in top 25 virus hot spots ignite fears of contagion,https://www.centralmaine.com/2020/06/02/protests-in-top-25-virus-hot-spots-ignite-fears-of-contagion/,en,False,,29592,onlinesentinel.com,http://www.onlinesentinel.com#spider,"PROVIDENCE, R.I. — As demonstrators flooded streets across America to decry the killing of George Floyd, public health experts watched in alarm – the close proximity of protesters and their failures in many cases to wear masks, along with the police using tear gas, could fuel new transmissions of the coronavirus. Many of the protests broke out in places where the virus is still circulating widely in the population. In fact, an Associated Press review found that demonstrations have taken place in every one of the 25 U.S. communities with the highest concentrations of new cases. Some have seen major protests over multiple days, including Minneapolis-St. Paul, Chicago, Washington, D.C., and Los Angeles. The protests have come just as communities across the nation loosen restrictions on businesses and public life that have helped slow the spread of the virus, deepening concern that the two factors taken together could create a national resurgence in cases. “As a nation, we have to be concerned about a rebound,” Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser warned Sunday after days of protests rocked the nation’s capital. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo bemoaned the crowds, saying that hundreds could potentially have been infected, undoing months of social distancing. A fresh outbreak in the places where protesters gathered could lead to reinstituting shutdowns. The AP’s review focused on large metro counties – the central counties within metro areas with more than 1 million people – that showed the highest rates of new cases per capita over the past 14 days. While case numbers and deaths have been trending down in several of the cities where the largest protests have occurred, the number of people in those places infected with the virus – and with the ability to spread it – remains high. And in some of the communities, such as Minneapolis, the number of people hospitalized with COVID-19 has been rising. Floyd died May 25 after a Minneapolis police officer pressed a knee into his neck for several minutes, even as he pleaded that he couldn’t breathe. Minneapolis has been ground zero for the sprawling protests, which have crossed the Mississippi River into neighboring St. Paul. The unrest has coincided with “the very worst days of the pandemic so far” in the Twin Cities metropolitan area, said Michael T. Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota. “Our ICU bed care is at its all-time high and is really on the edge,” he said. Ramsey and Hennepin counties, home to the Twin Cities, ranked seventh and eighth for the highest per capita new cases in the AP analysis. Each has seen more than 250 cases per 100,000 population in the past two weeks, together reporting nearly 2,000 new cases in the last week alone. Experts point out that other factors associated with protests could accelerate the spread of the virus. For instance, tear gas can cause people to cough and sneeze, as can the smoke from fires set by people bent on destruction. And both also prompt protesters to remove their masks. Crowding protesters who have been arrested into jail cells can also increase the risk of contagion. An AP tally found that, thus far, more than 5,600 people have been taken into custody. Protesters and police shouting at one another nose-to-nose also is raising alarms. Osterholm and other public health experts note, however, that the protests aren’t necessarily as alarming as other events that could fuel new cases because they take place outside and many people are wearing masks. In some cases, hand sanitizer also is being informally distributed. And Dr. David Eisenman, director of the Center for Public Health and Disasters at the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health, said he feared partisan forces might accuse cities of bringing fresh cases on themselves. “I’m actually more worried about how, if those spikes occur, how that information will be weaponized against the notion of protests,” he said. Eisenman called protesting an “essential activity,” possible to practice with reduced risk. He said his grown children protested in Los Angeles and are taking safety precautions now, including isolating themselves at home. They plan to get tested for COVID-19 in about a week. Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician and public health professor at George Washington University, said the hospitalizations for coronavirus in the Washington metro area have been on the decline but that she knows that could change. “There are a lot of unknowns about what happens next,” she said. Wen was the health commissioner for the city of Baltimore during the 2015 uprising after the death of Freddie Gray in police custody and said many health clinics were closed and pharmacies burned down, making it difficult for members of disadvantaged communities to access health care. It’s a concern for her now, too. “You will have compounded health issues that go beyond COVID-19,” she said. Public health experts said it will take two to three weeks to know whether the protests cause a surge in coronavirus cases. And even then, they can’t definitively tie it to the demonstrations. The unrest is happening in tandem with the reopening of gyms, hair salons, restaurants, parks and beaches. It also comes on the heels of the Memorial Day weekend, when many people attended large gatherings, so experts already were bracing for a case increase, said Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins University. In Los Angeles, barbershops and in-person dining were allowed to resume last weekend, just as protests descended into destruction and more than 1,000 people were arrested. Nearly 10,000 new cases have been reported in Los Angeles County in the past week. Hundreds of people also were arrested in Chicago, where Cook County has had among the highest per capita rates of new cases of any large county in the nation, with 283 new cases per 100,000 population in the past two weeks. “The absolute number of cases is still high. We feel good about the fact that we’ve established a decreasing incidence, but we have a ways to go,” said Dr. Ronald Hershow the director of the Division of Epidemiology and Biostatistics at the University of Illinois-Chicago. Hershow and others noted that the racial disparities laid bare by coronavirus — with communities of color bearing a disproportionate burden of infections and deaths — overlap with the issues being protested on streets across America and around the globe. “Racism kills,” Hershow said. “Sometimes that’s direct, as in the case of George Floyd. And sometimes it’s through a virus like COVID-19.” Send questions/comments to the editors. filed under:",0.0
1623736973,2020-06-02 17:56:47,Portland chief meets with protest organizers as demonstrations continue,https://www.centralmaine.com/2020/06/02/portland-chief-meets-with-protest-organizers-as-demonstrations-continue/,en,False,,25755,Central Maine News,https://www.centralmaine.com/,"City officials Tuesday spoke with the leaders of two groups that have brought more than 1,000 demonstrators into Portland’s streets over the past four days to protest racism and police brutality. Portland’s police chief, city manager and mayor, along with other state and local officials, met virtually on Tuesday with two organizers of the downtown protests to listen to concerns that have fueled angry marches around the country. Officials also made contact with a third organizer, whose rally Monday night turned destructive and confrontational and led to a prolonged clash with police that lasted into Tuesday morning. The meetings and phone calls represent a game of catch-up for city officials, who had been trying to make contact with organizers since Friday, City Manager Jon Jennings said. Part of the delay stems from the shutdown of city government in response to the coronavirus pandemic, he said, and the organic nature of the demonstrations themselves. “What happened in Minnesota was beyond outrageous,” Jennings said. “So we understand the anger that’s in the community. So, in the beginning we’ve wanted to work cooperatively with them but we didn’t really know who the organizers were.” Jennings said typically when groups want to demonstrate, they can communicate with city officials. But the COVID-19 response has led to furloughs, including of the permitting staff who typically handle requests for police and city assistance during demonstrations. That left the city without a clear idea of logistics or what to expect. Hamdia Ahmed and Abdul Ali, who organized a protest on Friday and are now planning a demonstration Wednesday outside the Portland police station, met via a Zoom meeting with city leaders to discuss issues of race and policing, and the broad, overarching issue of police treatment of black and brown people across the country, Police Chief Frank Clark said. The problems are systemic, Ahmed said, and she did not single out the Portland department, according to Clark. Other participants in the meeting were Portland Mayor Kate Snyder, Maine Commissioner of Public Safety Michael Sauschuck, Cumberland County District Attorney Jonathan Sahrbeck, Westbrook Police Chief Janine Roberts, Portland City Councilor Pious Ali and representatives of the Portland school department, said Jessica Grondin, a city spokeswoman. “We did a lot of listening,” Clark said. “They articulated that they wanted to be heard. They wanted us to hear them. We vowed to continue the conversations.” Ahmed told the police leaders they wanted the protests to be peaceful, Clark said. Reached Tuesday, Ahmed declined to speak to a reporter. Jennings, the city manager, has also kept in contact with another organizer, David Thete, who put together the demonstration on Monday evening that drew an estimated 1,000 protesters and later turned violent and confrontational. Jennings said he is working to get Clark and Thete to meet, and to arrange for Clark to speak to demonstrators at some point, but it was unclear whether he would do so Tuesday night or at some point in the future. Thete’s group has sought since Friday to place a memorial on the steps leading to the Portland Police station dedicated to all people of color killed by police, but repeatedly that memorial has been moved or taken down after demonstrations subside. On Tuesday, Jennings reached a compromise. Signs, candles and other mementos will be moved away from the staircase so they don’t block the staircase. Jennings also addressed police and protester conduct at the Monday rally, and blamed agitators from out of state for causing trouble. “The police were not antagonistic until it began to spiral out of control, meaning there were rocks in socks being flung, bottles of urine being thrown at officers, bricks being thrown at officers,” Jennings said. “At some point you have to take matters into your hands to restore public order. The folks who were causing the problems last night were not part of the people (demonstrating), they were coming from all over New England, from Massachusetts.” Asked how he knew the home community of some of the roughly 1,000 people who crammed the streets, he at first said the city has “sources and methods.” He said police, to his knowledge, are not monitoring cell phone traffic, but instead are monitoring social media. “Do you have SnapChat?” Jennings said. Different groups of demonstrators have gathered by the hundreds in downtown Portland since last Friday, as similar and sometimes more violent protests erupted in cities across the country. Ahmed organized a demonstration last Friday in which hundreds of people blocked traffic along Franklin Street and at Congress Square Park near High and Congress streets. Thete’s demonstration – also last Friday – saw hundreds of other demonstrators march on City Hall and the police station on Middle Street. Thete’s group returned Sunday, and demonstrators demanded to meet with Clark. Clark did not address a crowd of protesters who gathered outside the police station Sunday. On Monday, he said he reached out to organizers to arrange a meeting or meetings. Requests for an interview with Thete left through social media were not returned Monday or Tuesday, and Ahmed said Tuesday afternoon she would release a statement regarding Clark’s offer, and declined to speak on the phone. Clark on Tuesday said he is viewing the confrontation and the escalation that occurred Monday as an anomaly. “We certainly won’t condone breaking the law and the destruction of property,” Clark said. “But we’re literally going into this as a new day, and hope we see the level of cooperation we had (last) Friday and we’re going to ask people and plead with people to work with us in that regard.” Clark has made several statements condemning Floyd’s death, but has not directly called the incident murder as some police officials in other cities have. Other city officials have spoken about Floyd’s death and the demonstrations, which have taken place in hundreds of cities across the country and drawn millions of participants demanding racial justice and police reform. Portland’s City Council passed a resolution Monday condemning the recent killings of unarmed black men in other states and “all forms of racism and police brutality.” The resolution says city leaders pledge to protect the rights of all people and commits to “calling out hate and discrimination when we see it.” Mayor Kate Snyder spoke in support of the council’s proclamation condemning racism and police brutality, and has posted messages on Facebook condemning the killing of Floyd and supporting the peaceful protests. In a video posted on Facebook Monday, Snyder says she was outraged, stunned, sad and left speechless by Floyd’s death. She thanked those speaking up and shining light “on this horrific crime” and offered love and compassion to Floyd’s family and his community, and to the Portland community. On Tuesday, she posted that she plans to attend a peaceful protest Wednesday afternoon in Portland. Her posts have generated some support, as well as criticism from people who want the mayor and other city leaders to be more visible and to address the outrage publicly.

Few new details emerged Tuesday about Trump’s planned tour of the Puritan Medical Products facility that produces swabs used in coronavirus tests. The White House did not release additional information and the office of Gov. Janet Mills did not respond to requests for an interview one day after she raised security concerns about the presidential visit at a time of violent protests and political unrest nationwide. Piscataquis County Sheriff Robert Young, however, said in a post on Facebook that he hopes “folks will let the employees of Hardwood Products/Puritan Medical Products have their moment of recognition, as the President, on behalf of the nation, expresses our collective thanks.” “In ordinary times, a Presidential visit to Guilford, Maine would be a great thing, regardless of who the President is,” Young wrote. “Sadly, at this time, our nation is so full of strife and rancor, that the good nature of his coming is overshadowed by the politics of our time.” Trump’s trip to Guilford on Friday is the latest in a series of visits to U.S. manufacturers producing protective gear, testing equipment and medical supplies during the coronavirus pandemic. Puritan Medical Products received a $75.5 million federal grant to double its swab production – from 20 million to 40 million units monthly – to help expand COVID-19 testing capacity nationwide. At least one rally, dubbed a “Guilford, Maine Peaceful Protest for Black Lives Matter” was being promoted on Facebook and had drawn “interest” from more than 1,700 people as of Tuesday evening. Organizers of the event did not respond to messages seeking to be interviews about the event. The president’s supporters, meanwhile, were using social media to urge others to “to line every street he drives on.” Young wrote that he has been in contact with the protest organizers and “their motives and intent are good, they want to speak for social change and are heartbroken by what they see happening to their country.” “They desire the protest to be peaceful, and I believe they will do all they can to keep it so,” Young said. “I’m asking those who oppose the protest to do so peacefully as well. Violence generally begets violence, and is never going to solve the issues of our land.” Young also expressed shock and dismay at the Minneapolis police officer’s actions, adding that, “In Piscataquis County we don’t use those tactics.” Young declined to comment beyond his Facebook post. The nation has been on edge since video emerged of a Minneapolis police officer kneeling on the neck of a black man, George Floyd, who had been detained on minor charges. Floyd repeatedly told the officers that he couldn’t breathe before losing consciousness and dying. That officer has since been charged with murder. While the majority of ensuing protests nationwide have been peaceful, some have turned violent as police clashed with rioters damaged properties and looted businesses. Those mass gatherings come at a time when the nation is in the midst of a highly infectious viral pandemic that has killed more than 100,000 people. Portland police dressed in riot gear and using pepper spray arrested 23 people late Monday night and early Tuesday morning after hundreds of protesters refused to disperse. Trump’s words and actions Monday night heightened tensions as he threatened to send the military units into states and then staged a photo op outside of a church near the White House moments after law enforcement used tear gas and flash grenades to clear a crowd of peaceful protesters. On Monday evening Mills expressed concerns about Trump’s planned visit to Maine following an earlier conference calls in which he accused governors of being “weak” on violent protests and urged them to use force to “dominate” the streets. “I ask that when you arrive here, you rise above the language that I heard this morning,” Mills said. “I ask that you check the rhetoric at the door and abandon the divisive language that sows the seeds of distrust among our people.” Mills made those comments roughly 90 minutes before television networks broadcast live images of officers aggressively clearing the park in front of the White House. Mills’ office did not respond to comments Tuesday about the president’s vow to send the military into states that failed to quell violent protests. This will be Trump’s first visit to Maine since taking office in 2017, but it might not be his last this year. Some critics view the trip as a campaign event as his supporters attempt to repeat his 2016 performance when he picked up one of Maine’s four Electoral College votes by winning the 2nd Congressional District. Dover-Foxcroft Police Chief Ryan Reardon said it was clear to him that Floyd was “murdered” by the officer in Minneapolis and should have been arrested immediately. Reardon added that he believes “every law enforcement officer in Piscataquis County agrees with the sentiment.” But Reardon, whose officers will likely be called upon to assist with security on Friday, said for any U.S. president to come to Guilford — located in one of the poorest counties east of the Mississippi River — is “kind of a big deal.” So Reardon said he hopes others who come to town Friday will “express your opinion, but do it peacefully” while allowing the larger focus to be on Puritan employees’ vital contribution to the nation’s coronavirus response. “I’m really hoping this is a peaceful gathering and a peaceful event, that the president can tour this very nice facility and let the people have pride in their jobs,” Reardon said.

Few new details emerged Tuesday about Trump’s planned tour of the Puritan Medical Products facility that produces swabs used in coronavirus tests. The White House did not release additional information and the office of Gov. Janet Mills did not respond to requests for an interview one day after she raised security concerns about the presidential visit at a time of violent protests and political unrest nationwide. Piscataquis County Sheriff Robert Young, however, said in a post on Facebook that he hopes “folks will let the employees of Hardwood Products/Puritan Medical Products have their moment of recognition, as the President, on behalf of the nation, expresses our collective thanks.” “In ordinary times, a Presidential visit to Guilford, Maine would be a great thing, regardless of who the President is,” Young wrote. “Sadly, at this time, our nation is so full of strife and rancor, that the good nature of his coming is overshadowed by the politics of our time.” Trump’s trip to Guilford on Friday is the latest in a series of visits to U.S. manufacturers producing protective gear, testing equipment and medical supplies during the coronavirus pandemic. Puritan Medical Products received a $75.5 million federal grant to double its swab production – from 20 million to 40 million units monthly – to help expand COVID-19 testing capacity nationwide. At least one rally, dubbed a “Guilford, Maine Peaceful Protest for Black Lives Matter” was being promoted on Facebook and had drawn “interest” from more than 1,700 people as of Tuesday evening. Organizers of the event did not respond to messages seeking to be interviews about the event. The president’s supporters, meanwhile, were using social media to urge others to “to line every street he drives on.” Young wrote that he has been in contact with the protest organizers and “their motives and intent are good, they want to speak for social change and are heartbroken by what they see happening to their country.” “They desire the protest to be peaceful, and I believe they will do all they can to keep it so,” Young said. “I’m asking those who oppose the protest to do so peacefully as well. Violence generally begets violence, and is never going to solve the issues of our land.” Young also expressed shock and dismay at the Minneapolis police officer’s actions, adding that, “In Piscataquis County we don’t use those tactics.” Young declined to comment beyond his Facebook post.

We will not support a platform that incites violence, racism and lives hashtag black lives matter. Frank told CNBC the companies were in final negotiations on a six figure content partnership is at his company would have netted hundreds of thousands of dollars in the deal, which would have provided free therapy to some users. But Frank said he'd be willing to reopen discussions if Facebook improved its methods for moderating content. In the wake of the protests surrounding George Floyd's death, Trump shared a post saying. When the looting starts, the shooting starts. Twitter added labels saying it violated Twitter's rules about glorifying violence and move. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg openly disagreed with telling Fox News. I just believe strongly that Facebook shouldn't be the arbitrator of truth of everything that people say online. On Monday, there was a virtual walk out among Facebook employees who felt Trump's post violated their platform standards Advertisement Tensions rise among Facebook staff as Mark Zuckerberg gives explanation for inaction on President Trump posts Share Shares Copy Link Copy Video above: Facebook loses deal over its reaction to trump ‘looting’ post, employees stage virtual walkoutFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg sought Tuesday to ease employee outrage over his inaction on incendiary remarks recently posted by President Donald Trump.During a company-wide town hall, Zuckerberg struggled to explain his decision-making process as many of his employees, using a real-time feedback tool, reminded him of promises to remove content that calls for violence or that could lead to imminent physical harm.""It's crystal clear today that leadership refuses to stand with us,"" Brandon Dail, an engineer at Facebook, tweeted as the town hall was taking place.Facebook spokesman Andy Stone said in a statement to CNN Business that open and honest discussion ""has always been a part of Facebook's culture.""""Mark had an open discussion with employees today, as he has regularly over the years,"" Stone said. ""He's grateful for their feedback.""The meeting has threatened to ratchet up tensions at Facebook, which has been hit with allegations of right-wing bias from conservatives and criticized by others for tacitly condoning the spread of hate and racism.Another Facebook employee told CNN Business they found Zuckerberg's answers to staff questions at the town hall lacking, and said the CEO risked alienating more of his staff rather than addressing their concerns.During the event, Facebook staff shared links to a video of an exchange between Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Zuckerberg last October when he said: ""If anyone, including a politician, is saying things that can cause, that is calling for violence or could risk imminent physical harm ... we will take that content down.""At one point, roughly 22,000 people had tuned into the live video feed, according to another Facebook worker who was watching the stream. The figure reflects nearly half of the company's 48,000 employees.The top question for Zuckerberg, which called for changes to the company's stance on political speech, received more than 5,400 votes from workers, the employee said.Not all employees disagree with Zuckerberg's position, however. One told CNN Business, ""Supporting free speech - especially when you vehemently disagree with what the person is saying - is a hard but important stance needed to make sure everyone can have a voice.""The employee said it is hard to be sure what portion of Facebook's staff supports Zuckerberg's decision. At least a few people with whom they have spoken do support it but are nervous to say so more publicly because they have seen the pushback within the company, the employee said.Tuesday's event follows days of employee activism over Facebook's handling of Trump's content.Some staffers staged a virtual walkout on Monday to protest decisions made by the company's leaders concerning posts by Trump. And at least one worker, software engineer Timothy Aveni, has quit his job, saying it is no longer feasible to ""keep excusing Facebook's behavior.""Facebook's workforce is known for keeping its disputes with executives largely private. But that changed on Friday, when Zuckerberg announced he would not act against content by Trump that Twitter had flagged earlier as having violated its own rules. The decision has prompted widespread criticism within Facebook that has spilled into public, with numerous employees expressing their disagreement on Twitter.One of Trump's posts had claimed, in reference to the demonstrations in Minneapolis, that ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts"" — a phrase with racist origins. Trump later professed not to know the history of the phrase, but he allowed the original remark to stand on Facebook and Twitter.Zuckerberg said the content provoked in him a ""visceral negative reaction."" But he justified his decision not to act against the posts, citing his responsibility as the ""leader of an institution committed to free expression.""In the eyes of his harshest internal critics, Zuckerberg had simply caved on prior principled commitments.""Mark can patch this one section of Facebook's policies, but if he derives his principle from the particular actions he wants to take, instead of taking action based on principle, it'll be fruitless in the long run,"" Aveni said in response to a CNN reporter's question on his post.",0.0

Bush addressed the nationwide protests in a solemn yet hopeful statement Tuesday, commending the Americans demonstrating against racial injustice and criticizing those who try to silence them. Bush closed his statement, which came a day after peaceful protesters were cleared by force to make way for President Trump to come outside, by pointing to a “better way.” “There is a better way – the way of empathy, and shared commitment, and bold action, and a peace rooted in justice,” Bush said in the statement. “I am confident that together, Americans will choose the better way.” Describing himself as “anguished” by the death of George Floyd, a black man who died more than a week ago after his neck was held under the knee of a white Minneapolis police officer, Bush urged white Americans to seek ways to support, listen and understand black Americans who still face “disturbing bigotry and exploitation.” The statement by the nation’s 43rd president does not mention Trump, but his call for compassion and unity presents a stark contrast to the current president’s more inflammatory rhetoric. “The only way to see ourselves in a true light is to listen to the voices of so many who are hurting and grieving,” Bush said. “Those who set out to silence those voices do not understand the meaning of America – or how it becomes a better place.” “We can only see the reality of America’s need by seeing it through the eyes of the threatened, oppressed, and disenfranchised,” he added. Bush also seemed to offer a veiled criticism of the aggressive stance taken by some police against protesters, saying, “It is a strength when protesters, protected by responsible law enforcement, march for a better future.” As president, Bush faced protest and backlash, first against his decision to go to war with Iraq and later for his handling of Hurricane Katrina, which devastated African American communities disproportionately. He and his family have had a strained relationship with Trump and have rejected his politics, though they have largely avoided directly criticizing him. Shortly after Bush released his statement, his former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mike Mullen, who has also said little critical of the current president, decried Trump’s response to the protests, specifically his desire to militarize it and use aggressive force, in an essay published by The Atlantic. Mullen wrote that he was “sickened” to see security forces deploy hostile measures on protesters outside the White House to clear the way for Trump to venture out for a photo op. “Whatever Trump’s goal in conducting his visit, he laid bare his disdain for the rights of peaceful protest in this country, gave succor to the leaders of other countries who take comfort in our domestic strife, and risked further politicizing the men and women of our armed forces,” Mullen said. Mullen, like Bush, stressed that people needed to understand that the root of these protests is the persistent racism African Americans face.” Send questions/comments to the editors. « Previous Next »",0.0

Unlike Monday’s protest, which was marred by arrests, burglary and vandalism, Tuesday’s demonstration was mostly peaceful with the highlight coming after Portland Police Chief Frank Clark and Portland City Manager Jon Jennings took a knee in solidarity with protesters on the steps of the police station. The protest started with about 300 people in Monument Square on Congress Street, where an organizer mentioned the previous night’s protests when violence and vandalism flared – resulting in the arrests of 23 people – and asked participants to avoid a similar situation Tuesday night. The woman, identified only as Mary, urged people to be peaceful, saying, “Yesterday was beautiful, but it didn’t end well, let’s do this right” referring to the arrests and vandalism that marred Monday’s protest. The procession of demonstrators then walked to the Portland Police Station on Middle Street where they were met by Clark and Jennings. After one speaker told the crowd that police officers needed to be trained to be more understanding and compassionate toward people of color, the crowd, which had swelled to about 500 people marched to the Eastern Prom where they staged a die-in, lying on their stomachs with their hands behind their backs while chanting, “I can’t breathe.” Those were the words George Floyd uttered as a former Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck until he lost consciousness and stopped breathing. The dramatic demonstration on the Eastern Prom lasted for about 9 minutes, roughly the same amount of time that former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin pressed down on Floyd’s neck with his knee while three other officers looked on. The situation in Portland Tuesday night became tense at times, with anti-protesters carrying American flags and one white man shouting expletives at a group of black men. Police wearing riot gear assembled at Pearl and Middle streets after a group of seven men dressed in orange hunting vests and carrying American flags began to agitate protesters. The men carried signs that said they supported police. Maine State Police and members of the Cumberland County Sheriff’s Office – the squads were dressed in riot gear – then marched down Pearl Street and stood nearby as a Portland police officer talked to the men. The group left peacefully and were not seen again. An officer was spotted on the rooftop of the Hampton Inn, leading to postings on social media about the possibility of a police sniper, a scenario dismissed by Portland Police spokesman Lt. Robert Martin. He was not certain how law enforcement resources were deployed Tuesday night, but said the officer was most likely an observer positioned to gain a better vantage point. Martin added that people shouldn’t jump to conclusions that the officer was carrying a weapon, saying he could have been using some type of observation device. By the time the demonstrators reached the Eastern Prom, the size of the crowd had grown to about 1,000 people. The protesters marched from the Eastern Prom down Congress Street to Congress Square, where organizers thanked everyone for what appeared to have been a largely peaceful demonstration. At around 8:45 p.m., organizers using a bullhorn urged everyone to “go home safe.” But at 10:15 p.m. a group of about 100 protesters reformed outside the police station and began setting off fireworks as police in riot gear lined up across Franklin Arterial and fired rubber bullets at protesters who threw bottles. Just before 11:30 police asked people to disperse and began advancing their line down Franklin Arterial, making a few arrests as they went. The outburst of violence mirrored events on Monday night, when over 1,000 protesters amassed outside the police station and engaged in a confrontation with police that moved around the downtown area and lasted until nearly 2 a.m. Officers from 15 other police departments joined Portland police and stood shoulder-to-shoulder carrying wooden batons and plastic riot shields. Everyone arrested during the demonstration posted bail by Tuesday morning, said Martin, the police spokesman. All but one person was charged with failure to disperse, a misdemeanor. One man, the driver of a tractor-trailer that entered the protest area near the intersection of Middle Street and Franklin Arterial, was charged with reckless conduct with dangerous weapon, a Class C felony. Throughout Monday night, there was a push and pull between organizers who sought to keep the demonstrations peaceful, and people who threw water bottles and other objects at the police, destroyed property and defaced businesses. At one point, some police knelt with protesters, drawing cheers from the crowd. Others talked with protesters from the police line, but most officers remained silent or did not react or engage. Protest organizers finally got a meeting with Chief Frank Clark on Tuesday after two days of trying. Hamdia Ahmed and Abdul Ali, who organized a protest on Friday and are planning a demonstration Wednesday outside the Portland police station, met via Zoom with Clark, Westbrook Police Chief Janine Roberts, and city and state leaders to discuss issues of race and policing, and the broad, overarching issue of police treatment of black and brown people across the country, Clark said. The problems are systemic, Ahmed said, according to Clark, and she did not single out the Portland department. “We did a lot of listening,” Clark said. “They articulated that they wanted to be heard. They wanted us to hear them. We vowed to continue the conversations.” Another organizer who planned the protest that became violent Monday has been communicating with city officials, as well. Protests have roiled the nation since the death of Floyd, 46, on May 25. Chauvin, the former officer, has been charged with murder in the death and the three officers who were with him were fired but have not been charged. After days of demonstrations, protesters undeterred by curfews coursed back into the nation’s streets Tuesday, hours after President Trump pressed governors to put down the violence set off by Floyd’s death and demanded that New York call up the National Guard to stop the “lowlifes and losers.” As more demonstrations began taking shape around the country, and cities including Washington prepared for another possible round of scattered violence after dark, the president amplified his hard-line calls of a day earlier, in which he threatened to send in the military to restore order if governors didn’t do it. Clark had released a statement Tuesday afternoon in which he expressed disgust at Floyd’s killing, but said a small segment of the demonstrators were determined to cause trouble, leading to the harsher response by officers. “Our goal remains providing a safe environment for those wishing to peacefully express their views and First Amendment rights,” Clark said in the statement. “We are fortunate that no one was seriously injured and that most of the property damage was minimal. Unfortunately, a committed smaller segment of this group ended up making this event anything other than a peaceful and lawful protest. They took the opportunity to commit acts of violence, damage public and private property and place my officers and the public at risk. We will not stand for such criminal behavior.” « Previous Next »",0.0

Maine State Police and members of the Cumberland County Sheriff’s Office – the squads were dressed in riot gear – then marched down Pearl Street and stood nearby as a Portland police officer talked to the men. The group left peacefully and were not seen again. An officer was spotted on the rooftop of the Hampton Inn, leading to postings on social media about the possibility of a police sniper, a scenario dismissed by Portland Police spokesman Lt. Robert Martin. He was not certain how law enforcement resources were deployed Tuesday night, but said the officer was most likely an observer positioned to gain a better vantage point. Martin added that people shouldn’t jump to conclusions that the officer was carrying a weapon, saying he could have been using some type of observation device. By the time the demonstrators reached the Eastern Prom, the size of the crowd had grown to about 1,000 people. The protesters marched from the Eastern Prom down Congress Street to Congress Square, where organizers thanked everyone for what appeared to have been a largely peaceful demonstration. At around 8:45 p.m., organizers using a bullhorn urged everyone to “go home safe.” But at 10:15 p.m. a group of about 100 protesters reformed outside the police station and began setting off fireworks as police in riot gear lined up across Franklin Arterial and fired rubber bullets at protesters who threw bottles. Just before 11:30 police asked people to disperse and began advancing their line down Franklin Arterial, making a few arrests as they went. The outburst of violence mirrored events on Monday night, when over 1,000 protesters amassed outside the police station and engaged in a confrontation with police that moved around the downtown area and lasted until nearly 2 a.m. Officers from 15 other police departments joined Portland police and stood shoulder-to-shoulder carrying wooden batons and plastic riot shields. Everyone arrested during the demonstration posted bail by Tuesday morning, said Martin, the police spokesman. All but one person was charged with failure to disperse, a misdemeanor. One man, the driver of a tractor-trailer that entered the protest area near the intersection of Middle Street and Franklin Arterial, was charged with reckless conduct with dangerous weapon, a Class C felony. Throughout Monday night, there was a push and pull between organizers who sought to keep the demonstrations peaceful, and people who threw water bottles and other objects at the police, destroyed property and defaced businesses. At one point, some police knelt with protesters, drawing cheers from the crowd. Others talked with protesters from the police line, but most officers remained silent or did not react or engage. Protest organizers finally got a meeting with Chief Frank Clark on Tuesday after two days of trying. Hamdia Ahmed and Abdul Ali, who organized a protest on Friday and are planning a demonstration Wednesday outside the Portland police station, met via Zoom with Clark, Westbrook Police Chief Janine Roberts, and city and state leaders to discuss issues of race and policing, and the broad, overarching issue of police treatment of black and brown people across the country, Clark said. The problems are systemic, Ahmed said, according to Clark, and she did not single out the Portland department. “We did a lot of listening,” Clark said. “They articulated that they wanted to be heard. They wanted us to hear them. We vowed to continue the conversations.” Another organizer who planned the protest that became violent Monday has been communicating with city officials, as well. Protests have roiled the nation since the death of Floyd, 46, on May 25. Chauvin, the former officer, has been charged with murder in the death and the three officers who were with him were fired but have not been charged. After days of demonstrations, protesters undeterred by curfews coursed back into the nation’s streets Tuesday, hours after President Trump pressed governors to put down the violence set off by Floyd’s death and demanded that New York call up the National Guard to stop the “lowlifes and losers.” As more demonstrations began taking shape around the country, and cities including Washington prepared for another possible round of scattered violence after dark, the president amplified his hard-line calls of a day earlier, in which he threatened to send in the military to restore order if governors didn’t do it. Clark had released a statement Tuesday afternoon in which he expressed disgust at Floyd’s killing, but said a small segment of the demonstrators were determined to cause trouble, leading to the harsher response by officers. “Our goal remains providing a safe environment for those wishing to peacefully express their views and First Amendment rights,” Clark said in the statement. “We are fortunate that no one was seriously injured and that most of the property damage was minimal. Unfortunately, a committed smaller segment of this group ended up making this event anything other than a peaceful and lawful protest. They took the opportunity to commit acts of violence, damage public and private property and place my officers and the public at risk. We will not stand for such criminal behavior.” Send questions/comments to the editors. « Previous Next »",0.0
1623818627,2020-06-02 22:06:21,"Curfews, pandemic test voters in primaries held amid unrest",https://www.pressherald.com/2020/06/02/curfews-pandemic-test-voters-in-primaries-held-amid-unrest/,en,False,,366984,pressherald.com,http://pressherald.com/,"Voters navigated curfews and health concerns in a slate of primary contests on Tuesday that tested the nation’s ability to host elections amid dueling crises and moved Joe Biden closer to formally clinching the Democratic presidential nomination. In all, nine states and the District of Columbia held elections, including four that delayed their April contests because of the coronavirus outbreak. With no real competition, Biden and President Trump easily won their respective primary elections in Indiana, Rhode Island, Maryland, New Mexico and the night’s biggest prize: Pennsylvania. Biden also won South Dakota. Voters waited in long lines that brushed up against curfews in Washington, D.C., and Philadelphia, two cities rocked by protests following the police killing of George Floyd. Officials in both places said voters wouldn’t be arrested for breaking curfew, but thousands of protesters defied the mayors’ orders at the same time, setting up a potential clash with law enforcement agencies and National Guard troops patrolling the streets during a fifth night of social unrest. Pennsylvania, which offered the day’s biggest trove of delegates, also represented a significant test case for Republicans and Democrats working to strengthen their operations in a premier general election battleground. Voters were forced to brave long lines in “militarized zones” because officials consolidated the vast majority of polling places in Philadelphia to minimize health risks, according to Erin Kramer, executive director of One Pennsylvania. She noted that some polling places in African American communities are in police stations. “Having to stand in line while police officers are entering and exiting the building on police business is not exactly how people want to spend their election day,” Kramer said. Biden was on the primary ballot in almost every state in his bid to unify Democrats behind his campaign against Trump. The former vice president is already the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, given that all his rivals have dropped out of the race, but he needs to win 89 percent of all delegates at stake on Tuesday to formally clinch the nomination. If he doesn’t secure the needed delegates Tuesday, he has other opportunities to do so this month. Biden was in Philadelphia on Tuesday morning to deliver remarks about the civil unrest that has erupted across the nation. He didn’t talk about the primary, instead focusing his attention on Trump, whom Biden blasted as “more interested in power than in principle.” Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is not actively campaigning, having suspended his operation and endorsed Biden, but his name will appear on the ballots. On the eve of Tuesday’s primaries, senior adviser Jeff Weaver encouraged progressives to vote for Sanders anyway. “People who support Bernie Sanders and his agenda, who want to maximize the influence of progressives at the convention, should cast their vote for Bernie Sanders,” Weaver said, reminding voters that the Vermont senator is seeking leverage to shape the party’s platform and rules. The comments serve as a reminder that Biden may have no legitimate Democratic rivals remaining but must still win over skeptical activists from his party’s far-left flank, who worry he’s too close to the political establishment. Party unity will likely be an afterthought this week, however, as more immediate health and safety concerns dominate the national conversation. The coronavirus death toll has surged past 100,000 nationwide, and thousands of new cases are reported each day. At the same time, several major cities, including some voting Tuesday, are grappling with protests. Some voters said Trump’s increasingly tough tone toward protesters inspired them to participate in the democratic process. Nicholas Autiello, who works in finance in Rhode Island, said he was disturbed by police driving back peaceful demonstrators near the White House on Monday. “Last night, we have a president who is acting like a dictator,” Autiello said. “So being able to come out here this morning and fill in a circle next to a name for someone who I know will restore honor and decency to the presidency was so important.” Political groups have had to adjust as some states move to a system that relies largely on voting by mail. They include Montana, where all 56 counties decided to vote entirely by mail. Voting rights watchdogs in multiple states have expressed concerns about access to mail ballots, confusion about deadlines and a shortage of poll workers that could lead to long lines. Those voting Tuesday include the District of Columbia, Indiana, Maryland, Montana, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and South Dakota. Two other states holding primary elections, Idaho and Iowa, chose its presidential nominee early in the year and is now focused on other offices. “We are in unique times, and voting is a unique challenge for people,” said Josh Schwerin, chief strategist for the pro-Democrat super PAC Priorities USA. He said that his organization and others will be watching closely on Tuesday “to see how well it works, where issues are and where obstacles have been put in place.” Send questions/comments to the editors. filed under:",0.0
1623819569,2020-06-02 22:02:34,‘We won’t tolerate’: Sports world unites behind George Floyd protests,https://www.sunjournal.com/2020/06/02/we-wont-tolerate-sports-world-unites-behind-george-floyd-protests/,en,False,,68001,sunjournal.com,http://www.sunjournal.com/#spider,"Players who scored in the German and Hungarian soccer leagues removed their jerseys to display undershirts with the words: “Justice for George Floyd.” Others from English soccer clubs Liverpool, Chelsea and Newcastle dropped to one knee during practice in a clear gesture of support. In New Zealand, a Nigerian-born UFC fighter addressed a crowd of 4,000, imploring those listening to “speak up” and take peaceful action to register their discontent. Dismayed by the death of Floyd and inspired by the actions of Colin Kaepernick, athletes from around the world have come together during one of the most politically charged periods in modern history. “I can’t tolerate. I won’t tolerate. WE WON’T TOLERATE,” Manchester United midfielder Paul Pogba, one of the world’s most famous soccer players and a World Cup champion with France, wrote on his Instagram page to his 41 million followers alongside a picture of him looking to the sky with a clenched right fist. It was powerful image to accompany the picture of 29 Liverpool players kneeling around the center circle at Anfield Stadium at the end of a practice session on Monday. Or the entire Chelsea squad kneeling down and forming the letter “H” — for humans — during training on Tuesday. Their actions mimicked the one made by Kaepernick during the national anthem in 2016 in silent protest of police brutality and racism while then playing for the San Francisco 49ers. Kaepernick’s gesture kicked off a period of pregame activism in the NFL and other sports but it didn’t gain a strong hold worldwide. Not like the killing of Floyd, a black man and former community college basketball player who died after a white police officer pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck for several minutes even after he stopped moving and stopped pleading for air. “It hit a nerve in this very particular time, which I think made people all around the world reflect on the environment we live, not only in the U.S. but in all kinds of places where there is a perpetuation of discrimination and inequality,” Jonas Baer-Hoffmann, secretary general of global soccer players union FIFPro, told The Associated Press. “We’re seeing a generation of players right now moving into the steps of athletes in the past who were socially quite engaged and willing to put themselves behind causes they care about. I think it’s incredibly empowering to see these players step forward and share in that fight for a better society.” Things have escalated so much that FIFA, the governing body of world soccer, took the rare step of urging competition organizers to consider not sanctioning players who support justice for Floyd during matches. The laws of the game prohibit “any political, religious or personal slogans, statements or images.” “The application of the laws of the game … should use common sense and have in consideration the context surrounding the events,” FIFA said, acknowledging “the depth of sentiment” regarding Floyd’s death. English soccer leaders have already said players will be able to show solidarity without the prospect of facing sanctions when games resume this month after a three-month break because of the coronavirus pandemic. Emboldened soccer players appear to be more confident in speaking out about racism than ever before, including Jadon Sancho, who revealed a handwritten “Justice for George Floyd” message on his undershirt after scoring a goal for Borussia Dortmund on Sunday, openly and knowingly flouting the rules. Marcus Rashford, a black striker for Manchester United, called for justice for Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor — two other black people killed in shooting incidents in America this year — on Twitter in the wake of Floyd’s death. Soccer players may also take what has happened to Floyd more personally because of how often black players have been abused inside stadiums around Europe in recent years. The sanctions for racism — if they are handed out at all — can often be derisory. As their own form of protest, some black players have taken to walking off the field after being racially abused by fans because many have little faith in authorities and governing bodies to effect change. That’s the position many protesters in the United States are finding themselves in. Baer-Hoffman said the reaction of sports stars was a reflection of uncertain times around the world since the outbreak of the coronavirus. “Maybe it’s because we are living in a time where the interconnectedness of people through the pandemic has become more conscious to us all,” he said. “When you look at the images (of the incident involving Floyd), it is manifestly disturbing. It scares you and forces you to think … I think it stands for something much greater. For footballers in this context, they are people … They are speaking out and, of course, have a bigger platform than most.” When Kaepernick took a knee four years ago, United States star Megan Rapinoe was one of the few high-profile soccer players to champion his cause publicly. But the clear parallel between Kaepernick’s action and the knee of the police officer on Floyd’s neck has roused more athletes to speak out. “In no way are we asking black lives to matter more than white lives,” DeAndre Yedlin, a U.S. soccer international who plays with Newcastle in England, wrote on Twitter. “All we’re asking is we are seen as equal, as more than 3/5 of a man, as humans. My heart goes out in solidarity to George Floyd, his family, and all of the countless number of victims that have had their lives taken at the hands of meaningless police brutality.” « Previous Next »",0.0

Harold Varner III illustrated as much with thoughtful observations he posted on social media after civil unrest in America over the weekend reached levels not seen in more than 50 years. “I’ve received more messages than ever before, mostly from people who wanted me to speak up immediately because of who I am. I AM BLACK,” his post began. “But it’s not helpful to anyone when impulsive, passionate reaction takes precedence over clear-minded thought.” What followed from Varner, one of three PGA Tour members of black heritage, was just that. He referred to the “senseless killing” of George Floyd, the handcuffed black man who died last week when a white police officer in Minneapolis put a knee to the back of his neck until he stopped breathing. “To me, it was evil incarnate,” Varner said. “There are objective truths in life. I think that’s one of them,” he wrote in his Monday post. Varner also cautioned against single-minded thoughts, that one can be against police killing a man while saying that burning businesses and police stations is wrong. “We can go beyond the trap of one-dimensional thinking. Once we do, our eyes will see the righteous, our hearts will feel the love, and we’ll have done more to honor all those subjected to evil and its vile nature,” he concluded. The more prominent voice is Tiger Woods, whose profile worldwide is so great that he chose early in his career not to get too opinionated on social issues. One example was two years ago at Riviera, during Black History Month, when he was asked during a news conference what concerned him about the plight of black Americans. Woods was smart in his delivery, short on substance, when he said African Americans have had their share of struggles, it has gotten better and there’s room for improvement. Accurate and safe. His tweet Monday night arrived shortly before 10 p.m. in Florida. It began with his heart going out to Floyd, his loved ones and “all of us who are hurting right now.” And while he said he has “the utmost respect” for law enforcement and the training involved to know how, when and where to use force, “This shocking tragedy clearly crossed that line.” Woods referenced the Rodney King riots in Los Angeles in 1992 — he was a teenager growing up in neighboring Orange County — and said “education is the best path forward.” “We can make our points without burning the very neighborhoods we live in,” he said. “I hope that through constructive, honest conversations we can build a safer, unified society.” Whether he said a little or a lot, Woods said something. That was important. Voices need to be heard, especially relevant ones. Golf doesn’t have many of those. It has a shabby history of inclusion, particularly when it comes to blacks, starting with the PGA of America taking until 1961 to drop its “Caucasian-only clause.” The PGA Tour now attracts the best from every corner of the globe. It can be an expensive game, yet not even the privileged are assured of making it. Woods said in a 2009 interview on being the only black on tour, “It’s only going to become more difficult for African Americans now, because golf has opened up around the world.” And so where does golf fit in the discussion of equality and justice? The PGA Tour is the only major sports league that did not issue a public statement or reference the views of its players on the homepage of its website. Would anyone have taken it seriously given the composition and color of the tour’s membership? Did it need to carve out a spot on the dais that already was crowded with voices from other sports that are far more germane to the issues? Commissioner Jay Monahan was searching for answers over the weekend and ultimately chose to keep his thoughts within the tour, sending a letter Monday to his staff and then sharing it with the players. “The hardships and injustices that have and continue to impact the African-American community are painful to watch and difficult to comprehend,” Monahan wrote. “And as a citizen of this country and a leader of this organization, I must admit that I’m struggling with what my role should be. But I am determined to help and make a difference.” Monahan said he had several “meaningful and emotional” conversations with colleagues and friends in the black community, “who — once again — showed me that sometimes listening and making a commitment to understand are the only things you can offer, and that’s OK.” “What I was left with was this,” he wrote. “Make no mistake about it — someone you know and care about is hurting right now, even if they haven’t told you that directly. … And if anyone at the tour is hurting, we should all hurt.” He also included a link from the Refinery29 website on the unseen pain blacks endure. “Too often we just move on when we are not directly influenced by the news of the day,” he wrote. “Yes, we have all been impacted by the global pandemic, but we should also be painfully aware and impacted by the dividing lines in our country. “We might not know exactly what to do right now, but we shouldn’t be deterred.” The PGA Tour resumes next week at Colonial, back to its familiar world with little controversy and ample privilege. No other sport does charity as well as golf. This issue requires more than that. If the best it can do is listen and commit to understand, that’s OK.",0.0

No matter where Dave Doran worked, people loved him. Retired ST Louis City Police Officer David Ellison says Dorn helped him out of poverty and into a life as a police officer. Dave Doran was a great man. He was fair there, sharpest, cleanest. We came out of the car. His presence was well known and observed, and he meant business when it was time to take care of business. The Ethical Society of Police, which represents black officers in ST Louis, says Dorn was the type of brother that would have given his life to save them if he had. Too many of us younger officers looked up to him. He retired probably in 2004 so very well, like not very pleasant, and his wife still works here and a very sad time for our agency.

No arrests have been made.The shooting and theft apparently was posted on Facebook Live, but the video has since been taken down. It came on a violent night in St. Louis, where four officers were shot, officers were pelted with rocks and fireworks and 55 businesses were burglarized or damaged, including a convenience store that burned. Police also shot and gravely injured a burglary suspect who they say shot at officers.Cities across the U.S. have seen protests and violence since George Floyd died May 25 after a white Minneapolis officer pressed his knee into Floyd's neck for several minutes even after the handcuffed black man stopped moving and pleaded for air.Dorn, who was black, was a friend of the pawn shop’s owner and frequently checked on the business when alarms went off, his wife, St. Louis police Sgt. Ann Marie Dorn, told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.David Dorn served 38 years on the St. Louis police force before retiring in October 2007. He then became chief of Moline Acres, a small town in St. Louis County.Former St. Louis County police Chief Tim Fitch knew Dorn for 30 years and said they became close friends when Dorn and his wife were leading the St. Louis police department's Explorers program for young people interested in law enforcement careers, while Fitch was leading the county's program.“He was very dedicated to youth, especially disadvantaged youth,"" said Fitch, who led the St. Louis County Police Department from 2009 to 2014. “He wanted to see them succeed. He wanted to be a role model for those young men and women to go into law enforcement.”Dorn' s personality was “bigger than life,” Fitch said. ""He was a fun guy, a happy guy. You never had to wonder what he was thinking when somebody did something incredibly stupid like a crime because he would just say it as he saw it.”When he took over as chief in Moline Acres, Dorn made it clear that his officers would be held to the strictest of standards, Fitch said.“He wanted them to do the right thing all the time,"" Fitch said.The Ethical Society of Police, which represents black officers in St. Louis, said in a news release that Dorn was “the type of brother that would’ve given his life to save them if he had to.”St. Louis police Chief John Hayden called Dorn a ""fine captain.”“Many of us, the other officers, looked up to him,” Hayden said.

One of the largest peaceful protests on Tuesday was in Houston, hometown of George Floyd – the African American man whose death in Minneapolis police custody ignited an unprecedented national wave of marches and demonstrations. Journalists on the scene estimated there were 25,000 marchers, including Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner, a Democrat, some of Floyd’s childhood friends and a group of black cowboys on horseback. In many cities, the first hours of Tuesday evening appeared peaceful, with fewer violent confrontations between police and crowds than in past evenings. Protesters often sought to police themselves, according to journalists following them, yelling “peaceful protest!” at people attempting vandalism. In some cities, police allowed protesters to defy curfews as long as they remained peaceful. In Washington, protesters lingered long past curfew in front of the White House, with no response from the hundreds of police. In New Orleans, a police commander urged protesters to leave a highway bridge they had occupied. “We support you,” the commander said, according to video captured by Bryn Stole of the New Orleans Advocate/Times-Picayune. “We feel ashamed for what this officer (in Minneapolis) did to tarnish the badge.” Protesters left the bridge and went home, planning to come back again the next night. In other cities, local officials spent Tuesday dealing with violent incidents from previous evenings. In Atlanta, prosecutors charged six police officers with crimes, after they used stun guns on two unarmed black college students driving on a downtown street. In Richmond, the mayor apologized for an incident Monday in which police tear-gassed peaceful protesters. And in Philadelphia, the mayor criticized police officers for posing for photos with a group of white vigilantes carrying baseball bats and shovels. In New York, where looters have ransacked stores for several consecutive nights, Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, criticized New York City police and Mayor Bill de Blasio, a Democrat, for not doing enough. “The police in New York City were not effective at doing their job last night. Period,” said Cuomo, saying he was “outraged.” “They have to do a better job.” On Monday night, one New York police officer was beaten by looters, and another was struck by a car and seriously injured. They were among several police officers injured nationwide: An officer in Las Vegas was shot and gravely injured, four officers were wounded by gunfire in St. Louis, and two officers were injured in Buffalo when they were struck by a speeding car. Las Vegas police said that they had arrested a 20-year-old man in the shooting and that the officer remained in critical condition. In New York, de Blasio has resisted calling in National Guard troops to help and instead pleaded with community leaders to help stem the chaos. “Members of the clergy, come out now. I’m calling you out. Civic leaders, block associations, come out now and stand up for peace,” de Blasio said. In an effort to control looting, the city announced that it would limit vehicle traffic south of 96th Street – an area covering much of Manhattan – to residents, essential workers, police and delivery trucks. Nationwide, more than 60 million people were under curfews as a result of the protests, in 200 cities and 27 states. The measures are intended to separate peaceful protesters from looters and vandals, by requiring that the peaceful protesters demonstrate in daylight and then go home. Related Minnesota files civil rights charge against police in Floyd death At least 17,000 National Guard troops have been activated in response. In Washington – where peaceful protests and looting rampages have both occurred in recent days – downtown streets were full of Army trucks and federal agents on Tuesday. On Monday night, Army helicopters had flown low over protesters in Washington, blasting them with high wind from the rotors – a dangerous maneuver used to intimidate enemies on overseas battlefields. It was a moment unlike any in recent American history, as hundreds of cities already beset by the coronavirus pandemic faced a historic wave of protests. And still, the protests kept growing. In Washington, marchers filled one of the city’s major streets, headed toward the now-fortified downtown. In Milwaukee, thousands marched six miles in early summer heat. People knelt on the cobblestone streets of Nantucket, Massachusetts, marched in Morgantown, West Virginia, and crowded around police headquarters in El Paso, Texas. In many cases, they repeated some of Floyd’s last words: “I can’t breathe.” A Minneapolis police officer knelt on Floyd’s neck for more than eight minutes on May 25, not moving an inch when Floyd said he couldn’t breathe – or even when Floyd lost consciousness. The officer, Derek Chauvin, has been charged with third-degree murder. Three officers who were also on the scene have been fired but not charged with crimes. In Minnesota on Tuesday, Gov. Tim Walz, a Democrat, said the state had opened a civil rights investigation into the Minneapolis Police Department, looking at the past 10 years. “We’re not going to restore peace on our streets by having a bigger group of National Guard show up. We’re not going to establish peace on our streets by keeping a curfew in place all the time,” Walz said. “We’re going to establish peace on our streets when we address the systemic issues that caused it in the first place.” Former vice president Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, plans to attend Floyd’s funeral in Houston next week, an attorney for the Floyd family said. In the past, protests against excessive force have often remained localized to the city where they began, like Ferguson, Missouri, in 2014. This time is different. One possible reason: Americans are now far more likely to believe that police use excessive force against black people, even compared with a few years ago. A new study from Monmouth University, released Tuesday, found that 57 percent of Americans today believe police are more likely to use excessive force against black people. That represents an increase from the 34 percent of registered voters who said the same in 2016 following the police shooting of Alton Sterling in Louisiana, and the 33 percent who said so in 2014 after a grand jury did not indict a New York City police officer in the death of Eric Garner. President Donald Trump seems intent on ratcheting up the force used by police: He spent Tuesday on Twitter congratulating himself for using the National Guard in Washington and blasting de Blasio for not using it in New York. “Overwhelming force. Domination,” Trump wrote in one post. It’s unclear whether that strategy will deter the protesters. During the past 60 years, the U.S. military has learned the limits of “overwhelming force” when it has been applied to win political arguments and civilian hearts overseas. Trump now seems to be applying it to American politics, and American civilians. Even televangelist Pat Robertson, normally an ally of Trump, criticized him on Robertson’s TV show “The 700 Club.” Robertson said Trump was wrong to criticize governors for not being tough enough. “You just don’t do that, Mr. President! It isn’t cool,” Robertson said. On Monday, federal law enforcement officers suddenly used chemical gas and rubber bullets to clear a crowd of peaceful protesters from an area near the White House – allowing Trump to visit a nearby fire-damaged Episcopal church for a photo op. In a bizarre turn, Defense Secretary Mark Esper – who accompanied Trump to the church – told NBC News that “I didn’t know where I was going.” Esper said he thought they were going to tour a vandalized bathroom in a nearby park. On Tuesday, it was clear that the use of force had brought a backlash: Trump was denounced by Washington’s Episcopal bishop and its Catholic archbishop on the same day. Archbishop Wilton Gregory criticized a Washington Catholic facility, a shrine to Pope John Paul II, for hosting Trump for a visit Tuesday, the day after the forcible street-clearing. “Saint Pope John Paul II was an ardent defender of the rights and dignity of human beings. His legacy bears vivid witness to that truth,” Gregory said. “He certainly would not condone the use of tear gas and other deterrents to silence, scatter or intimidate them for a photo opportunity in front of a place of worship and peace.” The limits of Trump’s strategy were also obvious on the streets of Washington on Tuesday. There were Humvees in the streets. But the protesters kept coming.

An officer was struggling with a protester when someone walked up and shot the officer in the back of the head, a spokesman said. That same night, police confronted an armed man near a federal building that they were guarding amid the unrest, and an officer opened fire when he reached for a gun, according to Joseph Lombardo, the Las Vegas sheriff. The man was killed, while the officer wounded outside the hotel was on life support Tuesday. “With these protests, which are leading to riots, one tragedy is only leading to another,” Lombardo said, linking both shootings to the demonstrations against how police use force that have gripped the country. Police nationwide say they are facing increasing threats amid the unrest that has spread since George Floyd’s death in Minneapolis last week. Officers have been shot and injured in St. Louis, struck by cars in New York City and Buffalo and targeted with rocks and fireworks in Seattle, according to police. Officers also are facing criticism for using force against demonstrators protesting how police use force, including wielding tear gas and rubber bullets against bystanders, journalists and some peaceful demonstrators. Experts and civil rights advocates say they fear this dynamic could further inflame tensions and lead to an even harsher crackdown as police and protesters face off, particularly in the wake of President Donald Trump’s calls for authorities to “dominate the streets” and respond more fiercely. “It’s going to escalate to somewhere we have never been before,” said Joe Ested, a former police officer in Richmond, Virginia, who runs a group called Police Brutality Matters. “Because Trump is adding fuel to the fire. . . . He should be healing. And then you would see a different tone with police officers.” While many demonstrations nationwide have been peaceful, responses from government officials have increasingly focused on the factions setting fires, looting and destroying property. Police officials and authorities have struggled to respond, deploying an ungainly mix of responses that includes voicing support for peaceful protesters, denouncing violent actors, backing their officers and punishing misconduct within their own forces. In some cases, officers have been cheered for marching and kneeling with protesters. In others, they have been denounced for using brute force against protesters seemingly unprovoked. But the potential for more violence is worrisome observers said. “The longer this goes on, you are going to see both sides escalating,” said Ested. “No one is talking about solutions. Police are going out there thinking, we are getting hurt; let’s fight back.” Departments have imposed some punishment on their own ranks, including in Atlanta, where two officers were fired and six face criminal charges over video footage of them pulling young people from a car and the Richmond officers facing discipline for gassing peaceful protesters. But in other cases, police officials have struggled with their actions and words. In Los Angeles – where the police department has pledged to investigate a car filmed striking demonstrators – the police chief caused an outcry by saying people looting were just as responsible for Floyd’s death as officers, a statement he withdrew hours later. “I recognize that my initial words were terribly offensive,” Moore posted on Twitter. “Looting is wrong, but it is not the equivalent of murder and I did not mean to equate the two.” Authorities say that, like in Las Vegas, they have also faced potentially serious danger during the demonstrations. In St. Louis, where police officials say officers were hit with rocks, four officers were shot during the unrest there, although it was unclear if it was connected to the demonstration. John Hayden, the police chief, said he “believed some coward randomly shot at the police line.” Two officers were shot in the leg, one was shot in the arm and another in the foot, according to Hayden. “It’s an extraordinarily difficult time for officers – for their physical safety and the conditions under which they’re being forced to work,” said Bill Johnson, executive director and general counsel for the National Association of Police Organizations. “The attacks are quite literally becoming murderous.” In New York City, at least two officers were attacked during the overnight chaos late Monday and early Tuesday, officials said. A sedan sped through an intersection in the Bronx early Tuesday, hitting and injuring an officer who was taken to a hospital in serious condition, they said. In a separate incident late Monday, a video shared online showed people apparently attacking an officer before fleeing. Last week, a woman tossed a molotov cocktail into an occupied police vehicle, and others have been charged in similar attacks, while other police officials have been struck with bricks. New York officials have also faced criticism for how their own officers have used force. A widely circulated video clip captured New York police cars hitting people in crowds over the weekend. The police department opened an investigation and Dermot Shea, the commissioner, said he was “troubled” by video footage of police cars driving into protesters. Shea also said during a separate appearance that his officers were facing danger doing their jobs. “The police officers are out there,” Shea said Tuesday. “They are affecting arrests. They are putting themselves in harm’s way. They are being attacked.” Officers have been targeted in the past by people angry at law enforcement or the government. In 2014, two police officers and a shopper were killed by a husband-and-wife pair police later said had white-supremacist, anti-government views. That same year, weeks after a grand jury declined to indict an officer filmed with his arm around Eric Garner’s death, a gunman traveled to New York and ambushed and killed two officers. Two years later, amid widespread protests fueled by police shootings, gunmen targeted and killed five police officers in Dallas and then three more in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Overall, though, line-of-duty deaths have been falling for decades, said Lisa Dario, an assistant professor of criminology and criminal justice at Florida Atlantic University, who studied line of duty deaths between 1970 and 2016. “We found that policing has become remarkably safer for police officers,” she said, citing better health care and superior equipment, including body armor, as two of the possible reasons for that. The recent attacks on police and shows of force by officers have unnerved some now protesting as well. Cori Bush, a registered nurse who became a leader of the protests in Ferguson, Missouri, after an officer shot a black teenager there, said “things will get much worse before they get better.” Bush said she expects police to be emboldened by Trump’s calls to crush unrest. “I worry tonight, the police will be taking action even harder,” she said.

That a man they saw as a “gentle giant” who brought positivity everywhere he went would turn up dead in an alley after a peaceful demonstration turned violent was unfathomable. “He promoted peace and understanding and love every way that he could,” said Michael Cranfill, a restaurant and craft beer taproom owner. “He is someone, I think, who would take every opportunity he could to bring people together.” Beaty’s body was found Saturday night not far from his apartment, one of two people fatally shot after violence erupted during an Indianapolis protest. The death of the man who was known as Mr. Indianapolis because of his unwavering support and enthusiasm for the city was just one of several in the U.S. during protest and unrest since Floyd died May 25 after a white Minneapolis officer pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes even after the handcuffed black man stopped moving and pleading for air. Others slain include a Louisville, Kentucky, restaurant owner who was shot by authorities trying to disperse a crowd; a federal officer in Oakland, California, who was shot at a courthouse by someone in a passing vehicle; and a man shot outside a pawn shop in Minneapolis. Police in Indianapolis did not release details Tuesday of Beaty’s slaying. Arely Elrod said she met Beaty about a decade ago through mutual friends who would attend local events together. “He was so selfless and always so positive,” said Elrod, who owns a cleaning service. “He felt like there was always a need in a time of hatred. He was always the one to make sure he made a difference.” Beaty, 38, graduated from Indianapolis Cathedral High School and played defensive lineman at Indiana University from 2000 to 2004. Since then, he had become a business owner in Indianapolis. “The news of the passing of Chris Beaty is just devastating,” Indiana head football coach Tom Allen said in a statement. “Since I returned home to coach at Indiana, Chris embraced me, encouraged me and supported me! His passion for life and Indiana Football energized me every time we were together.” The school said Beaty had been president of Fresh Marketing LLC. A May 4 post on Beaty’s Facebook page said that he and his team had created a reusable and washable cloth facemask with a filter for people to use during the coronavirus pandemic. “As the realization that life is changing set in from sitting on the couch during quarantine, I figured out a way to be proactive and help people during these COVID-19 times,” the post read. “If you’re going back to work and looking for a solution to your ‘new normal’ please keep us in mind.” Beaty also owned and operated nightclubs and recently sold some of his businesses, said Cranfill, who added that when he opened his own restaurant in downtown Indianapolis Beaty asked how they could work together to grow the community. “He was a gentle giant, the kind of guy that would just draw you in with his energy,” said Cranfill, 37. “He had the most amazing smile, would give you a big hug. He exuded care for his community — someone who brought everyone together.” Cranfill called Beaty a leader, not just for African Americans in the community, but for all of Indianapolis. “I prayed and said, ‘Let his memory be the unifying moment to stop this violence, for us to come together, lay down our differences and for people to begin to heal and hear each other,’” Cranfill said.

Twenty-three people were arrested Monday night on misdemeanor charges during what has so far been the largest protest against police brutality in Maine. The Cumberland County Sheriff's Office says out of the arrests, all but two were charged with failure to disperse and released on unsecured bail bonds. The protest, organized by a Portland man who identifies as a member of the group Black Lives Matter, drew an estimated 1,000 people into the Old Port area of Portland Monday night, just one week after 46-year-old George Floyd died in Minneapolis as a police officer knelt on his neck, despite his cries that he couldn't breathe. The now-former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin has since been charged with manslaughter and murder. The other three officers involved have yet to be charged. Protesters around the nation have cried out for justice since Floyd's death. Since then, police departments from Augusta to Portland and from Bangor to Brunswick have expressed ""disgust"" at the killing and even marched with the protesters.

Tuesday morning, the Facebook group BLM Portland posted about Monday's protest: ""Last night PPD proved, as though there were ever any doubt, that police brutality and systemic violence are as deeply rooted here, as they are in any city across the country. While aggressing on protesters, shooting tear gas and rubber pellets, they made upwards of 20 arrests. BLM Portland organizers were on the ground and at the jail to ensure the safe release of those arrested. At 5:45 a[.m.], all protesters we released and their bail waived."" Machar said she spent much of early Tuesday at the Cumberland County Jail, making sure those arrested were ok and had a ride home. She said that as she drove several of those arrested back to their homes, she questioned them about the event and tried to thank them, but that she could tell from their lack of awareness that they were actually protest, and she noted some were intoxicated. She said she heard people she didn't know talking about looting and then laughing, and she told them, ""That's not what we're here for."" At one point, she said she stepped between a tall, white man and an officer to diffuse a confrontation. ""I thought, 'If another Black body comes here, and is not female and is Black and is taller than me, this aggression is going to lead to something that devastates an entire community."" Machar said she is angry that the people who publicized the protest left prior to the escalation later in the evening, and no one remained to take care of younger members of the community—including one 14-year-old girl who was carried home by her brother after getting pepper spray in her veil, Machar said.

Dr. Nirav Shah, director of the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said at an afternoon media briefing that large crowds are a risk factor but no cases have yet been connected to protests in Maine. In addition to Monday’s protest, there also have been several demonstrations in recent weeks against Gov. Janet Mills’ reopening plan, which has limited business activity to reduce the risk of spreading COVID-19, the disease caused by he coronavirus. Shah said it could take days or weeks before cases emerge that could be linked to the protests. It was about a week after a packed Lake of the Ozarks pool party on Memorial Day weekend in Missouri that a positive case of COVID-19 was detected in a partygoer, according to news reports. “Close congregate settings can generate a high number of cases in a short amount of time,” Shah said. “Just because we haven’t yet detected any outbreaks of that nature is really more a sign of not enough time has elapsed yet.” The CDC reported Tuesday that 60 more people have recovered from COVID-19, and the number of active cases declined. Overall, there have been 2,377 cases in Maine since the pandemic began. With a total of 1,646 recoveries and 94 deaths, the number of active cases stood at 637, down from 674 on Monday. Protests against police brutality against black Americans have taken place in Maine following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis, generating increasingly large crowds. About 1,000 people protested in downtown Portland on Monday night, many packed shoulder-to-shoulder. Many were not wearing masks. “I would ask everyone who is going out there in any circumstance to please wear a face covering and if possible maintain as much physical distance between one person and another,” Shah said. “In any event, the more people wearing face coverings, whatever the situation, overall the less likelihood of transmission there is.” Gov. Janet Mills’ executive order currently prohibits gatherings of more than 50 people. Jeanne Lambrew, health and human services commissioner, said protests should be limited to 50 people or fewer. “We know it’s harder to do that kind of physical distancing (staying 6 feet apart) when you exceed 50 people gathering,” Lambrew said. Outrage over police brutality flared after former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin was caught in a bystander’s video kneeling on the neck of Floyd, 46, whom they had taken into custody. Police said he matched the description of someone who passed a counterfeit $20 bill inside a convenience store. Chauvin – who has been arrested and charged with third-degree murder in Floyd’s death on May 25 – pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck for nearly 9 minutes as Floyd said he could not breathe. Floyd lost consciousness and was pronounced dead a short time later at a nearby hospital. The three other officers who stood by and watched were fired but have not been charged. Protesters in downtown Portland held a “die-in,” lying face down on the ground and chanting, “I can’t breathe.” In addition to concerns over protest crowd sizes, Maine is entering tourist season, and even if not as many people are vacationing this summer, Maine could still get a flood of tourists from COVID-19 hot spots such as Massachusetts, New York and New Jersey. Traditionally, crowds have packed into Portland’s Old Port, Bar Harbor, Acadia National Park, Fort Williams, Old Orchard Beach and many other favorite tourist destinations. Reopening continues The five COVID-19 deaths reported Tuesday included two women and a man in their 70s from Cumberland County, a man in his 60s from Penobscot County and a woman in her 100s from Cumberland County. The latest case numbers paint a mixed picture as reopening continues. Testing and contact tracing have been greatly expanded, increasing the state’s ability to contain the virus’ spread. Forty-eight Mainers are currently hospitalized with COVID-19, unchanged from Monday. Among those, 16 are in critical care and 10 are using ventilators to support their breathing, roughly the same numbers as Monday. The state has 156 available intensive care unit beds at hospitals and 245 available ventilators. Hospitalization rates and death trends are key metrics for tracking the progress of the virus and efforts to contain transmission. Intensive care beds and ventilators are critical tools for treating hospitalized patients, and epidemiologists closely monitor the demand for these resources as they study the spread of the disease. The rate of positive tests out of the total – another key metric that shows how effective the state is at finding COVID-19 cases and then tracking close contacts and isolating people to prevent further spread – dipped below 5 percent for the first time Tuesday, to 4.95 percent out of 57,635 total tests. The goal, Shah has said, is to drive down the positivity rate to the 2-3 percent range, similar to South Korea, which has an effective tracing and testing program. Maine’s positivity rate has hovered around 5 percent, but was closer to 6 percent about two weeks ago. When Maine expanded testing, the positivity rate started to decline. Shah said that expanded testing has found more cases of asymptomatic people who have COVID-19, and those people are then isolated. If the state can find asymptomatic COVID-19 carriers, Shah said, that is an effective way to prevent transmission, because if people don’t know they are contagious, they are more likely to engage with others and spread the virus. Also on Tuesday, the Maine DHHS launched the “Keep it Maine” campaign to encourage Mainers to follow physical distancing guidelines, hygiene and other ways to keep Maine among the lowest rates of COVID-19 in the nation. Maine has the eighth-lowest number of positive cases per capita in the country, and it is spending $250,000 in federal funding on the outreach campaign. “We stay the course and we work together to do what’s right for our loved ones, friends and neighbors,” Lambrew said in a statement. “The campaign’s theme is built around this shared achievement. Let’s keep it up. Let’s keep it Maine.” On Monday, the state dropped the distinction between essential and nonessential businesses, which means all retail stores can now open, with customer limits based on square footage and other restrictions. Parks, beaches, lodging places and campgrounds also may open to patrons, provided they’re Maine residents or out-of-staters who have quarantined for two weeks. Restaurants in Cumberland, York and Androscoggin County are permitted to open for outdoor dining, but will have to wait longer before allowing patrons inside. Mills has not set a date and that uncertainty has led to criticism from the restaurant industry. Lambrew said on Tuesday that no decisions have been made on a new date for indoor dining for those three counties. Previously established restrictions on public transportation remain in place and should be used for essential purposes only. Restrictions on certain gatherings, including religious services, have increased from 10 to 50. The governor’s mandatory 14-day quarantine for out-of-state visitors remains in place, even amid legal challenges and as many in the hospitality industry have called on Mills to drop it. She has said she is looking at all options but has not found a safe alternative.

A total of 35 properties were impacted, according to Portland Police. ""It's coming off hard but we'll get it,"" Johnny DiFiore said as he scrubbed red spray paint off one building. He and others spent the day scouring walls, pressure washing granite steps, and boarding up windows across the city. Old Port Spirits & Cigars was one of the hardest hit after rogue protesters shattered a window and broke into the store and attempted to steal liquor. ""I was hurt.

""We're all in the same storm, just in different sized boats."" Twenty-three people were arrested by police Monday night.

RELATED: Protest organizers: 'We're here for the long haul' Chief Frank Clark, who still has yet to meet with activists as they have been demanding, released a detailed account of the incident Tuesday with the following statement: “As I’ve said before, the City of Portland and the Portland Police Department respects the rights of those who wish to protest. We understand and are also disgusted by the recent tragedy. Our goal remains providing a safe environment for those wishing to peacefully express their views and First Amendment rights. We are fortunate that no one was seriously injured and that most of the property damage was minimal. Unfortunately a committed smaller segment of this group ended up making this event anything other than a peaceful and lawful protest. They took the opportunity to commit acts of violence, damage public and private property and place my officers and the public at risk. We will not stand for such criminal behavior.” RELATED: Portland Police Chief speaks out about protests ""We just want to be heard,"" protest organizer Saja Bol said. Bol and a group of self-proclaimed 'Black Lives Matter' activists have been leading the mostly peaceful events every night. She told NEWS CENTER Maine she does not condone violence or destruction. ""It does give us a bad rap for us who are peacefully protesting. But in the same breath they're mad. And I understand they're mad,"" Bol said. ""I'm mad, but we can't stoop to that level.""

Things seemed to begin to escalate again Tuesday evening after organizers urged people to peacefully go home after ending the demonstration at 9 p.m. A smaller group didn't, though, and marched back to the Portland Police station. They were met with police again in riot gear. Around midnight on Tuesday police addressed the crowd of about 100 remaining protestors and said they are attending an 'illegal gathering' and that if they didn't disperse they are subject to arrest. A handful did leave, but most remained. Police began ordering people to disperse around 10:30 p.m. and said people will be arrested if they don't. Police began using disperse tactics. About 200 protestors with disjointed missions remain outside of the police department. Some set off firecrackers, and others urged them to remain peaceful. A crowd of around 200 people has now gathered in front of the Portland Police Department. Some people are setting off fire works.

They made stops at Monument Square, the Eastern Promenade, and the Portland Police station. The protestors chanted, marched, and did 'die-ins' demonstrations, where the group lies down on the ground with their hands behind their backs, as Floyd did for more than eight minutes. The protests come just one week after 46-year-old George Floyd died in Minneapolis as a police officer knelt on his neck, despite his cries that he couldn't breathe. The now-former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin has since been charged with manslaughter and murder. The other three officers involved have yet to be charged. Protesters around the nation have cried out for justice since Floyd's death. Since then, police departments from Augusta to Portland and from Bangor to Brunswick have expressed ""disgust"" at the killing and even marched with the protesters. On Tuesday, officers kneeled with protestors in support on the steps of the Portland Police station. Protestors are urging for a peaceful protest, which has been the message throughout all protests here in Maine, however, things did escalate Monday night as tensions flared with police in riot gear. On Monday Police in riot gear responded to a handful of instigators throwing things their way with pepper spray, pepper balls, and other push-back tactics. All told, police made 23 arrests Monday, but all have been released at no bail. ""It's not a fight against police, it's a fight against racism."" Those were just a few of the eloquent words spoken by an organizer, Devin Moore, at Tuesday's protest in Portland. Moore and other organizers continue to urge non-violent and peaceful protesting. ""It kills me when the violence drowns out the message of why we’re out here in the first place,"" Moore said.

In his role as coach, Stevens has witnessed Brown go from a 19 year old drafted after one season playing in college to 20-point scorer in the NBA. Off the court, Stevens has seen Brown become a leader who is unafraid of using his voice to address important issues in society. So when Brown told his coach last Thursday that he was going to drive to Atlanta and help lead a Sunday protest over the killing of George Floyd, Stevens was hardly surprised. “Jaylen’s greatest impact, as good as he is at basketball, won’t be in basketball,’’ said Stevens during a Wednesday morning video conference with the media. “I just think he’s a special guy. He’s a special leader. He’s smart, but he has courage. He’s got a lot of great stuff to him. “I think we recognized that when we drafted him, but he has been even more unbelievable every day, every year. I’ve always personally really enjoyed listening to him and talking to him about things outside of basketball. He told me he was going down there on Thursday and I certainly am not surprised by him taking a leadership role. That’s who he is.’’ Brown was joined by Indiana Pacers guard Malcolm Brogdon at the rally in Atlanta, not far from Brown’s hometown of Marietta, Georgia. After driving 15 hours from Boston to Atlanta, Brown marched in a large crowd to protest the death of Floyd, who died having his neck pinned to the ground by the knee of Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin. While Brown was in Georgia, teammates Marcus Smart, Enes Kanter and Vincent Poirier were in Boston participating in a protest. “I don’t think it’s a great surprise that our guys are able to lead with such great courage,’’ said Stevens, “because they put themselves out there every day in kind of a meaningless game when you think about it. “I’ve said this many times. I think the NBA’s amazing and I think our players are amazing. We’re lucky that we have such great people representing us with the Celtics. I couldn’t be more proud to be in the NBA, to be with the Celtics and be surrounded by the people I get to go to work with every day.’’ The NBA is getting close to making plans to restart the season, perhaps in late July, and Celtics players started showing up at the Auerbach Center Monday for voluntary workouts. But Stevens said the focus is not on basketball with everything that is going on in the country, including the protests and the violence that has erupted after the death of Floyd. Stevens said that he wrote to his players over the weekend. “Extreme sadness,’’ said Stevens. “A lot of people feel the pain and it transfers to anger. I wrote a letter to our guys this weekend. It took me a while to put down exactly what I wanted to say. “I think the thing I wanted them to know is that every decent person is hurting. Every decent person feels the pain of the African-American community. But I also don’t want to pretend I know the exact distinct pain. What I wanted them to know is I’m with them.’’ There are 11 African-American players on the Celtics’ 15-man roster, and Stevens said that he knows the responsibility he has in these difficult times. “We were on a coaches call with all 30 coaches the other day,’’ said Stevens. “One thing I heard from a number of coaches was that as white coaches, we have a lot of responsibility here. “We may not be able to know the depth of the pain of our colleagues that are black, or our players that are black, our assistants that our black. But we have a responsibility to be not only empathetic but help drive change. “We have all been in these conversations before and you’re moved to drive change and sometimes actionable steps lead to what you think is progress but this sure doesn’t look like progress.’’ Stevens said that he sat in meetings with Celtics players four years ago when NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick was kneeling during the national anthem to protest social injustice. “From those three weeks of training camp, being able to sit in those meetings, being able to listen to our guys, I think that gave me a whole new understanding of just how much change is needed,’’ said Stevens. “At that time as an organization, we tried to make sure we were trying to do our part to create actionable steps. But there’s no question everybody’s got to do more. “The pain everybody feels has been there for a long, long time. The lack of progress is too jarring.’’",0.0

John Hubbard signs what becomes known as the Maine Law, which bans the sale of alcoholic beverages except for “medicinal, mechanical, or manufacturing purposes.” The law, for which Portland Mayor Neal Dow lobbied furiously, also includes a search-and-seizure provision that enables any three voters to obtain a search warrant if they suspect someone of selling liquor. The bill’s enactment prompts some to nickname Dow the “the Napoleon of Temperance,” but it also earns him many enemies. Dow travels for three years after that as a temperance crusader in other states and Canada. Versions of the Maine Law are enacted in Indiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Rhode Island and Vermont. Maine’s groundbreaking prohibition law engenders the Portland Rum Riot on June 2, 1855, in which one person dies and several are injured, leading to the law’s repeal in 1856. Later, similar bills become law, however, and prohibition is added to the state constitution in 1884. The Rum Riots and their legislative aftermath foreshadow the national debate over Prohibition in the early 20th century. June 2, 2017: Augusta City Center, the city’s principal government building, closes unexpectedly early when an unhappy visitor dumps a cup full of about 100 live bedbugs on a counter about 2 p.m. in one of the offices. The city evacuates the building and summons an insect-control specialist. Officials said the bug carrier came to City Center to seek General Assistance money. When he was told he didn’t qualify, they said, he unleashed the bugs. Weeks later, police charge a 74-year-old city resident with assault and obstruction of government administration in connection with the incident.

An estimated 350 people from many different backgrounds gathered in Ellsworth and their message was clear: “Black lives matter.” Tuesday’s protest continues a trend of frustration with police brutality and most recently the death of George Floyd while in the custody of the Minneapolis Police Department seen around Maine and throughout the country. In Ellsworth, protesters marched up Main Street before convening in front of City Hall, where speakers expressed their frustrations with police and community relations while members of the town’s police department looked on. While much of the frustration was focused toward systemic racism and the negative experiences of minorities in general, one individual, who moved to Ellsworth from Los Angeles spoke at length about his specific negative experiences with Ellsworth police officers. The protest as a whole was civil and the Ellsworth Police Department called the event “peaceful.” One of the few points of contention revolved around the protesters asking the officers overlooking the protest to take a knee in solidarity with them, as was asked of officers in Bangor and Portland this week. Ellsworth officers chose not to kneel. Chief Glenn Moshier told the crowd they were going to remain independent from the protest while protecting the event. Another protest in the town is expected later in the week.",0.0

The sun was out, the skies were brilliant blue and the temperature was perfect for yardwork. A wonderful old saying, “many hands make light work,” was certainly the case – though we really didn’t “work.” We gathered as a family, laughing, joking, catching up with each other, marveling at how fast the little ones are growing, and paying homage to our shared heritage.

And when it was time to leave, nobody really wanted to part. It wasn’t until I left that I learned a peaceful protest in downtown Pittsburgh had gone violent. The Trib reported the “planned peaceful protest was spurred by the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis on May 25. Video of the incident showed at least one police officer kneeling on Floyd’s neck as he cried that he could not breathe. Floyd was black, and the officers involved were white.” That video is difficult to watch. Why the barbaric tactic of kneeling on a man’s throat, when he was clearly cuffed and already detained? Bystanders pleaded with the officer to remove his knee from Floyd’s neck as Floyd pleaded he could not breathe. Protesters have every right to demand answers – to demand change – and they were protesting peacefully in Pittsburgh until violence was sparked. “The floodgates opened and protests turned violent about 4:30 p.m. Saturday, police said, indicating that it all started with ‘the vandalism and ultimate burning of a marked Pittsburgh Police vehicle,’” according to the Trib. “More specifically, a man dressed in all black began spray-painting the cruiser, then jumped on the hood and broke the windows.” Who was he? A young white male from the suburbs – allegedly, Brian Jordan Bartels, 20, of Shaler – clearly more interested in wreaking havoc and creating mayhem than in calling attention to the protesters’ cause. The Trib reported that police wrote, “A black female from the crowd stepping in front of Bartels and pleaded for him to stop. He gave her the finger and then jumped on the car hood and stomped the windshield.” The little twit. It was young fellows just like him who caused violence at such protests across the country – causing mass destruction and the death of at least one security guard. These young men could have done something positive last Saturday, such as helping their aging grandparents tend to their landscaping. They could have protested peacefully, written letters to the editor, informed friends on social media of things each of us can do to create needed change, or promoted political candidates who will work to prevent deaths like Floyd’s from ever occurring again. They could have done many positive things to effect change, but they did the opposite. Bringing many positive hands together is the way to make light work of effecting change – that is where the focus should be.

Many cities across the U.S. have enacted curfews, such as in Los Angeles where the curfew is the harshest since the riots in 1992, and New York City has announced its strictest curfew since 1943. SEATTLE — Leaders in Seattle seeking to address concerns raised by protesters have abruptly ended a city-wide curfew in place for days amid massive demonstrations against the death of George Floyd while in police custody in Minnesota.Mayor Jenny Durkan said Wednesday evening on Twitter that she was ending the curfew, which had been scheduled to last until Saturday, after she and Police Chief Carmen Best met with community members.“Chief Best believes we can balance public safety and ensure peaceful protests can continue without a curfew,” Durkan said. “For those peacefully demonstrating tonight, please know you can continue to demonstrate. We want you to continue making your voice heard.”Thousands of protesters remained in the city’s Capitol Hill neighborhood well after the abolished 9 p.m. curfew Wednesday. Demonstrators carried “Black Lives Matter” signs, called for cutting the police department’s budget and shifting the money to social programs, and chanted for officers to remove their riot gear.Washington Lt. Gov. Cyrus Habib tweeted that he was pleased Seattle had listened and reversed course.“Preemptive curfews were only making things worse. Other cities should do likewise,” he posted.WASHINGTON — Demonstrators marched to the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday night, protesting the death of George Floyd in Minnesota and demanding that laws be changed to prevent more like it.Along their route from near the White House, there were troops in fatigues and officers from federal agencies keeping watch on the crowd. Barricades were put up around the Capitol, and the Capitol Police stood guard behind them.“We came here because they make laws here and we want the laws to change,” said Mohammed Wagdy, 26, of nearby Prince George’s County.As an 11 p.m. curfew in Washington neared, community activists urged the demonstrators to head home. Some did, but others said they were returning to the White House. Minneapolis — A full autopsy of George Floyd, the handcuffed black man who died after being restrained by Minneapolis police, was released Wednesday and provides several clinical details, including that Floyd had tested positive for COVID-19.The 20-page report released by the Hennepin County Medical Examiner’s Office came with the family’s permission and after the coroner’s office released summary findings Monday that Floyd had a heart attack while being restrained by officers, and classified his May 25 death as a homicide.The report by Chief Medical Examiner Andrew Baker spelled out clinical details, including that Floyd tested positive for COVID-19 on April 3 but appeared asymptomatic. The report also noted Floyd’s lungs appeared healthy but he had some narrowing of arteries in the heart.The county’s earlier summary report listed fentanyl intoxication and recent methamphetamine use under “other significant conditions” but not under “cause of death.” The full report’s footnotes noted that signs of fentanyl toxicity can include “severe respiratory depression” and seizures.--------------------All of the former Minneapolis Police officers charged in connection with the death of George Floyd are now in custody.

In all, nine states and the District of Columbia held elections, including four that delayed their April contests because of the coronavirus outbreak. With no real competition, Biden and President Trump easily won their respective primary elections in Indiana, Rhode Island, Maryland, New Mexico and the night’s biggest prize: Pennsylvania. Biden also won South Dakota. Voters waited in long lines that brushed up against curfews in Washington, D.C., and Philadelphia, two cities rocked by protests following the police killing of George Floyd. Officials in both places said voters wouldn’t be arrested for breaking curfew, but thousands of protesters defied the mayors’ orders at the same time, setting up a potential clash with law enforcement agencies and National Guard troops patrolling the streets during a fifth night of social unrest. Pennsylvania, which offered the day’s biggest trove of delegates, also represented a significant test case for Republicans and Democrats working to strengthen their operations in a premier general election battleground. Voters were forced to brave long lines in “militarized zones” because officials consolidated the vast majority of polling places in Philadelphia to minimize health risks, according to Erin Kramer, executive director of One Pennsylvania. She noted that some polling places in African American communities are in police stations. “Having to stand in line while police officers are entering and exiting the building on police business is not exactly how people want to spend their election day,” Kramer said. Biden was on the primary ballot in almost every state in his bid to unify Democrats behind his campaign against Trump. The former vice president is already the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, given that all his rivals have dropped out of the race, but he needs to win 89 percent of all delegates at stake on Tuesday to formally clinch the nomination. If he doesn’t secure the needed delegates Tuesday, he has other opportunities to do so this month. Biden was in Philadelphia on Tuesday morning to deliver remarks about the civil unrest that has erupted across the nation. He didn’t talk about the primary, instead focusing his attention on Trump, whom Biden blasted as “more interested in power than in principle.” Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is not actively campaigning, having suspended his operation and endorsed Biden, but his name will appear on the ballots. On the eve of Tuesday’s primaries, senior adviser Jeff Weaver encouraged progressives to vote for Sanders anyway. “People who support Bernie Sanders and his agenda, who want to maximize the influence of progressives at the convention, should cast their vote for Bernie Sanders,” Weaver said, reminding voters that the Vermont senator is seeking leverage to shape the party’s platform and rules. The comments serve as a reminder that Biden may have no legitimate Democratic rivals remaining but must still win over skeptical activists from his party’s far-left flank, who worry he’s too close to the political establishment.

The coronavirus death toll has surged past 100,000 nationwide, and thousands of new cases are reported each day. At the same time, several major cities, including some voting Tuesday, are grappling with protests. Some voters said Trump’s increasingly tough tone toward protesters inspired them to participate in the democratic process. Nicholas Autiello, who works in finance in Rhode Island, said he was disturbed by police driving back peaceful demonstrators near the White House on Monday. “Last night, we have a president who is acting like a dictator,” Autiello said. “So being able to come out here this morning and fill in a circle next to a name for someone who I know will restore honor and decency to the presidency was so important.” Political groups have had to adjust as some states move to a system that relies largely on voting by mail.

1624259112,2020-06-02 19:36:38,D.C. officials push back on aggressive response to protests,https://www.centralmaine.com/2020/06/02/d-c-officials-push-back-on-aggressive-response-to-protests/,en,False,politics and government,29592,onlinesentinel.com,http://www.onlinesentinel.com#spider,"WASHINGTON — Officials in the nation’s capital pushed back Tuesday on an aggressive response by the federal government to demonstrations over the death of George Floyd, with the mayor flatly rejecting a Trump administration proposal for the federal government to take over its police force and one county in Virginia pulling its officers from Washington. The federal government has deployed law enforcement officials from numerous agencies, and National Guard troops from a number of states have been sent to the District of Columbia. Attorney General William Barr, who is directing the federal law enforcement response in the city, promised by Tuesday “even greater law enforcement resources and support in the region.” District of Columbia Mayor Muriel Bowser said the Trump administration floated the idea of taking over the Metropolitan Police Department, a proposal she strongly rejected. She threatened to take legal action if the federal government attempted to do so. But there were signs that the federal response would be even more aggressive Tuesday night, as Washington prepared for a fifth night of protests. Hours before a 7 p.m. curfew for the second night in a row, cars were being stopped at military checkpoints in downtown Washington and a cavalry of armored military vehicles could be seen driving through the district. Businesses were boarding up windows with plywood in anticipation of another night of violence after fires were set, windows were shattered, store shelves were emptied and dozens of police officers were injured in days of protests. Two Defense Department officials said the Trump administration had ordered military aircraft to fly above Washington on Monday night as a “show of force” against demonstrators protesting the death of Floyd, a black man who died after a white Minneapolis policeman pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes even after Floyd stopped moving and pleading for air. Police made over 300 arrests, mainly for violating the district’s curfew. Earlier Monday evening, law enforcement officers on foot and horseback moved aggressively to clear protesters away from Lafayette Park near the White House in advance of President Trump’s walk to a nearby church for a photo opportunity. After participating in the show of force, Arlington County in Virginia pulled out its officers, saying they were used “for a purpose not worthy of our mutual aid obligations.” County Board Chair Libby Garvey said on Twitter she’s “appalled” that the mutual aid agreement was abused “for a photo op.” In a phone interview, Garvey said the aid request came from U.S. Park Police, and that the agencies have aided each other routinely over the years. She said Arlington Police had helped in Washington on Saturday and Sunday without incident. Arlington County officials said in a statement their officers never wielded their batons and did not fire rubber bullets or tear gas. But after watching the scene unfold on live television, the police chief ordered all the officers to return to Virginia. “This unprecedented decision by the County was a necessary response to an unprecedented situation,” the statement said. Officials said they were re-evaluating the mutual aid agreements to ensure officers “are never again put in a situation where they are asked to take action that is inconsistent with our values.” The U.S. Park Police on Tuesday defended its actions at the park, saying it issued three warnings over a loudspeaker before clearing the area of protesters, some of whom they said were becoming violent, throwing projectiles and trying to grab weapons. It said it used smoke canisters and pepper balls to disperse the crowd. Barr ordered law enforcement officials to clear the park and push back the perimeter around the White House when he arrived there Monday evening, ahead of the president’s remarks, leading to police using force to disperse protesters, a person familiar with the matter told the AP. Officials had met Monday morning and decided the perimeter had to be moved by at least one full block, which was expected to happen by Monday afternoon, after multiple fires were set in the park the night before, the person said. When Barr arrived, he was surprised it hadn’t been done and directed action to be taken, according to the person, who could not discuss the matter publicly and spoke to AP on condition of anonymity. Monday, in a call with governors, Trump and Barr had encouraged more aggressive action against those who cause violence during protests across the country. The call raised questions about whether using more aggressive law enforcement measures against demonstrators protesting police brutality would only increase tensions. Trump said he was “taking immediate presidential action to stop the violence and restore security and safety in America.” The president urged governors to deploy the National Guard, which he credited with helping calm the situation Sunday night in Minneapolis, and demanded that similarly tough measures be taken in cities that also experienced spasms of violence, including New York, Philadelphia and Los Angeles. “Mayors and governors must establish an overwhelming law enforcement presence until the violence has been quelled,” Trump said. Between the protests and the response to the coronavirus pandemic, the National Guard has been deployed at its highest level in recent history, surpassing the number of troops sent to the Gulf Coast during Hurricane Katrina in 2005. More than 66,700 soldiers and airman have been activated — 45,000 to assist with the pandemic and more than 17,000 to help with the protests. The federal government has provided all affected states with a list of National Guard resources available to them, a White House official said. The official added that Trump’s message to governors was if they don’t utilize all of the tools in their arsenal they shouldn’t expect a sympathetic response from Washington if they request federal dollars to help with clean-up and recovery down the line. The official could not discuss the matter publicly and spoke to AP on condition of anonymity. Other law enforcement resources are also being mobilized in Washington. The Justice Department had deployed agents from every one of its agencies, including the FBI’s Hostage Rescue Team, an elite tactical unit, and riot teams from the Bureau of Prisons. The U.S. Park Police and Secret Service have had dozens of officers out in riot gear in Washington for the last few nights, in addition to the Metropolitan Police Department. U.S. Customs and Border Protection and other Homeland Security agencies were also dispatched. Most of the protesters have been peaceful and tried to discourage violence. Trump, Barr and others have tried to blame some of the civil unrest on left-wing extremist groups, including antifa, and other “anarchists.” Short for anti-fascists, antifa is an umbrella term for far-left-leaning militant groups that resist neo-Nazis and white supremacists at demonstrations. The Justice Department has vowed to treat the “violence instigated and carried out by antifa & other similar groups” as domestic terrorism. Although there isn’t a specific federal domestic terrorism statute, prosecutors could charge other offenses and seek enhanced sentencing. The U.S. military and National Guard are operating in Washington under the official mission name Operation Themis, according to two Pentagon officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to do so publicly. In Greek mythology, Themis was a titaness of divine law and order, whose symbols are the scales of justice. Army Lt. Col. Chris Mitchell, a Pentagon spokesperson, said they were not aware of the operational name but said it’s possible. Send questions/comments to the editors. « Previous Next »",0.0

Ben Sasse. South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, the only black Republican in the Senate, said he did not think Trump’s visit to St. John’s Church was helpful. “Obviously, if your question is, should you use tear gas to clear a path so the president can go have a photo-op, the answer is no,” Scott told Politico Tuesday, while noting he did not personally see the incident. Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, said it was “painful to watch peaceful protestors be subjected to tear gas in order for the president to go across the street to a church that I believe he’s attended only once.” While Americans are justifiably upset that the historic church was set on fire and vandalized, “I thought that the president came across as unsympathetic and insensitive,” she said. At a time when a president “ought to be trying to calm the nation,″ Trump did not do that, said Collins, who is running for re-election and is considered one of the Senate’s most vulnerable incumbents. Sasse, who has at times criticized Trump but won his endorsement for re-election, said public officials nationwide “should be lowering the temperature” over protests and violence following the death in police custody of George Floyd, an unarmed black man, in Minnesota. Four Minneapolis police officers have been fired and one has been charged with murder in Floyd’s death. “Police injustice – like the evil murder of George Floyd – is repugnant and merits peaceful protest aimed at change,” Sasse said, adding that “riots are abhorrent acts of violence that hurt the innocent.” Both messages should be heard as Americans work to end violence and injustice, Sasse said. The comments by the three GOP senators were among the strongest by Republicans following Trump’s demand Monday to end the heated protests and his vow to use military force to achieve that if necessary. Republicans have frequently muted any criticism of Trump, and only GOP Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah voted in favor of Trump’s impeachment in February. After Trump’s hardline speech Monday in the White House Rose Garden, the president walked to nearby St. John’s Church, where he held up a Bible for photographers. Trump’s actions drew widespread condemnation from Democrats and religious leaders who said he was misusing the Bible and the church where presidents have prayed for more than 150 years. South Dakota Sen. John Thune, the second-ranking GOP senator, said that “as a general matter, I always think it’s a good thing for our elected leaders to be spending time at church.” Still, Thune said views of Trump’s actions were “going to be in the eye of the beholder. His supporters are going to think … he was standing up for the things he believes in and they believe in. His detractors are going to say it was a photo op.” Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, said Trump likely “thought this would be some unifying message, but of course it was for half the country, and the other half were outraged by it. And that’s just where we are, sadly.” On Trump’s threat to send in the military to quell violence, Cornyn and Thune said they hope Trump does not resort to that. While Trump “arguably” has the authority to use military force, “so far he hasn’t done it,” Cornyn said. “Hopefully, he won’t do it. It won’t be necessary. And we will try to bring some peace back to our communities.” Thune said he would “prefer that these things be handled by the state and local authorities. You want to de-escalate, rather than escalate.” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., declined to comment on Trump’s actions, but said he was relieved there were no deaths and few injuries in the nation’s capital Monday night. McConnell condemned rioting in his home city of Louisville and other cities, even as he said the nation is united in horror and opposition to Floyd’s death. “The legitimate and important voices of peaceful protesters will never be heard over the wailing of fire alarms, the smashing of plate-glass windows, and the sirens of ambulances coming for police officers who have been assaulted or shot in the head,” McConnell said. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said he was glad Trump went to a “historic church in our capital city that was firebombed by terrorists. It was important for the president to be there and say we will not be cowed by terrorists.

Earlier Monday evening, law enforcement officers on foot and horseback moved aggressively to clear protesters away from Lafayette Park near the White House in advance of President Trump’s walk to a nearby church for a photo opportunity. After participating in the show of force, Arlington County in Virginia pulled out its officers, saying they were used “for a purpose not worthy of our mutual aid obligations.” County Board Chair Libby Garvey said on Twitter she’s “appalled” that the mutual aid agreement was abused “for a photo op.” In a phone interview, Garvey said the aid request came from U.S. Park Police, and that the agencies have aided each other routinely over the years. She said Arlington Police had helped in Washington on Saturday and Sunday without incident. Arlington County officials said in a statement their officers never wielded their batons and did not fire rubber bullets or tear gas. But after watching the scene unfold on live television, the police chief ordered all the officers to return to Virginia. “This unprecedented decision by the County was a necessary response to an unprecedented situation,” the statement said. Officials said they were re-evaluating the mutual aid agreements to ensure officers “are never again put in a situation where they are asked to take action that is inconsistent with our values.” The U.S. Park Police on Tuesday defended its actions at the park, saying it issued three warnings over a loudspeaker before clearing the area of protesters, some of whom they said were becoming violent, throwing projectiles and trying to grab weapons. It said it used smoke canisters and pepper balls to disperse the crowd. Barr ordered law enforcement officials to clear the park and push back the perimeter around the White House when he arrived there Monday evening, ahead of the president’s remarks, leading to police using force to disperse protesters, a person familiar with the matter told the AP. Officials had met Monday morning and decided the perimeter had to be moved by at least one full block, which was expected to happen by Monday afternoon, after multiple fires were set in the park the night before, the person said. When Barr arrived, he was surprised it hadn’t been done and directed action to be taken, according to the person, who could not discuss the matter publicly and spoke to AP on condition of anonymity. Monday, in a call with governors, Trump and Barr had encouraged more aggressive action against those who cause violence during protests across the country. The call raised questions about whether using more aggressive law enforcement measures against demonstrators protesting police brutality would only increase tensions. Trump said he was “taking immediate presidential action to stop the violence and restore security and safety in America.” The president urged governors to deploy the National Guard, which he credited with helping calm the situation Sunday night in Minneapolis, and demanded that similarly tough measures be taken in cities that also experienced spasms of violence, including New York, Philadelphia and Los Angeles. “Mayors and governors must establish an overwhelming law enforcement presence until the violence has been quelled,” Trump said. Between the protests and the response to the coronavirus pandemic, the National Guard has been deployed at its highest level in recent history, surpassing the number of troops sent to the Gulf Coast during Hurricane Katrina in 2005. More than 66,700 soldiers and airman have been activated — 45,000 to assist with the pandemic and more than 17,000 to help with the protests. The federal government has provided all affected states with a list of National Guard resources available to them, a White House official said. The official added that Trump’s message to governors was if they don’t utilize all of the tools in their arsenal they shouldn’t expect a sympathetic response from Washington if they request federal dollars to help with clean-up and recovery down the line. The official could not discuss the matter publicly and spoke to AP on condition of anonymity. Other law enforcement resources are also being mobilized in Washington. The Justice Department had deployed agents from every one of its agencies, including the FBI’s Hostage Rescue Team, an elite tactical unit, and riot teams from the Bureau of Prisons. The U.S. Park Police and Secret Service have had dozens of officers out in riot gear in Washington for the last few nights, in addition to the Metropolitan Police Department. U.S. Customs and Border Protection and other Homeland Security agencies were also dispatched. Most of the protesters have been peaceful and tried to discourage violence. Trump, Barr and others have tried to blame some of the civil unrest on left-wing extremist groups, including antifa, and other “anarchists.” Short for anti-fascists, antifa is an umbrella term for far-left-leaning militant groups that resist neo-Nazis and white supremacists at demonstrations. The Justice Department has vowed to treat the “violence instigated and carried out by antifa & other similar groups” as domestic terrorism. Although there isn’t a specific federal domestic terrorism statute, prosecutors could charge other offenses and seek enhanced sentencing. The U.S. military and National Guard are operating in Washington under the official mission name Operation Themis, according to two Pentagon officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to do so publicly. In Greek mythology, Themis was a titaness of divine law and order, whose symbols are the scales of justice. Army Lt. Col. Chris Mitchell, a Pentagon spokesperson, said they were not aware of the operational name but said it’s possible. Send questions/comments to the editors. « Previous Next »",0.0

Mostly peaceful throughout the day, the demonstrators faced police officers, National Guard troops and other forces. President Trump called New York protesters ""lowlifes and losers,"" in a tweet posted Tuesday. Demonstrators throughout the country showed up, even in smaller towns such as Brattleboro, Vt., and Kingman, Ariz. Here are our updates on what is happening around the country: New York City Protesters gathered at places including the Barclays Center, Times Square and at the NYPD headquarters Tuesday, and daytime demonstrations were relatively peaceful. Tuesday was the first day for the citywide 8 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew, which will stay in effect until at least Sunday, the mayor announced. Trump called on the city to bring in the National Guard in a tweet. New York City put on an 11:00 P.M. CURFEW last night. No wonder they ripped the place apart. Should be 7:00 P.M. CALL UP THE NATIONAL GUARD. #SAVENYC — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 2, 2020 Mayor Bill de Blasio responded, ""Thank God we have not had a loss of life in these last 5 days, but you bring outside armed forces into an equation they are not trained for...that is a dangerous scenario."" Police cars and a helicopter converged on one group of marchers blocking an intersection on the Upper East Side around 9 p.m. Protesters chanted ""peaceful protest"" and held their arms up as officers dispersed the crowd. Marchers told NPR they joined the rally in part because of Floyd's death, but also because they're convinced officers around the country are targeting black men. Many businesses were boarded up to prevent a repeat of Monday night's looting. One business owner who stood outside his shop told NPR he was grateful for the heavy police presence. In Times Square, medical workers, who New York residents have cheered on throughout the coronavirus pandemic, came out to support demonstrations. Healthcare workers @sloan_kettering come out to cheer on and take a knee in support of protestors. The same people NYC has been honoring every night at 7pm now returning the support. pic.twitter.com/ezWpQtFdr0 — Katy Tur (@KatyTurNBC) June 2, 2020 According to a New York Times report, in Manhattan, where a majority of late-night ransacking has taken place in previous days, one group of protesters on their knees surrounded some police officers and chanted, ""Take a knee,"" but the officers didn't do it. Sea of protestors demanding cops take a knee, someone bangs on the police van and everyone jumps. Cops in the middle of a sea of protestors. pic.twitter.com/v7U7VcPNME — Sarah Maslin Nir (@SarahMaslinNir) June 2, 2020 Sizable crowds persisted in places such as the Barclays Center once the curfew passed, where a large group of demonstrators from that area left after curfew and crossed over the Manhattan Bridge. Crowd chanting”let us through” on Manhattan side of bridge pic.twitter.com/R0ieAttU74 — Amy Julia Harris (@amyjharris) June 3, 2020 Once those demonstrators who crossed the bridge attempted to exit and enter Manhattan, a standoff between hundreds of protesters and throngs of police officers took place. Officers blocked demonstrators from leaving, and protesters chanted ""Let us through!"" Los Angeles Angry residents called for Los Angeles Police Department Chief Michel Moore to resign following days of unrest over Floyd's death and multiple complaints of brutality by law enforcement. About 500 participants called to join a police commission meeting, causing connection delays. But after nearly an hour, with technical issues resolved, hundreds more residents were added. Many expressed outrage with Moore and said the department has met demonstrations with an excessive use of force with rubber bullets, tear gas, flash bangs and batons against peaceful and rioting demonstrators alike. Since Monday, Moore has drawn ire following remarks that protesters are ""capitalizing"" on the latest bouts of chaos, although he apologized on the Tuesday morning call, saying he ""misspoke."" ""We will investigate each complaint, and I promise to hold accountable anyone who violates our policy or commits other misconduct,"" Moore said, according to the LA Times. Moore noted there have been 13 officer-involved shootings since the start of the year. He added that more than 2,700 people have been arrested amid the protests — most for ""failure to disperse"" for curfew. Additionally, he said 27 LAPD personnel have been injured, including one hospitalized for a fractured skull and another for a broken knee. It is unclear how many protesters have been injured. Later in the day, more protesters gathered across the sprawling city, including in Hollywood, where armed National Guard members were stationed. About an hour before the countywide curfew went into effect, a massive column of demonstrators marched to Mayor Eric Garcetti's home in Hancock Park, a wealthy neighborhood lined with palm trees and mansions. ""I hear you that this isn't just about the criminal justice system. This is also about society and where we put our resources,"" Garcetti said in a news conference. ""I choose to listen and move forward, and bring this city together to build peace on our streets and in our neighborhoods,"" Garcetti said. ""George Floyd died in our America so that we may make sense of our future to make sure that we never see that again."" Hours past the curfew, demonstrators continued to flout orders to evacuate the streets. Washington, D.C. Large crowds showed up again a day after federal forces used tear gas and rubber bullets on peaceful demonstrators at Lafayette Square, across from the White House. Protesters on Tuesday in Washington, where there was also a primary election, were peaceful. The Washington Post and DCist reported that thousands demonstrated, surpassing Monday's crowd size. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., also joined demonstrators on Tuesday. National Guard troops, the U.S. Park Police and Department of Homeland Security officers stood inside a 7-foot metal fence that was put up overnight and surrounded the perimeter of Lafayette Square, as protesters clung to the outside. At sunset, hundreds lay on the ground face-down at the Capitol, emulating the position in which Minneapolis police held George Floyd before his death. As midnight neared, reporters said large crowds were still protesting peacefully, hours past the city's 7 p.m. curfew. This is a developing story. Some things reported by the media will later turn out to be wrong. We will focus on reports from officials and other authorities, credible news outlets and reporters who are at the scene. We will update as the situation develops. ",0.0

But interest in exerting that extraordinary federal authority appeared to be waning in the White House. Though the crackdown on the Washington demonstrations was praised by some Trump supporters Tuesday, a handful of Republicans expressed concern that law enforcement officers risked violating the protesters’ First Amendment rights. Trump’s defense secretary also distanced himself from Trump’s decision to walk across Lafayette Park for a photo opportunity at a church after the demonstrators had been cleared. Pentagon Chief Mark Esper, who walked with Trump to St. John’s Church on Monday evening, insisted he did not know the president’s destination. “I didn’t know where I was going,” Esper told NBC News. He said he had expected to view damage to a bathroom facility that had been vandalized in Lafayette Park, across from the White House, and talk with National Guard troops positioned there. Protests have sprung up following the death of George Floyd, a black man who died after a white Minneapolis police officer pinned him down and pressed Floyd’s neck with his knee. Violent demonstrations have raged in scores of American cities, a level of unrest unseen for decades. The situation in Washington escalated Monday, becoming a potent symbol of Trump’s policing tactics and a physical manifestation of the rhetorical culture war he has stoked since before he was elected. Nearly 30 minutes before a 7 p.m. curfew in Washington, U.S. Park Police repelled protesters with what they said were smoke canisters and pepper balls. “D.C. had no problems last night. Many arrests. Great job done by all. Overwhelming force. Domination,” Trump tweeted Tuesday, after a night in which heavily armed military forces and federal officers swarmed the city. Trump added, “(thank you President Trump!).” The clampdown followed a weekend of demonstrations outside the White House. Trump had been furious about images juxtaposing fires set in the park outside the executive mansion with a darkened White House in the background, according to current and former campaign and administration officials. He was also angry about the news coverage revealing he had been rushed to the White House bunker during Friday’s protests. In a Monday address in the Rose Garden, he called on governors to ramp up the National Guard presence to tamp down the protests. If they didn’t, Trump said, he would dispatch the military to their states — a step rarely taken in modern American history.

On Monday, 715 soldiers from the 82nd Airborne Division arrived in the capital area in case the situation in Washington escalated. They are stationed at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland and Fort Belvoir in Virginia. Two more 82nd Airborne battalions, totaling 1,300 soldiers, are on standby at Fort Bragg in North Carolina, according to documents reviewed by the AP. The plan is named Operation Themis. The soldiers on standby in the Washington area are armed and have riot gear and bayonets. After the AP first reported the issuing of bayonets Tuesday, orders came down that soldiers would not need the knife-like weapons that can be affixed to rifles, according to two soldiers from the 82nd who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear they would be punished for commenting publicly. The idea that bayonets could be used in confronting civilians provoked an outcry on social media and among some members of Congress. Administration officials were privately acknowledging that Monday’s events didn’t serve the administration well. Some Republican lawmakers, typically in lockstep with the president or at least refrain from publicly criticizing him, said Trump had gone too far in appearing to use force to clear the way for his visit to the church. “There is no right to riot, no right to destroy others’ property, and no right to throw rocks at police,” said Nebraska Republican Sen. Ben Sasse. “But there is a fundamental — a constitutional — right to protest, and I’m against clearing out a peaceful protest for a photo op that treats the Word of God as a political prop.” Former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, said of Trump posing for photos holding up a Bible, “I just wish he opened it once in a while.” It was Attorney General William Barr who gave the order for law enforcement to clear out the protest before Trump’s walk to the church ahead of Washington’s 7 p.m. curfew. A person familiar with the matter said the decision was made earlier Monday, but had not been executed by the time Barr arrived in Lafayette Park to survey the scene. He verbally gave the order at that time. After the demonstrators had been pushed out of the park, Trump emerged from the White House with several officials, including Esper and Gen. Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Senior defense officials told reporters Milley was also not aware that the Park Police and law enforcement had made a decision to clear the square or that Trump intended to visit the church. They had been in Washington to coordinate with federal law enforcement officials but were diverted to the White House to brief Trump on military preparations, the officials said.

In Athens, police fired tear gas to disperse youths who threw firebombs and stones at them outside the U.S. Embassy toward the end of an otherwise peaceful protest by about 4,000 people. No injuries or arrests were reported. The London demonstration began in Hyde Park, with protesters chanting “Black lives matter,” before many of them later marched through the streets, blocking traffic. Some of them converged on Parliament and the nearby Downing Street office of Prime Minister Boris Johnson. A few scuffles erupted between protesters and police outside the street’s heavy metal gates. Inside, Johnson told a news conference that he was “appalled and sickened” by Floyd’s death on May 25 when a white Minneapolis officer, Derek Chauvin, pressed his knee on the handcuffed black man’s neck for several minutes. Earlier, “Star Wars” actor John Boyega, who was born in Britain to Nigerian parents and grew up in south London’s Peckham neighborhood, pleaded tearfully for demonstrators to stay peaceful. Read the full story about protests in Europe here. Thousands protest again near White House WASHINGTON — Thousands of protesters in the nation’s capital knelt and sang “Amazing Grace” on Wednesday, the sixth night of protests over the death of George Floyd in Minnesota. “We are not going anywhere,” the protesters chanted. As the protesters sang and chanted, law enforcement officers in riot gear stood watching over the crowd, which stretched down 16th Street near the White House. The crowd knelt silently as the time neared for a virtual town hall by former President Barack Obama to discuss Floyd’s death, policing and the protests that have engulfed the country. Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser imposed an 11 p.m. curfew after a peaceful night of protests. The curfew then had been 7 p.m. Activists use informal tools to keep the peace at protests When Berto Aguayo heard that Chicago protests started turning violent over the weekend, he called a few dozen people to meet in front of a colorful mural in a South Side neighborhood. “Number one, we are here to peacefully protect small businesses,” Aguayo — co-founder of Increase the Peace, a community organizing group in the city — told the small crowd. He said the the businesses were locally owned, and residents relied on them: “That is it. If somebody is trying to loot, don’t greet them with hostility. Ask them if they want water, a, snack, engage in dialogue. If that doesn’t work, don’t put your life at risk.” There was no formal training, just a pep talk and a short prayer. Then the group took its place in front of one street’s storefronts, many of them immigrant-owned: mom-and-pop grocery stores, restaurants and a homeless youth shelter. Aguayo, a former gang member and activist for many Chicago issues, said the group was successful in helping to maintain calm that day. It’s part of several efforts around the country that aim to quell tension — and therefore potential violence — at protests, while encouraging folks to march and speak their minds about the deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery and other African Americans. With daily protests around the United States in dozens of cities — some stretching for a week and showing no sign of slowing — organizers say it’s essential to de-escalate any conflict and to avoid theft, vandalism and clashes with police. Some groups, such as Black Lives Matter, have years of experience protesting and use training and proven strategies: fluorescent vests or colored ribbons to designate legal aid, volunteer medical help or peacekeepers who can try to diffuse spats on the spot. Other people are creating more informal networks as protests pop up in new corners of their cities and states daily, with many attendees who’ve never protested before. “We want to be vocal and peaceful at the same time. Those two do coexist,” said Bruce Wilson, of South Carolina. “As soon as you throw a bottle, your message is gone.” He and about 20 others met briefly before protests in Greenville over the weekend to discuss strategies. He urged his group to carefully study fellow protestors and be mindful if someone appeared extremely agitated. “You can look at someone and tell they’re about to cross the line,” he said. Like Aguayo, he offers snacks, water, and the space to speak. “I tell them, ‘I feel the same way you feel.’ You have to lead by example.” In Tampa, Black Lives Matter organizers over the weekend had nearly 100 safety marshals in fluorescent vests patrolling their march, trained in de-escalation tactics and ordered to be on the lookout for antagonists. The group also had medics, used walkie talkies to identify and squelch outbursts, and enlisted lawyers and others with legal training to watch out for protesters’ rights from the sidelines. Murder charge upgraded, 3 other officers charged in George Floyd killing MINNEAPOLIS — Prosecutors are charging a Minneapolis police officer accused of pressing his knee against George Floyd’s neck with second-degree murder, and for the first time will level charges against three other officers at the scene, a newspaper reported Wednesday. Widely seen bystander video showing Floyd’s May 25 death has sparked sometimes violent protests nationwide and around the world. The officer, Derek Chauvin, was fired May 26 and initially charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. The three other officers involved were also fired but were not immediately charged. The Star Tribune reported citing multiple sources reported that Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison would be upgrading the charge against Chauvin while also charging Thomas Lane, J. Kueng and Tou Thao with aiding and abetting murder Floyd’s family and protesters have repeatedly called for criminal charges against all four officers as well as more serious charges for Chauvin, who held his knee to Floyd’s neck, despite his protests that he couldn’t breathe, and stayed there even after Floyd stopped moving. Floyd, a black man, was in handcuffs when he died with his face pressed to the street. Widely seen bystander video showing Floyd’s death has sparked sometimes violent protests around the world against police brutality and discrimination. “He died because he was starving for air,” said amily attorney Ben Crump. “He needed a breath. So we are demanding justice. We expect all of the police officers to be arrested before we have the memorial here in Minneapolis, Minnesota, tomorrow.” Crump said the other officers — two who helped restrain Floyd and one standing by — failed to protect a man who pleaded for help and said he couldn’t breathe. The Minneapolis Police Department has identified them as Thomas Lane, J. Kueng and Tou Thao. Read the full story here. Pentagon chief breaks with Trump on whether to use active-duty military Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper said Wednesday that he does not support the use of the Insurrection Act to quell unrest in the country, advocating instead for limits on how much active-duty forces can be used. “The option to use active-duty forces in a law enforcement role should only be used as a matter of last resort and only in the most urgent and dire of situations,” Esper said. “We are not in one of those situations now. I do not support invoking the Insurrection Act.” The comments came after President Trump has threatened to send the U.S. military to quell protests following the death of George Floyd, a black man who was killed by a white police officer on video last week in Minneapolis. The Pentagon repositioned some 1,400 active-duty troops outside Washington in recent days but has so far relied on the D.C. National Guard to assist law enforcement in the city. Pentagon officials have said that they were discussing whether some complementary role for active-duty troops was required to assist National Guard and law enforcement authorities. The invocation of the Insurrection Act would allow U.S. troops to carry out arrests and other law enforcement functions that they do not currently have. Read the rest of this story here. White House may back off plan to send troops to states WASHINGTON — After threatening states that he would dispatch the military to quell protests, President Donald Trump appeared to be privately backing off, with White House officials saying the response to demonstrations across the country indicated that local governments should be able to restore order themselves. The shift came as protests in Washington and other cities over police brutality against minorities proceeded Tuesday with relative calm, a striking contrast to the harsh crackdowns outside the White House on Monday night.

Nation’s streets calmer; police credit curfews MINNEAPOLIS — The nation’s streets were calmer than they have been in days since the killing of George Floyd set off mostly peaceful but sometimes violent demonstrations over police brutality and injustice against African Americans. Earlier curfews and efforts by protesters to contain the lawlessness were credited with preventing more widespread damage to businesses in New York and other cities overnight. By Wednesday morning, arrests had grown to more than 9,000 nationwide since the vandalism, arson and shootings erupted around the U.S. in reaction to Floyd’s death May 25 in Minneapolis. At least 12 deaths have been reported, though the circumstances in many cases are still being sorted out. In Washington, where authorities ordered people off streets before sundown, thousands of demonstrators massed a block from the White House on Tuesday evening, following a crackdown a day earlier when officers drove peaceful protesters away from Lafayette Park to clear the way for President Donald Trump to do a photo op with a Bible at a church. A black chain-link fence was put up to block access to the park. “Last night pushed me way over the edge,” said Jessica DeMaio, 40, of Washington, who attended a Floyd protest for the first time. “Being here is better than being at home feeling helpless.” Pastors at the church prayed with demonstrators and handed out water bottles. The crowd remained in place after the city’s 7 p.m. curfew passed, defying warnings that the response from law enforcement could be even more forceful. But the people were peaceful, even polite. At one point, the crowd booed when a protester climbed a light post and took down a street sign. A chant went up: “Peaceful protest!” Pope Francis called for national reconciliation and peace, saying he has ‘’witnessed with great concern the disturbing social unrest’’ in the U.S. “My friends, we cannot tolerate or turn a blind eye to racism and exclusion in any form and yet claim to defend the sacredness of every human life,’’ he said.

The police sprayed them When police moved in to clear protesters at a Columbus, Ohio, demonstration Monday night, most fled, but three Ohio State University students showed their press passes. After a repeated exchange – with officers telling them it was after the 10 p.m. curfew and time to leave, and students responding that they were members of the news media, exempt from the rule – an officer shoved one of the students, according to Sarah Szilagy, campus editor of the Lantern, a campus newspaper. Then another officer pepper-sprayed them at point-blank range, she said. The spray got in her eye and hit other reporters as they rushed away toward an alley. “We felt it hit us again,” said Max Garrison, a third-year student who is assistant campus editor at the Lantern, even as they were holding up their press passes, “while coughing and hacking up pepper spray from our lungs.” A spokesman for the Columbus Division of Police did not respond to a request for comment. The three reporters were hard to identify as members of the press, Columbus Police Chief Thomas Quinlan said at a news conference Tuesday. In a chaotic protest scene, Quinlan said, “Mistakes will happen. And we’ll take action to correct them and make sure that we do not allow our mistakes to be repeated.” The reporters, who have been covering the protests over George Floyd’s death for days, said Sunday was the only day they didn’t get sprayed. But on the other days they were close to protesters, and had not identified themselves to police as reporters. It was frightening, Szilagy said, but it also made her angry. “They basically just censored us,” Szilagy said, “and made us incapable of covering other things that happened that night.” 10 arrested in Manchester, N.H. after protests MANCHESTER, N.H. — At least 10 people were arrested in New Hampshire’s largest city after a crowd gathered on a main street and some people set off fireworks and threw bottles and other items at police vehicles, authorities said. Police in Manchester shut down off-ramps in both directions from Interstate 293 at South Willow Street as they worked to control the crowd late Tuesday into early Wednesday. Shortly before midnight, the police posted on Facebook that “multiple arrests” were made as protesters “scream at officers and call names. ” Earlier Tuesday night, police said hundreds of people came to Manchester’s Stark Park for a peaceful demonstration and candlelight vigil in memory of George Floyd, a black man who died in police custody in Minneapolis. DC officials push back on aggressive federal response to protests WASHINGTON — Officials in the nation’s capital pushed back on an aggressive response by the federal government to demonstrations over the death of George Floyd, with the mayor flatly rejecting a Trump administration proposal for the federal government to take over its police force and one Virginia county pulling its officers from Washington. The federal government has deployed law enforcement officials from numerous agencies, and National Guard troops from a number of states have been sent to the District of Columbia. Attorney General William Barr, who is directing the federal law enforcement response in the city, promised by Tuesday “even greater law enforcement resources and support in the region.” District of Columbia Mayor Muriel Bowser said the Trump administration floated the idea of taking over the Metropolitan Police Department, a proposal she strongly rejected. She threatened to take legal action if the federal government attempted to do so. Hours before a 7 p.m. curfew Tuesday, cars were being stopped at military checkpoints in downtown Washington and a cavalry of armored military vehicles could be seen driving through the district. Two Defense Department officials said the Trump administration had ordered military aircraft to fly above Washington on Monday night as a “show of force” against demonstrators protesting the death of Floyd, a black man who died after a white Minneapolis policeman pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes even after Floyd stopped moving and pleading for air. Police made over 300 arrests, mainly for violating the district’s curfew. Earlier Monday evening, law enforcement officers on foot and horseback moved aggressively to clear protesters away from Lafayette Park near the White House in advance of President Donald Trump’s walk to a nearby church for a photo opportunity. After participating in the show of force, Arlington County in Virginia pulled out its officers, saying they were used “for a purpose not worthy of our mutual aid obligations.” County Board Chair Libby Garvey said on Twitter she’s “appalled” that the mutual aid agreement was abused “for a photo op.” In a phone interview, Garvey said the aid request came from U.S. Park Police, and that the agencies have aided each other routinely over the years. She said Arlington Police had helped in Washington on Saturday and Sunday without incident. Read the full story here. Send questions/comments to the editors. « Previous Next » filed under:",0.0

The shift came as protests in Washington and other cities over police brutality against minorities proceeded Tuesday with relative calm, a striking contrast to the harsh crackdowns outside the White House on Monday night. The president wanted to make the aggressive action in the nation’s capital an example for the rest of the country, a senior White House official said Tuesday.

He said he had expected to view damage to a bathroom facility that had been vandalized in Lafayette Park, across from the White House, and talk with National Guard troops positioned there. Protests have sprung up following the death of George Floyd, a black man who died after a white Minneapolis police officer pinned him down and pressed Floyd’s neck with his knee. Violent demonstrations have raged in scores of American cities, a level of unrest unseen for decades. The situation in Washington escalated Monday, becoming a potent symbol of Trump’s policing tactics and a physical manifestation of the rhetorical culture war he has stoked since before he was elected. Nearly 30 minutes before a 7 p.m. curfew in Washington, U.S. Park Police repelled protesters with what they said were smoke canisters and pepper balls. “D.C. had no problems last night. Many arrests. Great job done by all. Overwhelming force. Domination,” Trump tweeted Tuesday, after a night in which heavily armed military forces and federal officers swarmed the city. Trump added, “(thank you President Trump!).” The clampdown followed a weekend of demonstrations outside the White House. Trump had been furious about images juxtaposing fires set in the park outside the executive mansion with a darkened White House in the background, according to current and former campaign and administration officials. He was also angry about the news coverage revealing he had been rushed to the White House bunker during Friday’s protests. In a Monday address in the Rose Garden, he called on governors to ramp up the National Guard presence to tamp down the protests. If they didn’t, Trump said, he would dispatch the military to their states — a step rarely taken in modern American history. The federal government has provided affected states with a list of National Guard resources available to them, the White House official said. The official added that Trump’s message to governors was that if they don’t use all the tools in their arsenal, they shouldn’t expect a sympathetic response to any request for federal dollars to help with cleanup and recovery down. On Monday, 715 soldiers from the 82nd Airborne Division arrived in the capital area in case the situation in Washington escalated. They are stationed at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland and Fort Belvoir in Virginia. Two more 82nd Airborne battalions, totaling 1,300 soldiers, are on standby at Fort Bragg in North Carolina, according to documents reviewed by the AP. The plan is named Operation Themis. The soldiers on standby in the Washington area are armed and have riot gear and bayonets. After the AP first reported the issuing of bayonets Tuesday, orders came down that soldiers would not need the knife-like weapons that can be affixed to rifles, according to two soldiers from the 82nd who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear they would be punished for commenting publicly. The idea that bayonets could be used in confronting civilians provoked an outcry on social media and among some members of Congress. Administration officials were privately acknowledging that Monday’s events didn’t serve the administration well. Some Republican lawmakers, typically in lockstep with the president or at least refrain from publicly criticizing him, said Trump had gone too far in appearing to use force to clear the way for his visit to the church. “There is no right to riot, no right to destroy others’ property, and no right to throw rocks at police,” said Nebraska Republican Sen. Ben Sasse. “But there is a fundamental — a constitutional — right to protest, and I’m against clearing out a peaceful protest for a photo op that treats the Word of God as a political prop.” Former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, said of Trump posing for photos holding up a Bible, “I just wish he opened it once in a while.” It was Attorney General William Barr who gave the order for law enforcement to clear out the protest before Trump’s walk to the church ahead of Washington’s 7 p.m. curfew. A person familiar with the matter said the decision was made earlier Monday, but had not been executed by the time Barr arrived in Lafayette Park to survey the scene. He verbally gave the order at that time. After the demonstrators had been pushed out of the park, Trump emerged from the White House with several officials, including Esper and Gen. Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Senior defense officials told reporters Milley was also not aware that the Park Police and law enforcement had made a decision to clear the square or that Trump intended to visit the church. They had been in Washington to coordinate with federal law enforcement officials but were diverted to the White House to brief Trump on military preparations, the officials said. The White House, Defense, campaign officials and others with knowledge of Monday’s events all insisted on anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. ___ Lemire reported from New York and LaPorta reported from Delray Beach, Florida.

In Athens, police fired tear gas to disperse youths who threw firebombs and stones at them outside the U.S. Embassy toward the end of an otherwise peaceful protest by about 4,000 people. No injuries or arrests were reported. The London demonstration began in Hyde Park, with protesters chanting “Black lives matter,” before many of them later marched through the streets, blocking traffic. Some of them converged on Parliament and the nearby Downing Street office of Prime Minister Boris Johnson. A few scuffles erupted between protesters and police outside the street’s heavy metal gates. Inside, Johnson told a news conference that he was “appalled and sickened” by Floyd’s death on May 25 when a white Minneapolis officer, Derek Chauvin, pressed his knee on the handcuffed black man’s neck for several minutes. Earlier, “Star Wars” actor John Boyega, who was born in Britain to Nigerian parents and grew up in south London’s Peckham neighborhood, pleaded tearfully for demonstrators to stay peaceful. Read the full story about protests in Europe here. Thousands protest again near White House WASHINGTON — Thousands of protesters in the nation’s capital knelt and sang “Amazing Grace” on Wednesday, the sixth night of protests over the death of George Floyd in Minnesota. “We are not going anywhere,” the protesters chanted. As the protesters sang and chanted, law enforcement officers in riot gear stood watching over the crowd, which stretched down 16th Street near the White House. The crowd knelt silently as the time neared for a virtual town hall by former President Barack Obama to discuss Floyd’s death, policing and the protests that have engulfed the country. Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser imposed an 11 p.m. curfew after a peaceful night of protests. The curfew then had been 7 p.m. Activists use informal tools to keep the peace at protests When Berto Aguayo heard that Chicago protests started turning violent over the weekend, he called a few dozen people to meet in front of a colorful mural in a South Side neighborhood. “Number one, we are here to peacefully protect small businesses,” Aguayo — co-founder of Increase the Peace, a community organizing group in the city — told the small crowd. He said the the businesses were locally owned, and residents relied on them: “That is it. If somebody is trying to loot, don’t greet them with hostility. Ask them if they want water, a, snack, engage in dialogue. If that doesn’t work, don’t put your life at risk.” There was no formal training, just a pep talk and a short prayer. Then the group took its place in front of one street’s storefronts, many of them immigrant-owned: mom-and-pop grocery stores, restaurants and a homeless youth shelter. Aguayo, a former gang member and activist for many Chicago issues, said the group was successful in helping to maintain calm that day. It’s part of several efforts around the country that aim to quell tension — and therefore potential violence — at protests, while encouraging folks to march and speak their minds about the deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery and other African Americans. With daily protests around the United States in dozens of cities — some stretching for a week and showing no sign of slowing — organizers say it’s essential to de-escalate any conflict and to avoid theft, vandalism and clashes with police. Some groups, such as Black Lives Matter, have years of experience protesting and use training and proven strategies: fluorescent vests or colored ribbons to designate legal aid, volunteer medical help or peacekeepers who can try to diffuse spats on the spot. Other people are creating more informal networks as protests pop up in new corners of their cities and states daily, with many attendees who’ve never protested before. “We want to be vocal and peaceful at the same time. Those two do coexist,” said Bruce Wilson, of South Carolina. “As soon as you throw a bottle, your message is gone.” He and about 20 others met briefly before protests in Greenville over the weekend to discuss strategies. He urged his group to carefully study fellow protestors and be mindful if someone appeared extremely agitated. “You can look at someone and tell they’re about to cross the line,” he said. Like Aguayo, he offers snacks, water, and the space to speak. “I tell them, ‘I feel the same way you feel.’ You have to lead by example.” In Tampa, Black Lives Matter organizers over the weekend had nearly 100 safety marshals in fluorescent vests patrolling their march, trained in de-escalation tactics and ordered to be on the lookout for antagonists. The group also had medics, used walkie talkies to identify and squelch outbursts, and enlisted lawyers and others with legal training to watch out for protesters’ rights from the sidelines. Murder charge upgraded, 3 other officers charged in George Floyd killing MINNEAPOLIS — Prosecutors are charging a Minneapolis police officer accused of pressing his knee against George Floyd’s neck with second-degree murder, and for the first time will level charges against three other officers at the scene, a newspaper reported Wednesday. Widely seen bystander video showing Floyd’s May 25 death has sparked sometimes violent protests nationwide and around the world. The officer, Derek Chauvin, was fired May 26 and initially charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. The three other officers involved were also fired but were not immediately charged. The Star Tribune reported citing multiple sources reported that Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison would be upgrading the charge against Chauvin while also charging Thomas Lane, J. Kueng and Tou Thao with aiding and abetting murder Floyd’s family and protesters have repeatedly called for criminal charges against all four officers as well as more serious charges for Chauvin, who held his knee to Floyd’s neck, despite his protests that he couldn’t breathe, and stayed there even after Floyd stopped moving. Floyd, a black man, was in handcuffs when he died with his face pressed to the street. Widely seen bystander video showing Floyd’s death has sparked sometimes violent protests around the world against police brutality and discrimination. “He died because he was starving for air,” said amily attorney Ben Crump. “He needed a breath. So we are demanding justice. We expect all of the police officers to be arrested before we have the memorial here in Minneapolis, Minnesota, tomorrow.” Crump said the other officers — two who helped restrain Floyd and one standing by — failed to protect a man who pleaded for help and said he couldn’t breathe. The Minneapolis Police Department has identified them as Thomas Lane, J. Kueng and Tou Thao. Read the full story here. Pentagon chief breaks with Trump on whether to use active-duty military Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper said Wednesday that he does not support the use of the Insurrection Act to quell unrest in the country, advocating instead for limits on how much active-duty forces can be used. “The option to use active-duty forces in a law enforcement role should only be used as a matter of last resort and only in the most urgent and dire of situations,” Esper said. “We are not in one of those situations now. I do not support invoking the Insurrection Act.” The comments came after President Trump has threatened to send the U.S. military to quell protests following the death of George Floyd, a black man who was killed by a white police officer on video last week in Minneapolis. The Pentagon repositioned some 1,400 active-duty troops outside Washington in recent days but has so far relied on the D.C. National Guard to assist law enforcement in the city. Pentagon officials have said that they were discussing whether some complementary role for active-duty troops was required to assist National Guard and law enforcement authorities. The invocation of the Insurrection Act would allow U.S. troops to carry out arrests and other law enforcement functions that they do not currently have. Read the rest of this story here.

1624321403,2020-06-03 03:05:07,Trumps Maine visit will likely be expensive and complicated  Politics  Bangor Daily News  BDN Maine,https://bangordailynews.com/2020/06/02/politics/trumps-maine-visit-will-likely-be-expensive-and-complicated/,en,False,politics and government,658823,State News - United States - Maine,http://www.maine.statenews.net/,"Amber Waterman | BDN Amber Waterman | BDN • June 2, 2020 7:07 pm Updated: June 3, 2020 8:28 am Maine police agencies and the Secret Service are planning for President Donald Trump’s planned Friday visit to a medical swab manufacturer that could involve a costly and complex transfer from the Bangor airport to the Piscataquis County town roughly 45 miles away. The president’s trip seems to have been quickly arranged. Gov. Janet Mills said she learned about it on Sunday. It was confirmed by the White House on Monday after an exchange between the president and Mills leaked from a testy call with governors over the response to protests across the country. The event is likely to pull large amounts of law enforcement officers from their regular duties to help protect Trump and his route. A protest scheduled outside the event could pose more security challenges. Details of the trip have not been confirmed. Trump is likely to land Air Force One at the Bangor International Airport on Friday, though an airport spokesperson said she could not confirm that. The president is likely to travel to Guilford on Marine One, his helicopter. On Tuesday, videos posted to social media showed government helicopters taking off and landing at Piscataquis Community High School. Kathie Summers-Grice, a Republican operative who helped plan roughly two dozen visits to Maine by former President George W. Bush while she was working in his administration or on associated campaigns, said she had never worked on a presidential visit to Maine with such a long transfer from airport to event, but said it would “suck up a lot of community resources.” The Secret Service may have to establish command posts in Bangor and Guilford to manage logistics, she said. There are then the costs of getting all vehicles and necessary aircraft to Maine while coordinating with local officials while securing airspace as Trump lands in Bangor and makes the transfer to Guilford. “It makes it very tricky because you’re going to have to secure that route and that takes a lot of time and resources,” Summers-Grice said. Four trips by Trump to his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida over the course of just over a month in 2017 cost federal agencies $13.6 million, according to a review last year by the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office. Most went toward operating government aircraft and boats with $3 million to supporting expenses including transportation, lodging and meals. The Secret Service and White House perform days and sometimes weeks of security and logistics work to prepare a location for the president’s arrival. Maine State Police spokesperson Stephen McCausland said the agency began planning for the trip on Monday. He would not say how many troopers will be involved in the event. Ernie Clark | BDN Ernie Clark | BDN The White House did not answer logistical questions on Tuesday and a spokesperson for Puritan Medical Products, the host of the event and one of the two largest worldwide manufacturers of medical swabs used to test for the coronavirus, did not respond to a request for comment. There were no signs of an increased security presence at the facility on Tuesday morning. Piscataquis County Sheriff Bob Young, who is coordinating the local and county law enforcement response, said he is working with Penobscot County and 14 of the state’s 16 sheriffs have agreed to send deputies to help out. Route planning and itineraries will be coordinated by the Secret Service, Young said. The federal government does not reimburse local agencies for helping the Secret Service protect the president as a rule. Congress set aside $61 million in 2017 to reimburse New York City and Palm Beach, Florida — where Trump has homes — for frequent security expenses. That could cause grief for responding agencies. Piscataquis County manager Michael Williams said commissioners “don’t like to see a lot of fluff in the budget” and try to be conservative. The announcement of the president’s visit to Guilford came amid growing unrest in Maine and nationwide after the police killing of George Floyd, a black man in Minneapolis. A rally in Portland on Monday night led to 23 arrests after weekend protests remained peaceful. Organizers are planning a Black Lives Matter rally in Guilford corresponding with the Friday visit. Young, the sheriff, wrote on Facebook that he planned to protect the right to assemble while asking protesters and anyone opposed to them to remain peaceful. Dover-Foxcroft police Chief Ryan Reardon said reports on social media of people coming from out of town or outside the state could ratchet up stress on police and the small town where only certain officers are trained to handle protests. “You wouldn’t throw someone into a situation they’re not prepared to handle,” he said.

1624333909,2020-06-03 09:06:07,DC officials push back on aggressive response to protests,https://www.pressherald.com/2020/06/03/dc-officials-push-back-on-aggressive-response-to-protests/,en,False,"politics and government, united states politics and government, armament, defense and military forces, police, roads and traffic, demonstrations and riots",366984,pressherald.com,http://pressherald.com/,"WASHINGTON — Officials in the nation’s capital pushed back on an aggressive response by the federal government to demonstrations over the death of George Floyd, with the mayor flatly rejecting a Trump administration proposal for the federal government to take over its police force and one Virginia county pulling its officers from Washington. The federal government has deployed law enforcement officials from numerous agencies, and National Guard troops from a number of states have been sent to the District of Columbia. Attorney General William Barr, who is directing the federal law enforcement response in the city, promised by Tuesday “even greater law enforcement resources and support in the region.” District of Columbia Mayor Muriel Bowser said the Trump administration floated the idea of taking over the Metropolitan Police Department, a proposal she strongly rejected. She threatened to take legal action if the federal government attempted to do so. Hours before a 7 p.m. curfew Tuesday, cars were being stopped at military checkpoints in downtown Washington and a cavalry of armored military vehicles could be seen driving through the district. Two Defense Department officials said the Trump administration had ordered military aircraft to fly above Washington on Monday night as a “show of force” against demonstrators protesting the death of Floyd, a black man who died after a white Minneapolis policeman pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes even after Floyd stopped moving and pleading for air. Police made over 300 arrests, mainly for violating the district’s curfew. Earlier Monday evening, law enforcement officers on foot and horseback moved aggressively to clear protesters away from Lafayette Park near the White House in advance of President Donald Trump’s walk to a nearby church for a photo opportunity. After participating in the show of force, Arlington County in Virginia pulled out its officers, saying they were used “for a purpose not worthy of our mutual aid obligations.” County Board Chair Libby Garvey said on Twitter she’s “appalled” that the mutual aid agreement was abused “for a photo op.” In a phone interview, Garvey said the aid request came from U.S. Park Police, and that the agencies have aided each other routinely over the years. She said Arlington Police had helped in Washington on Saturday and Sunday without incident. Arlington County officials said in a statement their officers never wielded their batons and did not fire rubber bullets or tear gas. But after watching the scene unfold on live television, the police chief ordered all the officers to return to Virginia. “This unprecedented decision by the County was a necessary response to an unprecedented situation,” the statement said. Officials said they were reevaluating the mutual aid agreements to ensure officers “are never again put in a situation where they are asked to take action that is inconsistent with our values.” The U.S. Park Police on Tuesday defended its actions at the park, saying it issued three warnings over a loudspeaker before clearing the area of protesters, some of whom they said were becoming violent, throwing projectiles and trying to grab weapons. It said it used smoke canisters and pepper balls to disperse the crowd. Barr ordered law enforcement officials to clear the park and push back the perimeter around the White House when he arrived there Monday evening, ahead of the president’s remarks, leading to police using force to disperse protesters, a person familiar with the matter told the AP. Officials had decided the perimeter had to be moved by at least one full block, after multiple fires were set in the park the night before, the person said. When Barr arrived, he was surprised it hadn’t been done and directed action to be taken, according to the person, who could not discuss the matter publicly and spoke to AP on condition of anonymity. In a Monday call with governors, Trump and Barr had encouraged more aggressive action against those who cause violence during protests across the country. Trump said he was “taking immediate presidential action to stop the violence and restore security and safety in America.” The president urged governors to deploy the National Guard, which he credited with helping calm the situation Sunday night in Minneapolis, and demanded that similarly tough measures be taken in cities that also experienced spasms of violence, including New York, Philadelphia and Los Angeles. Between the protests and the response to the coronavirus pandemic, the National Guard has been deployed at its highest level in recent history, surpassing the number of troops sent to the Gulf Coast during Hurricane Katrina in 2005. More than 66,700 soldiers and airman have been activated — 45,000 to assist with the pandemic and more than 17,000 to help with the protests. The federal government has provided affected states with a list of available National Guard resources, a White House official said. The official added that Trump’s message to governors was if they don’t use the tools in their arsenal they shouldn’t expect a sympathetic response from Washington if they request federal dollars to help with clean-up and recovery down the line. The official could not discuss the matter publicly and spoke to AP on condition of anonymity. Other law enforcement resources were also being mobilized in Washington. The Justice Department had deployed agents from every one of its agencies, including the FBI’s Hostage Rescue Team, an elite tactical unit, and riot teams from the Bureau of Prisons. The U.S. Park Police and Secret Service have had dozens of officers out in riot gear in Washington for the last few nights, in addition to the Metropolitan Police Department. U.S. Customs and Border Protection and other Homeland Security agencies were also dispatched. Most of the protesters have been peaceful and tried to discourage violence. Trump, Barr and others have tried to blame some of the civil unrest on left-wing extremist groups, including antifa, and other “anarchists.” Short for anti-fascists, antifa is an umbrella term for far-left-leaning militant groups that resist neo-Nazis and white supremacists at demonstrations. The Justice Department has vowed to treat the “violence instigated and carried out by antifa & other similar groups” as domestic terrorism. Although there isn’t a specific federal domestic terrorism statute, prosecutors could charge other offenses and seek enhanced sentencing. ___ Associated Press writers Zeke Miller, Lolita C.

In Athens, police fired tear gas to disperse youths who threw firebombs and stones at them outside the U.S. Embassy toward the end of an otherwise peaceful protest by about 4,000 people. No injuries or arrests were reported. The London demonstration began in Hyde Park, with protesters chanting “Black lives matter,” before many of them later marched through the streets, blocking traffic. Some of them converged on Parliament and the nearby Downing Street office of Prime Minister Boris Johnson. A few scuffles erupted between protesters and police outside the street’s heavy metal gates. Inside, Johnson told a news conference that he was “appalled and sickened” by Floyd’s death on May 25 when a white Minneapolis officer, Derek Chauvin, pressed his knee on the handcuffed black man’s neck for several minutes. Earlier, “Star Wars” actor John Boyega, who was born in Britain to Nigerian parents and grew up in south London’s Peckham neighborhood, pleaded tearfully for demonstrators to stay peaceful. Read the full story about protests in Europe here. Thousands protest again near White House WASHINGTON — Thousands of protesters in the nation’s capital knelt and sang “Amazing Grace” on Wednesday, the sixth night of protests over the death of George Floyd in Minnesota. “We are not going anywhere,” the protesters chanted. As the protesters sang and chanted, law enforcement officers in riot gear stood watching over the crowd, which stretched down 16th Street near the White House. The crowd knelt silently as the time neared for a virtual town hall by former President Barack Obama to discuss Floyd’s death, policing and the protests that have engulfed the country. Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser imposed an 11 p.m. curfew after a peaceful night of protests. The curfew then had been 7 p.m. Activists use informal tools to keep the peace at protests When Berto Aguayo heard that Chicago protests started turning violent over the weekend, he called a few dozen people to meet in front of a colorful mural in a South Side neighborhood. “Number one, we are here to peacefully protect small businesses,” Aguayo — co-founder of Increase the Peace, a community organizing group in the city — told the small crowd. He said the the businesses were locally owned, and residents relied on them: “That is it. If somebody is trying to loot, don’t greet them with hostility. Ask them if they want water, a, snack, engage in dialogue. If that doesn’t work, don’t put your life at risk.” There was no formal training, just a pep talk and a short prayer. Then the group took its place in front of one street’s storefronts, many of them immigrant-owned: mom-and-pop grocery stores, restaurants and a homeless youth shelter. Aguayo, a former gang member and activist for many Chicago issues, said the group was successful in helping to maintain calm that day. It’s part of several efforts around the country that aim to quell tension — and therefore potential violence — at protests, while encouraging folks to march and speak their minds about the deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery and other African Americans. With daily protests around the United States in dozens of cities — some stretching for a week and showing no sign of slowing — organizers say it’s essential to de-escalate any conflict and to avoid theft, vandalism and clashes with police. Some groups, such as Black Lives Matter, have years of experience protesting and use training and proven strategies: fluorescent vests or colored ribbons to designate legal aid, volunteer medical help or peacekeepers who can try to diffuse spats on the spot. Other people are creating more informal networks as protests pop up in new corners of their cities and states daily, with many attendees who’ve never protested before. “We want to be vocal and peaceful at the same time. Those two do coexist,” said Bruce Wilson, of South Carolina. “As soon as you throw a bottle, your message is gone.” He and about 20 others met briefly before protests in Greenville over the weekend to discuss strategies. He urged his group to carefully study fellow protestors and be mindful if someone appeared extremely agitated. “You can look at someone and tell they’re about to cross the line,” he said. Like Aguayo, he offers snacks, water, and the space to speak. “I tell them, ‘I feel the same way you feel.’ You have to lead by example.” In Tampa, Black Lives Matter organizers over the weekend had nearly 100 safety marshals in fluorescent vests patrolling their march, trained in de-escalation tactics and ordered to be on the lookout for antagonists. The group also had medics, used walkie talkies to identify and squelch outbursts, and enlisted lawyers and others with legal training to watch out for protesters’ rights from the sidelines. Murder charge upgraded, 3 other officers charged in George Floyd killing MINNEAPOLIS — Prosecutors are charging a Minneapolis police officer accused of pressing his knee against George Floyd’s neck with second-degree murder, and for the first time will level charges against three other officers at the scene, a newspaper reported Wednesday. Widely seen bystander video showing Floyd’s May 25 death has sparked sometimes violent protests nationwide and around the world. The officer, Derek Chauvin, was fired May 26 and initially charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. The three other officers involved were also fired but were not immediately charged. The Star Tribune reported citing multiple sources reported that Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison would be upgrading the charge against Chauvin while also charging Thomas Lane, J. Kueng and Tou Thao with aiding and abetting murder Floyd’s family and protesters have repeatedly called for criminal charges against all four officers as well as more serious charges for Chauvin, who held his knee to Floyd’s neck, despite his protests that he couldn’t breathe, and stayed there even after Floyd stopped moving. Floyd, a black man, was in handcuffs when he died with his face pressed to the street. Widely seen bystander video showing Floyd’s death has sparked sometimes violent protests around the world against police brutality and discrimination. “He died because he was starving for air,” said amily attorney Ben Crump. “He needed a breath. So we are demanding justice. We expect all of the police officers to be arrested before we have the memorial here in Minneapolis, Minnesota, tomorrow.” Crump said the other officers — two who helped restrain Floyd and one standing by — failed to protect a man who pleaded for help and said he couldn’t breathe. The Minneapolis Police Department has identified them as Thomas Lane, J. Kueng and Tou Thao. Read the full story here. Pentagon chief breaks with Trump on whether to use active-duty military Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper said Wednesday that he does not support the use of the Insurrection Act to quell unrest in the country, advocating instead for limits on how much active-duty forces can be used. “The option to use active-duty forces in a law enforcement role should only be used as a matter of last resort and only in the most urgent and dire of situations,” Esper said. “We are not in one of those situations now. I do not support invoking the Insurrection Act.” The comments came after President Trump has threatened to send the U.S. military to quell protests following the death of George Floyd, a black man who was killed by a white police officer on video last week in Minneapolis. The Pentagon repositioned some 1,400 active-duty troops outside Washington in recent days but has so far relied on the D.C. National Guard to assist law enforcement in the city. Pentagon officials have said that they were discussing whether some complementary role for active-duty troops was required to assist National Guard and law enforcement authorities. The invocation of the Insurrection Act would allow U.S. troops to carry out arrests and other law enforcement functions that they do not currently have. Read the rest of this story here. White House may back off plan to send troops to states WASHINGTON — After threatening states that he would dispatch the military to quell protests, President Donald Trump appeared to be privately backing off, with White House officials saying the response to demonstrations across the country indicated that local governments should be able to restore order themselves. The shift came as protests in Washington and other cities over police brutality against minorities proceeded Tuesday with relative calm, a striking contrast to the harsh crackdowns outside the White House on Monday night. The president wanted to make the aggressive action in the nation’s capital an example for the rest of the country, a senior White House official said Tuesday. The Defense Department has drafted contingency plans for deploying active-duty military if needed. Pentagon documents reviewed by The Associated Press showed plans for soldiers from an Army division to protect the White House and other federal buildings if the security situation in the nation’s capital were to deteriorate and the National Guard could not secure the facilities. But interest in exerting that extraordinary federal authority appeared to be waning in the White House. Though the crackdown on the Washington demonstrations was praised by some Trump supporters Tuesday, a handful of Republicans expressed concern that law enforcement officers risked violating the protesters’ First Amendment rights. Trump’s defense secretary also distanced himself from Trump’s decision to walk across Lafayette Park for a photo opportunity at a church after the demonstrators had been cleared. Pentagon Chief Mark Esper, who walked with Trump to St. John’s Church on Monday evening, insisted he did not know the president’s destination. “I didn’t know where I was going,” Esper told NBC News. He said he had expected to view damage to a bathroom facility that had been vandalized in Lafayette Park, across from the White House, and talk with National Guard troops positioned there.

Nation’s streets calmer; police credit curfews MINNEAPOLIS — The nation’s streets were calmer than they have been in days since the killing of George Floyd set off mostly peaceful but sometimes violent demonstrations over police brutality and injustice against African Americans. Earlier curfews and efforts by protesters to contain the lawlessness were credited with preventing more widespread damage to businesses in New York and other cities overnight. By Wednesday morning, arrests had grown to more than 9,000 nationwide since the vandalism, arson and shootings erupted around the U.S. in reaction to Floyd’s death May 25 in Minneapolis. At least 12 deaths have been reported, though the circumstances in many cases are still being sorted out. In Washington, where authorities ordered people off streets before sundown, thousands of demonstrators massed a block from the White House on Tuesday evening, following a crackdown a day earlier when officers drove peaceful protesters away from Lafayette Park to clear the way for President Donald Trump to do a photo op with a Bible at a church. A black chain-link fence was put up to block access to the park. “Last night pushed me way over the edge,” said Jessica DeMaio, 40, of Washington, who attended a Floyd protest for the first time. “Being here is better than being at home feeling helpless.” Pastors at the church prayed with demonstrators and handed out water bottles. The crowd remained in place after the city’s 7 p.m. curfew passed, defying warnings that the response from law enforcement could be even more forceful. But the people were peaceful, even polite. At one point, the crowd booed when a protester climbed a light post and took down a street sign. A chant went up: “Peaceful protest!” Pope Francis called for national reconciliation and peace, saying he has ‘’witnessed with great concern the disturbing social unrest’’ in the U.S. “My friends, we cannot tolerate or turn a blind eye to racism and exclusion in any form and yet claim to defend the sacredness of every human life,’’ he said.

The police sprayed them When police moved in to clear protesters at a Columbus, Ohio, demonstration Monday night, most fled, but three Ohio State University students showed their press passes. After a repeated exchange – with officers telling them it was after the 10 p.m. curfew and time to leave, and students responding that they were members of the news media, exempt from the rule – an officer shoved one of the students, according to Sarah Szilagy, campus editor of the Lantern, a campus newspaper. Then another officer pepper-sprayed them at point-blank range, she said. The spray got in her eye and hit other reporters as they rushed away toward an alley. “We felt it hit us again,” said Max Garrison, a third-year student who is assistant campus editor at the Lantern, even as they were holding up their press passes, “while coughing and hacking up pepper spray from our lungs.” A spokesman for the Columbus Division of Police did not respond to a request for comment. The three reporters were hard to identify as members of the press, Columbus Police Chief Thomas Quinlan said at a news conference Tuesday. In a chaotic protest scene, Quinlan said, “Mistakes will happen. And we’ll take action to correct them and make sure that we do not allow our mistakes to be repeated.” The reporters, who have been covering the protests over George Floyd’s death for days, said Sunday was the only day they didn’t get sprayed. But on the other days they were close to protesters, and had not identified themselves to police as reporters. It was frightening, Szilagy said, but it also made her angry. “They basically just censored us,” Szilagy said, “and made us incapable of covering other things that happened that night.” 10 arrested in Manchester, N.H. after protests MANCHESTER, N.H. — At least 10 people were arrested in New Hampshire’s largest city after a crowd gathered on a main street and some people set off fireworks and threw bottles and other items at police vehicles, authorities said. Police in Manchester shut down off-ramps in both directions from Interstate 293 at South Willow Street as they worked to control the crowd late Tuesday into early Wednesday. Shortly before midnight, the police posted on Facebook that “multiple arrests” were made as protesters “scream at officers and call names. ” Earlier Tuesday night, police said hundreds of people came to Manchester’s Stark Park for a peaceful demonstration and candlelight vigil in memory of George Floyd, a black man who died in police custody in Minneapolis. DC officials push back on aggressive federal response to protests WASHINGTON — Officials in the nation’s capital pushed back on an aggressive response by the federal government to demonstrations over the death of George Floyd, with the mayor flatly rejecting a Trump administration proposal for the federal government to take over its police force and one Virginia county pulling its officers from Washington.

It was the fourth consecutive night and the fifth day in the past six that protesters flooded the streets of Maine’s largest city to march and chant “black lives matter,” “hands up, don’t shoot,” “I can’t breathe;” to kneel together on the pavement; and to prostrate themselves with their hands clasped behind their backs. The powerful gestures and words resounded around the city and nation as millions of protesters took to the streets after former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, who has been charged with second-degree murder, kneeled on the neck of George Floyd for nearly nine minutes while Floyd, a black man, could be heard telling police that he couldn’t breathe. More than 9,000 people have been arrested in connection with the unrest, and at least 12 deaths have been reported, though the circumstances in many cases are still being sorted out, The Associated Press reported. Hamdia Ahmed, who helped organize Wednesday’s peaceful demonstration, was joined by several city officials including Mayor Kate Snyder, City Councilor Jill Duson, School Superintendent Xavier Botana and Westbrook Police Chief Janine Roberts. They took a knee together and urged the crowd of protesters, who were mostly dressed in black clothing and wore masks, to fight against institutional racism. Ahmed, a refugee and activist, told the crowd that when she came to the United States as a child people told her it was the greatest nation in the world. Instead, she said, people of color fear the police and know the constant presence of institutional racism. “Living in that kind of fear is not living at all. I want black people to be treated like human beings,” she said. Ahmed said no person of color should be terrified if they are pulled over, while driving, by a police officer, but she said she has had to coach others on what they should say and how they should act if stopped by police. “I want every black child … to be safe, to live without trauma and to live like human beings with dignity and respect,” she said to cheers. Wednesday’s rally at City Hall was promoted as a peaceful protest following massive demonstrations Monday and Tuesday that moved through the city’s downtown and ended in clashes with police and a total of 33 arrests. Ahmed and other organizers were joined on the steps of City Hall by Portland Mayor Kate Snyder and members of the City Council. Botana told the crowd that our country is reluctant to address the issue that we are a racist nation at our core. “I am profoundly ashamed that twice as many black children in our schools are disciplined as white children,” Botana said. The protest formally ended shortly after 6 p.m., although crowds lingered in the downtown area and it was not immediately clear if other demonstrations would form. Wednesday’s protest was much different from demonstrations on Monday and Tuesday, and Ahmed condemned the recent violence by people the police have labeled agitators. “This is just a small group of people. They do not represent the movement,” Ahmed told the protesters. Ahmed and another activist, Ali Ali, issued a statement on Ahmed’s Facebook page Wednesday that explained their intentions. “We are responding to the systemic oppression of black people in this country. It’s not about police officers or police departments. This is a systemic issue that needs to be addressed,” their statement said. “We want the people in positions of power to create laws in support of those who they are governing. We want you, as in America, to fix the issues you’ve caused in the past and recent years. Systemic oppression is real and the protests are just responding to the oppression.” The protests on Monday and Tuesday in Portland did not go as smoothly. A crowd of more than 1,000 protesting police violence against people of color marched through Portland Tuesday evening. Activist Devin Moore of Bath helped organized Tuesday’s protest and was among the leaders who urged protesters to go home. Moore told News Center Maine that Tuesday’s protest was supposed to end peacefully. “It just kills me when the violence drowns out the message,” Moore told News Center Maine. “It’s not a fight against the police, it’s a fight against racism.” “We’re here to be unified, we’re here to bring peace to all of us, it’s our home,” Moore said. After Tuesday’s protest was called to an end in Congress Square by organizers around 9 p.m., a smaller group of people returned to the police station and “almost immediately began engaging in unlawful behavior,” police said Wednesday morning. Police arrested 10 people late Tuesday after fights broke out between peaceful protesters and agitators, the department said Wednesday. “Just after 10:15 p.m. someone in the group began setting off fireworks, which created an initial panic and some of the protesters began scattering. At this time a dispersal order was given to the group as officers and police headquarters were pelted with rocks, bottles, bricks and fireworks,” Lt. Robert Martin said in a news release. At 10:42 p.m., officers fired pepper balls – projectiles that contain pepper spray and burst on impact – at people who were throwing objects at police. Five minutes later, police began to make arrests. Martin said police issued multiple dispersal orders and attempted to meet with and seek compliance through the remaining group leaders. Police arrested 10 people for failure to disperse, a misdemeanor. They were all taken to Cumberland County Jail and released on bail. “The organizers of this protest engaged with us in organizing and implementing a meaningful and lawful protest in support of sending their message to the community,” Chief Frank Clark said in a statement Wednesday. “We appreciated those efforts and are disappointed with how the criminal behavior of the few has the capacity to drown out that message. We remain committed to maintaining open lines of communication and meaningful dialogue, which is more likely to result in mutual understanding and respect.” A similar protest drew 1,000 demonstrators Monday night, and 23 were arrested when protesters clashed with police. Police said Monday’s demonstration also resulted in damage to some Old Port businesses, including several that had windows broken. Many properties were defaced with graffiti and four businesses were burglarized, including Old Port Wine and Urban Outfitters, police said. Staff Writer Matt Byrne contributed to this story.

Protests have sprung up following the death of George Floyd, a black man who died after a white Minneapolis police officer pinned him down and pressed Floyd’s neck with his knee. Violent demonstrations have raged in scores of American cities, a level of unrest unseen for decades. The situation in Washington escalated Monday, becoming a potent symbol of Trump’s policing tactics and a physical manifestation of the rhetorical culture war he has stoked since before he was elected. Nearly 30 minutes before a 7 p.m. curfew in Washington, U.S. Park Police repelled protesters with what they said were smoke canisters and pepper balls. “D.C. had no problems last night. Many arrests. Great job done by all. Overwhelming force. Domination,” Trump tweeted Tuesday, after a night in which heavily armed military forces and federal officers swarmed the city. Trump added, “(thank you President Trump!).” The clampdown followed a weekend of demonstrations outside the White House. Trump had been furious about images juxtaposing fires set in the park outside the executive mansion with a darkened White House in the background, according to current and former campaign and administration officials. He was also angry about the news coverage revealing he had been rushed to the White House bunker during Friday’s protests. In a Monday address in the Rose Garden, he called on governors to ramp up the National Guard presence to tamp down the protests. If they didn’t, Trump said, he would dispatch the military to their states — a step rarely taken in modern American history. The federal government has provided affected states with a list of National Guard resources available to them, the White House official said. The official added that Trump’s message to governors was that if they don’t use all the tools in their arsenal, they shouldn’t expect a sympathetic response to any request for federal dollars to help with cleanup and recovery. On Monday, 715 soldiers from the 82nd Airborne Division arrived in the capital area in case the situation in Washington escalated. They are stationed at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland and Fort Belvoir in Virginia. Two more 82nd Airborne battalions, totaling 1,300 soldiers, are on standby at Fort Bragg in North Carolina, according to documents reviewed by the AP. The plan is named Operation Themis. The soldiers on standby in the Washington area are armed and have riot gear and bayonets. After the AP first reported the issuing of bayonets Tuesday, orders came down that soldiers would not need the knife-like weapons that can be affixed to rifles, according to two soldiers from the 82nd who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear they would be punished for commenting publicly. The idea that bayonets could be used in confronting civilians provoked an outcry on social media and among some members of Congress. Administration officials were privately acknowledging that Monday’s events didn’t serve the administration well. Some Republican lawmakers, typically in lockstep with the president or at least refrain from publicly criticizing him, said Trump had gone too far in appearing to use force to clear the way for his visit to the church. “There is no right to riot, no right to destroy others’ property, and no right to throw rocks at police,” Nebraska Republican Sen. Ben Sasse said. “But there is a fundamental — a constitutional — right to protest, and I’m against clearing out a peaceful protest for a photo op that treats the Word of God as a political prop.” Former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, said of Trump posing for photos holding up a Bible, “I just wish he opened it once in a while.” It was Attorney General William Barr who gave the order for law enforcement to clear out the protest before Trump’s walk to the church ahead of Washington’s 7 p.m. curfew. A person familiar with the matter said the decision was made earlier Monday, but had not been executed by the time Barr arrived in Lafayette Park to survey the scene. He verbally gave the order at that time. After the demonstrators had been pushed out of the park, Trump emerged from the White House with several officials, including Esper and Gen. Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Senior defense officials told reporters Milley was also not aware that the Park Police and law enforcement had made a decision to clear the square or that Trump intended to visit the church. They had been in Washington to coordinate with federal law enforcement officials but were diverted to the White House to brief Trump on military preparations, the officials said. The White House, Defense, campaign officials and others with knowledge of Monday’s events all insisted on anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.

It was the fourth consecutive night and the fifth day in the past six that protesters flooded the streets of Maine’s largest city to march and chant “black lives matter,” “hands up, don’t shoot,” “I can’t breathe;” to kneel together on the pavement; and to prostrate themselves with their hands clasped behind their backs. The powerful gestures and words resounded around the city and nation as millions of protesters took to the streets after former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, who has been charged with second-degree murder, kneeled on the neck of George Floyd for nearly nine minutes while Floyd, a black man, could be heard telling police that he couldn’t breathe. More than 9,000 people have been arrested in connection with the unrest, and at least 12 deaths have been reported, though the circumstances in many cases are still being sorted out, The Associated Press reported. Hamdia Ahmed, who helped organize Wednesday’s peaceful demonstration, was joined by several city officials including Mayor Kate Snyder, City Councilor Jill Duson, School Superintendent Xavier Botana and Westbrook Police Chief Janine Roberts. They took a knee together and urged the crowd of protesters, who were mostly dressed in black clothing and wore masks, to fight against institutional racism. Ahmed, a refugee and activist, told the crowd that when she came to the United States as a child people told her it was the greatest nation in the world. Instead, she said, people of color fear the police and know the constant presence of institutional racism. “Living in that kind of fear is not living at all. I want black people to be treated like human beings,” she said. Ahmed said no person of color should be terrified if they are pulled over, while driving, by a police officer, but she said she has had to coach others on what they should say and how they should act if stopped by police. “I want every black child … to be safe, to live without trauma and to live like human beings with dignity and respect,” she said to cheers. Wednesday’s rally at City Hall was promoted as a peaceful protest following massive demonstrations Monday and Tuesday that moved through the city’s downtown and ended in clashes with police and a total of 33 arrests. Ahmed and other organizers were joined on the steps of City Hall by Portland Mayor Kate Snyder and members of the City Council. Botana told the crowd that our country is reluctant to address the issue that we are a racist nation at our core. “I am profoundly ashamed that twice as many black children in our schools are disciplined as white children,” Botana said. The protest formally ended shortly after 6 p.m., although crowds lingered in the downtown area and it was not immediately clear if other demonstrations would form. Wednesday’s protest was much different from demonstrations on Monday and Tuesday, and Ahmed condemned the recent violence by people the police have labeled agitators. “This is just a small group of people. They do not represent the movement,” Ahmed told the protesters. Ahmed and another activist, Ali Ali, issued a statement on Ahmed’s Facebook page Wednesday that explained their intentions. “We are responding to the systemic oppression of black people in this country. It’s not about police officers or police departments. This is a systemic issue that needs to be addressed,” their statement said. “We want the people in positions of power to create laws in support of those who they are governing. We want you, as in America, to fix the issues you’ve caused in the past and recent years. Systemic oppression is real and the protests are just responding to the oppression.” The protests on Monday and Tuesday in Portland did not go as smoothly. A crowd of more than 1,000 protesting police violence against people of color marched through Portland Tuesday evening. Activist Devin Moore of Bath helped organized Tuesday’s protest and was among the leaders who urged protesters to go home. Moore told News Center Maine that Tuesday’s protest was supposed to end peacefully. “It just kills me when the violence drowns out the message,” Moore told News Center Maine. “It’s not a fight against the police, it’s a fight against racism.” “We’re here to be unified, we’re here to bring peace to all of us, it’s our home,” Moore said. After Tuesday’s protest was called to an end in Congress Square by organizers around 9 p.m., a smaller group of people returned to the police station and “almost immediately began engaging in unlawful behavior,” police said Wednesday morning. Police arrested 10 people late Tuesday after fights broke out between peaceful protesters and agitators, the department said Wednesday. “Just after 10:15 p.m. someone in the group began setting off fireworks, which created an initial panic and some of the protesters began scattering. At this time a dispersal order was given to the group as officers and police headquarters were pelted with rocks, bottles, bricks and fireworks,” Lt. Robert Martin said in a news release. At 10:42 p.m., officers fired pepper balls – projectiles that contain pepper spray and burst on impact – at people who were throwing objects at police. Five minutes later, police began to make arrests. Martin said police issued multiple dispersal orders and attempted to meet with and seek compliance through the remaining group leaders. Police arrested 10 people for failure to disperse, a misdemeanor. They were all taken to Cumberland County Jail and released on bail. “The organizers of this protest engaged with us in organizing and implementing a meaningful and lawful protest in support of sending their message to the community,” Chief Frank Clark said in a statement Wednesday. “We appreciated those efforts and are disappointed with how the criminal behavior of the few has the capacity to drown out that message. We remain committed to maintaining open lines of communication and meaningful dialogue, which is more likely to result in mutual understanding and respect.” A similar protest drew 1,000 demonstrators Monday night, and 23 were arrested when protesters clashed with police. Police said Monday’s demonstration also resulted in damage to some Old Port businesses, including several that had windows broken. Many properties were defaced with graffiti and four businesses were burglarized, including Old Port Wine and Urban Outfitters, police said. Staff Writer Matt Byrne contributed to this story.

Boston players including Jaylen Brown, Marcus Smart, Enes Kanter and Vincent Poirier have been among several NBA players to participate in recent protests following the death of George Floyd, a black man who died in Minneapolis last month after a white police officer pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck as he begged for air. Demonstrations have taken place in cities around the country in response to the incident, which was captured in a widely seen video that has mobilized protesters. A medical examiner ruled Monday that Floyd’s heart stopped as police restrained him and compressed his neck. It all prompted Stevens to write a letter to his players over the weekend in which he expressed his support for them. “I think the thing that I wanted them to know is that every decent person is hurting,” Stevens said in a conference call with reporters Tuesday. “Every decent person feels the pain of the African American community. But I also don’t want to pretend like I know the exact, distinct pain. So what I wanted them to know is that I’m with them.” The Celtics were among several professional sports teams to issue statements in the aftermath of Floyd’s death, saying in part that it and other similar incidents “have left the entire Celtics organization struggling with grief and anger.” The resulting national dialogue has reminded Stevens of the discussions he had with players prior to the 2016-17 season during the height of Colin Kaepernick’s protests when he took a knee during the national anthem prior to NFL games to protest police brutality. Stevens said those protests prompted players to share their own experiences with racial profiling and discrimination. Brown, who grew up outside of Atlanta, drove 15 hours from Boston to lead a march in Atlanta on Sunday. It’s the kind of action Steven has come to expect from the 23-year-old. “I’m not surprised with him taking a leadership role,” Stevens said. “That’s who he is.” Floyd’s death and the resulting demonstrations come at a time during which NBA leadership is trying to formulate a plan to possibly resume the season amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Stevens said the proposals are promising, but that most talk about basketball has taken a backseat in recent days. Several Celtics players did begin to take part in voluntary, individual workouts at the team’s practice facility Monday. The team is also having regular meetings via video conferencing. But Stevens said they have mostly been focusing on the mental well-being of athletes since the start of the pandemic and that’s continued during the demonstrations.",0.0

Earlier curfews and efforts by protesters to contain the lawlessness were credited with preventing more widespread damage to businesses in New York and other cities overnight. By Wednesday morning, arrests had grown to more than 9,000 nationwide since the vandalism, arson and shootings erupted around the U.S. in reaction to Floyd’s death May 25 in Minneapolis. At least 12 deaths have been reported, though the circumstances in many cases are still being sorted out. In Washington, where authorities ordered people off streets before sundown, thousands of demonstrators massed a block from the White House on Tuesday evening, following a crackdown a day earlier when officers drove peaceful protesters away from Lafayette Park to clear the way for President Donald Trump to do a photo op with a Bible at a church. A black chain-link fence was put up to block access to the park. “Last night pushed me way over the edge,” said Jessica DeMaio, 40, of Washington, who attended a Floyd protest for the first time. “Being here is better than being at home feeling helpless.” Pastors at the church prayed with demonstrators and handed out water bottles. The crowd remained in place after the city’s 7 p.m. curfew passed, defying warnings that the response from law enforcement could be even more forceful. But the people were peaceful, even polite. At one point, the crowd booed when a protester climbed a light post and took down a street sign. A chant went up: “Peaceful protest!” Pope Francis called for national reconciliation and peace, saying he has ‘’witnessed with great concern the disturbing social unrest’’ in the U.S. “My friends, we cannot tolerate or turn a blind eye to racism and exclusion in any form and yet claim to defend the sacredness of every human life,’’ he said. Trump has pushed the nation’s governors to take a hard line against the violence, tweeting on Tuesday that “lowlifes and losers” were taking over New York’s streets. He again tweeted Wednesday: “LAW & ORDER!” Thousands of people remained out in New York City on Tuesday night, undeterred by an 8 p.m. curfew, though most streets were clear by early Wednesday. Battered storefronts from the earlier rounds of violence could be seen in midtown Manhattan. The New York Police Department credited the curfew, which was three hours earlier than the day before, with helping officers take control of the streets. “The earlier curfew really helped our cops take out of the neighborhoods people that didn’t belong there,” Chief of Department Terence Monahan said on NBC’s “Today.” Protesters also marched in Los Angeles; Miami; St. Paul, Minnesota; Columbia, South Carolina; and Houston, where the police chief talked to peaceful demonstrators, vowing reforms. “God as my witness, change is coming,” Art Acevedo said. “And we’re going to do it the right way.” More than 20,000 National Guard members have been called up in 29 states to deal with the violence. In Philadelphia, a statue of former Mayor Frank Rizzo was removed by the city early Wednesday after repeatedly being targeted by vandals. Rizzo presided over a police force widely accused of racism and brutality in the 1970s. Floyd died after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee against the handcuffed black man’s neck as he cried that he couldn’t breathe. The officer, Derek Chauvin, has been fired and charged with murder. The mother of Floyd’s 6-year-old daughter, Gianna, said she wants the world to know that her little girl lost a good father. “I want everybody to know that this is what those officers took,” Roxie Washington said during a Minneapolis news conference, her daughter at her side. “I want justice for him because he was good. No matter what anybody thinks, he was good.” Minnesota is investigating whether the Minneapolis Police Department has a pattern of discrimination against minorities. Some protesters framed the burgeoning movement as a necessity after a long list of killings by police. “It feels like it’s just been an endless cascade of hashtags of black people dying, and it feels like nothing’s really being done by our political leaders to actually enact real change,” said Christine Ohenzuwa, 19, who attended a peaceful protest at the Minnesota Capitol in St. Paul. “There’s always going to be a breaking point.

Najma Abdullahi, 20 of Portland; Seth Cooper, 24, of Portland; Nicole Gagnon, 36, of Westbrook; Sinit Graziano, 31, of Portland; Katherine Johnston, 31, of Whitneyville; David Morse, 30, of New York, New York; James Marschetti, 36, of Gray; Salim Mousier, 23, of Scarborough; Tasha Tracy, 20, of Standish; and Michelle Ward, 29, of Portland were charged with failure to disperse, according to Portland police Lt. Robert Martin said Wednesday. About 1,000 protesters gathered Tuesday evening outside the Portland police station, where Portland City Manager Jon Jennings, Police Chief Frank Clark and other officers joined them to take a knee for nine minutes to mark how long a Minneapolis police officer pinned Floyd, a black man, by the neck with a knee. The officer, Derek Chauvin, was charged with murder and Floyd’s family ordered an autopsy finding he died of asphyxia. Organizers then took turns addressing the assembled crowd before marching to the Eastern Promenade and then to Congress Square Park. The organizers called the protest to an end about 9 p.m. The peacefulness of Tuesday’s rally was in marked contrast with one on Monday in which police arrested 23 people as burglaries and criminal mischief occurred at several businesses in downtown as what was a calm gathering gradually escalated into protesters throwing water bottles and police firing pepper spray. But that took a turn about 9 p.m. when Martin said a group of about 100 to 200 people returned to the Portland police station, where roughly 250 officers had blocked off the nearby intersection where Monday’s arrests took place. Fights allegedly broke out among the crowd and fireworks were set off, causing some people to scatter, according to Martin, who said that some people pelted officers with rocks, bottles and fireworks. The crowd was ordered to disperse, and when they didn’t, officers used pepper spray balls on those accused of throwing objects at them before arresting several people just before 11 p.m., according to Martin. “The organizers of this protest engaged with us in organizing and implementing a meaningful and lawful protest in support of sending their message to the community. We appreciated those efforts and are disappointed with how the criminal behavior of the few has the capacity to drown out that message. We remain committed to maintaining open lines of communication and meaningful dialogue, which is more likely to result in mutual understanding and respect,” said Clark, the police chief. The 10 who were arrested were taken to the Cumberland County Jail, where they were later released. Watch: Police push back on protesters on Franklin Street in Portland",0.0

Battered storefronts from the earlier rounds of violence could be seen in midtown Manhattan. The New York Police Department credited the curfew, which was three hours earlier than the day before, with helping officers take control of the streets. “The earlier curfew really helped our cops take out of the neighborhoods people that didn’t belong there,” Chief of Department Terence Monahan said on NBC’s “Today.” Protesters also marched in Los Angeles; Miami; St. Paul, Minnesota; Columbia, South Carolina; and Houston, where the police chief talked to peaceful demonstrators, vowing reforms. “God as my witness, change is coming,” Art Acevedo said. “And we’re going to do it the right way.” More than 20,000 National Guard members have been called up in 29 states to deal with the violence.

It was the fourth consecutive night and the fifth day in the past six that protesters flooded the streets of Maine’s largest city to march and chant “black lives matter,” “hands up, don’t shoot,” “I can’t breathe;” to kneel together on the pavement; and to prostrate themselves with their hands clasped behind their backs. The powerful gestures and words resounded around the city and nation as millions of protesters took to the streets after former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, who has been charged with second-degree murder, kneeled on the neck of George Floyd for nearly nine minutes while Floyd, a black man, could be heard telling police that he couldn’t breathe. More than 9,000 people have been arrested in connection with the unrest, and at least 12 deaths have been reported, though the circumstances in many cases are still being sorted out, The Associated Press reported. Hamdia Ahmed, who helped organize Wednesday’s peaceful demonstration, was joined by several city officials including Mayor Kate Snyder, City Councilor Jill Duson, School Superintendent Xavier Botana and Westbrook Police Chief Janine Roberts. They took a knee together and urged the crowd of protesters, who were mostly dressed in black clothing and wore masks, to fight against institutional racism. Ahmed, a refugee and activist, told the crowd that when she came to the United States as a child people told her it was the greatest nation in the world. Instead, she said, people of color fear the police and know the constant presence of institutional racism. “Living in that kind of fear is not living at all. I want black people to be treated like human beings,” she said. Ahmed said no person of color should be terrified if they are pulled over, while driving, by a police officer, but she said she has had to coach others on what they should say and how they should act if stopped by police. “I want every black child … to be safe, to live without trauma and to live like human beings with dignity and respect,” she said to cheers. Wednesday’s rally at City Hall was promoted as a peaceful protest following massive demonstrations Monday and Tuesday that moved through the city’s downtown and ended in clashes with police and a total of 33 arrests. Ahmed and other organizers were joined on the steps of City Hall by Portland Mayor Kate Snyder and members of the City Council. Botana told the crowd that our country is reluctant to address the issue that we are a racist nation at our core. “I am profoundly ashamed that twice as many black children in our schools are disciplined as white children,” Botana said. The protest formally ended shortly after 6 p.m., although crowds lingered in the downtown area and it was not immediately clear if other demonstrations would form. Wednesday’s protest was much different from demonstrations on Monday and Tuesday, and Ahmed condemned the recent violence by people the police have labeled agitators. “This is just a small group of people. They do not represent the movement,” Ahmed told the protesters. Ahmed and another activist, Ali Ali, issued a statement on Ahmed’s Facebook page Wednesday that explained their intentions. “We are responding to the systemic oppression of black people in this country. It’s not about police officers or police departments. This is a systemic issue that needs to be addressed,” their statement said. “We want the people in positions of power to create laws in support of those who they are governing. We want you, as in America, to fix the issues you’ve caused in the past and recent years. Systemic oppression is real and the protests are just responding to the oppression.” The protests on Monday and Tuesday in Portland did not go as smoothly. A crowd of more than 1,000 protesting police violence against people of color marched through Portland Tuesday evening. Activist Devin Moore of Bath helped organized Tuesday’s protest and was among the leaders who urged protesters to go home. Moore told News Center Maine that Tuesday’s protest was supposed to end peacefully. “It just kills me when the violence drowns out the message,” Moore told News Center Maine. “It’s not a fight against the police, it’s a fight against racism.” “We’re here to be unified, we’re here to bring peace to all of us, it’s our home,” Moore said. After Tuesday’s protest was called to an end in Congress Square by organizers around 9 p.m., a smaller group of people returned to the police station and “almost immediately began engaging in unlawful behavior,” police said Wednesday morning. Police arrested 10 people late Tuesday after fights broke out between peaceful protesters and agitators, the department said Wednesday. “Just after 10:15 p.m. someone in the group began setting off fireworks, which created an initial panic and some of the protesters began scattering. At this time a dispersal order was given to the group as officers and police headquarters were pelted with rocks, bottles, bricks and fireworks,” Lt. Robert Martin said in a news release. At 10:42 p.m., officers fired pepper balls – projectiles that contain pepper spray and burst on impact – at people who were throwing objects at police. Five minutes later, police began to make arrests. Martin said police issued multiple dispersal orders and attempted to meet with and seek compliance through the remaining group leaders. Police arrested 10 people for failure to disperse, a misdemeanor. They were all taken to Cumberland County Jail and released on bail. “The organizers of this protest engaged with us in organizing and implementing a meaningful and lawful protest in support of sending their message to the community,” Chief Frank Clark said in a statement Wednesday. “We appreciated those efforts and are disappointed with how the criminal behavior of the few has the capacity to drown out that message. We remain committed to maintaining open lines of communication and meaningful dialogue, which is more likely to result in mutual understanding and respect.” A similar protest drew 1,000 demonstrators Monday night, and 23 were arrested when protesters clashed with police. Police said Monday’s demonstration also resulted in damage to some Old Port businesses, including several that had windows broken. Many properties were defaced with graffiti and four businesses were burglarized, including Old Port Wine and Urban Outfitters, police said. Staff Writer Matt Byrne contributed to this story.

Earlier curfews and efforts by protesters to contain the lawlessness were credited with preventing more widespread damage to businesses in New York and other cities overnight. By Wednesday morning, arrests had grown to more than 9,000 nationwide since the vandalism, arson and shootings erupted around the U.S. in reaction to Floyd’s death May 25 in Minneapolis. At least 12 deaths have been reported, though the circumstances in many cases are still being sorted out. In Washington, where authorities ordered people off streets before sundown, thousands of demonstrators massed a block from the White House on Tuesday evening, following a crackdown a day earlier when officers drove peaceful protesters away from Lafayette Park to clear the way for President Donald Trump to do a photo op with a Bible at a church. A black chain-link fence was put up to block access to the park. “Last night pushed me way over the edge,” said Jessica DeMaio, 40, of Washington, who attended a Floyd protest for the first time. “Being here is better than being at home feeling helpless.” Pastors at the church prayed with demonstrators and handed out water bottles. The crowd remained in place after the city’s 7 p.m. curfew passed, defying warnings that the response from law enforcement could be even more forceful. But the people were peaceful, even polite. At one point, the crowd booed when a protester climbed a light post and took down a street sign. A chant went up: “Peaceful protest!” Pope Francis called for national reconciliation and peace, saying he has ‘’witnessed with great concern the disturbing social unrest’’ in the U.S. “My friends, we cannot tolerate or turn a blind eye to racism and exclusion in any form and yet claim to defend the sacredness of every human life,’’ he said.
