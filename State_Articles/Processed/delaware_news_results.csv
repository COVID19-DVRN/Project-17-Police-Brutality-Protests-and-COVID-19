1617366041,2020-05-26 16:19:56,Jones to face off  against  Meyer in  race for County Executive,https://delawarebusinessnow.com/2020/05/jones-to-face-off-against-meyer-in-race-for-county-executive/,en,False,,625606,delawarebusinessnow.com,http://delawarebusinessnow.com/,"Margaret “Maggie” Jones, Middletown, plans to face off against New Castle County Executive Matt Meyer in the Democratic primary in mid-September. Jones filed for the post this month, according to a listing from the state Department of Elections and has set up a website and social media page. Jones is an instructional coordinator at Delaware Technical Community College. According to her biography, she has spent two decades in state government. According to her website, Jones plans to seek “input and guidance from the community is critical for development projects that occur throughout New Castle County. I will ensure open communication between our communities and county government by hosting town hall meetings throughout the county.” Her opponent, Matt Meyer is serving out his first term in the post after depriving three-term County Executive Tom Gordon of a second term. Gordon had earlier served two terms. There has been speculation that Gordon, a former county police chief, whose first term was marked by controversy, would run again. Meyer has not seen as many controversies as Gordon but has lately been taking heat for not doing more regarding sexual harassment claims involving a top former New Castle County Police official. Like his predecessors, Meyer has struggled on the labor relations front with county employee unions, while also dealing with a budget that is dependent on property taxes. Jones recently gained the endorsement of the Delaware Building Trades Council. Meyer, like his predecessors, has struggled with an unusual annual pay increase for the first decade of a county employee’s career. The system creates unrest among longer-term employees and makes budgeting more difficult when times get tougher. Meyer pushed through a three percent lodging tax during a period with a strong economy. Lodging revenues have been at close to zero since the coronavirus outbreak led to closings and single-digit occupancy rates. The lodging tax when coupled with the state tax amounts to the equivalent of an 11 percent sales tax in a state that touts its tax-free status. Looming on the horizon is a Chancery Court decision that says the current system of not having regular tax assessments on a property does not follow state law. Meyer and previous county executives have cited the high cost of such assessments as a reason for not modernizing the system.",0.0
1618436126,2020-05-27 18:23:53,"‘We all feel at risk’: 100,000 people dead from COVID-19 in the U.S.",https://whyy.org/npr_story_post/we-all-feel-at-risk-100000-people-dead-from-covid-19-in-the-u-s/,en,False,,82303,whyy.org,http://whyy.org/#spider,"The U.S. death toll from COVID-19 has reached a somber milestone: as of Wednesday afternoon, the highly infectious viral disease has taken more than 100,000 lives nationwide. Soaring from two known coronavirus fatalities in February to more than 58,000 in April, the tally of U.S. deaths — in a country with fewer than 5% of the world’s inhabitants — now accounts for nearly one-third of all the known lives lost worldwide to the pandemic. According to a mortality analysis by Johns Hopkins University’s Coronavirus Resource Center, about 6% of the nearly 1.7 million people who have tested positive for COVID-19 in the U.S. have now succumbed to the disease. Public health experts say the coronavirus has exposed the vulnerability of a wide range of Americans and the shortcomings of a U.S. health care system faced with a deadly pandemic. “What is different about this is, it is affecting all of us in a variety of ways, even if some of us are able to social distance in more effective ways than others,” says sociology professor Kathleen Cagney, who directs The University of Chicago’s Population Research Center. “But we all feel at risk.” Even some who are well acquainted with earlier health scourges in the U.S. were caught off guard by this one. “I think anybody who understands anything about infectious disease recognizes that we were going to sooner or later face something like this,” said John Barry, a professor at Tulane University School of Public Health And Tropical Medicine and author of “The Great Influenza: The Story Of The Deadliest Pandemic In History,” on NPR’s Fresh Air earlier this month. “But, you know, intellectually understanding it is one thing, and having it hit you is something quite different.” Demographic disparities in deaths People have died from the disease in all 50 states and most U.S. territories. But the impact has been felt unevenly. Demographic statistics that the CDC has posted of the first nearly 69,000 fatalities show some striking disparities: — The disease has been far deadlier for males than females. For age groups up to 75 years old, about twice as many men and boys have been killed by COVID-19 as have women and girls. — Older people have died in much greater numbers than those who are younger. Eighty percent of the known fatalities were at least 65 years old. — Racial and ethnic disparities in who is dying have also become apparent, even while tracking data that has been compiled by Johns Hopkins is still incomplete. In Alabama, for example, 44% of those killed by COVID-19 were black, in a state where fewer than 27% of its residents are African American. Similarly, while African Americans make up 14% of Michigan’s population, they account for 40% of that state’s COVID-19 fatalities. Native American communities have also been hit especially hard by the pandemic. In Arizona, Native Americans account for about 5% of the population but comprise nearly 17% of that state’s COVID-19 fatalities. The University of Chicago’s Cagney said that differences in socioeconomic status — and thus the ability to practice social distancing — are contributing to COVID-19’s uneven lethal impact. “If you look at the locations where people are disproportionately dying, they are in places that are lower income,” said Cagney. “They are places that likely have multiple residents in a single unit space. They are places where people rely on public transit and rely on services like big box locations where by entry alone you’re putting yourself at risk.” The degree of devastation wrought by the pathogen has taken even some public health experts by surprise. “Back in March, I did not think this would be possible — I was not expecting 100,000 deaths,” said Christopher Murray, director of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington. “I really believed we as a nation would have taken the decision to put in place social distancing and accepted the economic hardship that it’s creating, and that we would have stuck to it to get transmission down to a very low level,” he added. A study done this month by a Columbia University research team suggests the number of coronavirus deaths in the U.S. could have been considerably lower had Americans been told sooner to stay home and maintain social distancing. A “pre-print” version of the report — meaning it has yet to be peer reviewed — finds that “55% of reported deaths as of May 3, 2020 could have been avoided if the same control measures had been implemented just one week earlier.” By that measure, the nationwide death toll on that date of 65,307 could have instead stood at 29,410 — meaning nearly 36,000 lives might have been saved. “The lesson isn’t what this means for the next time we have a pandemic with a new virus,” says Jeffrey Shaman, one of the study’s co-authors. “The lesson is really what are we doing with this virus as we move forward that it isn’t going anywhere and that we still have to contend with it.” Asked on Thursday about the Columbia University study, President Trump dismissed it as “just a political hit job.” A roller coaster ride of presidential predictions The number of Americans killed by the pandemic appears to be a sensitive subject for a president seeking reelection in November. His predictions have gone up and down several times. “We have it totally under control. It’s one person coming in from China,” Trump told CNBC on Jan. 22, one day after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed the first COVID-19 case in the U.S. “We have it under control. It’s going to be just fine.” Five weeks later, on Feb. 27 — almost a month after the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a “public health emergency of international concern” — Trump continued to downplay the threat posed by the coronavirus. “You have 15 people, and the 15 within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero,” Trump declared at a White House coronavirus task force briefing. “That’s a pretty good job we’ve done.” But the numbers kept rising. By the end of March, with the WHO having already declared a global pandemic, Johns Hopkins was reporting more than 188,000 confirmed coronavirus infections in the U.S. and some 5,500 deaths. That was when Trump executed an abrupt U-turn in his effort to manage public expectations: for the first time, he broached the possibility that the pandemic — far from nearing zero — could indeed end up claiming 100,000 U.S. lives. Speaking from the White House Rose Garden on March 29, Trump cited new mortality projections by Dr. Deborah Birx, response coordinator for the White House Coronavirus Task Force, and Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. The two had predicted that if no preventive measures were taken, the pandemic could cause 2.2 million deaths in the U.S.; if such measures were taken, the toll could be between 100,000 and 200,000 deaths over an unspecified period of time. “And so, if we can hold that down, as we’re saying, to 100,000 — that’s a horrible number — maybe even less, but to 100,000,” Trump said, “so we have between 100- and 200,000 — we all, together, have done a very good job.” Three weeks later, amid mounting pressure from supporters to reopen the mostly quarantined economy, Trump was back to lowering public expectations about how many lives the pandemic might claim. “One is too many. But we’re going toward 50- or 60,000 people,” Trump declared on April 20. “That’s at the lower — as you know, the low number was supposed to be 100,000 people. We — we could end up at 50 to 60.” Trump appeared to be relying on one of the lowest of a dozen fatality estimates at the time, a range of 60,000 to 115,000 deaths modeled by the University of Washington’s IHME. But a week later, with social distancing measures being eased, the IHME practically doubled those projected numbers, forecasting that nearly 135,000 — and possibly as many as 242,890 — people would die by August in the U.S. from COVID-19. IHME’s Murray says the earlier calculations had been made assuming every state would hold off on loosening social distancing measures until new infections had dropped to a very low level. “But even before people started relaxing the mandates, people start changing their behavior as the national discussion about reopening the economy became pretty dominant,” says Murray, adding that his team realized keeping those mandates in place until early June “was just not going to happen. And so that’s what led to our major change in the modeling’s strategy and assumptions.” Trump, for his part, once again raised his predictions about how many lives in the U.S. the pandemic would claim. “I used to say 65,000,” he declared May 3 during a Fox News interview held at the Lincoln Memorial. “And now I’m saying 80 or 90, and it goes up and it goes up rapidly. But it’s still going to be, no matter how you look at it, at the very lower end of the plane.” By mid-May, all of the dozen forecasting models for COVID-19 deaths in the U.S. tracked by the CDC surpassed Trump’s latest predictions. “All forecast an increase in deaths in the coming weeks,” CDC Director Robert Redfield, in his first public comment on expected deaths, tweeted on May 15. Every one of those models, he added, predicted “a cumulative total exceeding 100,000 by June 1.” Many more deaths expected — and funerals With all 50 states now separately dropping some or all of their social distancing restrictions, health experts warn that the U.S. coronavirus death toll could climb much higher than the approximately 140,000 by August that many of them have been predicting. “Now we’re almost getting the worst of both worlds — we’re getting the economic hardship and we’re relaxing,” said the IHME’s Murray. “And it seems either now or in the fall, we’re going to have a big second wave and we’ll be right back to dealing with pressure on the hospital system and dealing with, when is the peak surge coming?” Columbia University’s Shaman said the U.S. has to keep suppressing the spread of COVID-19 while having an acceptable level of a functioning economy. “That’s the hard problem we’re trying to address as we try to figure that out and we loosen restrictions,” said Shaman. “If we have these flare-ups, we have to be willing to immediately recognize them and tamp back down and not wait and not dither. And that goes both for communities that have experienced the virus already and those that have not experienced it as much.” And there’s another challenge: Many of the 100,000 who have died have not yet had proper send-offs. “It’s been stunning to me that we have had as much death as we’ve had, with as little attention to all those deaths,” said Ashish Jha, director of the Harvard Global Health Institute. “I think one of the reasons we’ve had so little attention to all of this is because we’ve not had the kind of public mourning that comes with mass casualties like this.” Jha expects that as the U.S. opens up from its social isolation, those who have grieved privately will be holding postponed funerals, burials and other commemorations. “I think the sort of the weight of this calamity is going to become much more apparent to people in the upcoming days and weeks,” Jha added. “So people are going to, I think, really come to grips with how awful these last couple of months have been.”",0.0

Police said they were investigating Wednesday night’s death as a homicide and had a suspect in custody, but were still investigating what led to the shooting. Protesters began gathering in the early afternoon near the city’s 3rd Precinct station, in the southern part of the city where 46-year-old George Floyd died on Memorial Day after an officer knelt on his neck until he became unresponsive. News helicopter footage showed protesters milling in streets near the city’s 3rd Precinct station, with some running in and out of nearby stores. A Target, a Cub Foods, a Dollar Tree and an auto parts store all showed signs of damage and looting. As darkness fell, fire erupted in the auto parts store, and city fire crews rushed to control it. Protesters set other fires in the street. Officers could be seen surrounding the nearby precinct, not attempting to intervene in the looting. Multiple fires burned early Thursday at buildings and smoke hung over the city. Fire crews worked to put out flames.

Carney to re-open the state's businesses and beaches. Experts say if done too soon, this could increase the spread of the virus. Delaware News Journal Hundreds rallied in Dover on Friday afternoon, demanding the lifting of Gov. John Carney's emergency restrictions made during the coronavirus pandemic. Some Republican lawmakers also attended. At the same time, about 75 protesters tried to get Carney's attention outside the Carvel State Office Building in Wilmington where they promised legal challenges to his emergency authorities. In both rallies, protesters often stood less than 6 feet apart — the recommended distance between people to limit the spread of the virus — and did not wear face masks as police watched from the perimeters. Those who attended said Carney's executive orders during the pandemic have gone too far. Their primary demand was the reopening of businesses, but many expressed bitterness over a recent order for most people to wear face coverings in public and said it was an infringement on individual liberties. The Dover rally was largely organized by members of a Facebook group called Delawareans Against Excessive Quarantine. Within a week, the group had grown from 4,600 members to more than 6,600. PROTEST GROUP FORMED IN MID-APRIL: Here's why some are protesting Delaware's response to the coronavirus pandemic The rally was held outside Legislative Hall, which has been closed to the public for more than a month to prevent the spread of the coronavirus in the building. Lawmakers were originally scheduled to draft and vote on bills until June 30, but the session is postponed indefinitely due to the pandemic. Under an overcast sky, the rally had the air of a picnic, complete with American flags, children and dogs. Several men carried long guns slung across their backs. They declined to be interviewed.

Portio Ammon traveled to the Dover rally from Bethany Beach with her husband. “We need to open things up; let everyone be exposed the same as they are to the flu,” Portia Ammon said. “Everyone either gets it, gets over it. We build up an immunity. … We need to take care of the sick, bury the dead and move on.” The mood in Wilmington was angrier. CLOSE About 100 Delawareans turned out to the Carvel State Building to urge for an end to coronoavirus-related shutdowns of businesses and schools Friday. Delaware News Journal ""Where are the legislators?"" protester Chris Rowe said to the crowd, who shouted back, ""They're getting paid!"" OPINION: General Assembly continues essential work Rowe said the ""vast majority of the population"" was being punished with quarantine restrictions when the coronavirus had affected a ""minimal"" number of Delawareans. At a Friday afternoon press conference, Carney addressed the day’s protests, saying citizens have the right to protest — with some caveats. ”You always want to be careful, particularly with respect” to those rights, Carney said. “But they don't have the right to put other people at risk, which is what happens when they're gathering kind of illegally.” Carney said he understands the desire to reopen, noting that the state has made some good progress in flattening the curve. But “it's still a serious situation,” he said. Protests rise nationwide The Delaware protesters are part of a national movement as unemployment numbers continue to climb across America due to state lockdowns. Similar Facebook groups of people ""against excessive quarantine"" have formed in states such as California, New Hampshire, Vermont, Michigan and New Mexico. Many of them appear to be orchestrated by an Iowa family known for creating other, profitable anti-establishment Facebook groups that are pro-gun and anti-abortion. The Delaware group's leader, Lisa McCulley, said she founded the group and isn't working with outside organizations or protester groups in other states.

""We're not funded by billionaires or anybody else,"" he said. ""This is all coming out of our own pockets. ... We're here because we're Delawareans that care."" Governors in more than a dozen states such as Alabama, Idaho and Maine allowed state of emergency orders to expire on Friday, letting parts of their economies reopen. Delaware's restrictions won't expire until May 15 or until the coronavirus is no longer deemed a public health threat.

But people need to understand, it’s not time to let up.” Frustrations over emergency restrictions Addressing backlash over the emergency orders previously, Carney has said he hears the pain of business owners who can't reopen, but also must acknowledge the pain of families who have lost loved ones to the deadly virus.

And I can’t even go to Maryland to see my mom.” Some attendees in Dover blamed the restrictions on politics. “The left has gone too far this time,” said Wayne Dainty, who came to the Dover rally from Wilmington. He said the pandemic is a “hoax” and doesn’t agree with some of Carney’s actions, including beach closures.

Dover rally attendee Sharilyn Hummel, of Camden, said she wanted small businesses to reopen and for the government to “really stay out of our business.” She said she doesn’t know anyone who has been affected by the virus. REPUBLICANS WANT ECONOMY REOPENED NOW: Delaware House Republicans call on Carney to 'restart our economy now' despite coronavirus “Unfortunately, some places are hit really bad and they had to make adjustments or whatever, but we’re not that bad so I don’t know why we have to be locked down in our houses,” Hummel said. Sens. Bryant Richardson, R-Seaford; Dave Lawson, R-Marydel; and David Wilson, R-Cedar Creek Hundred, attended the Dover rally in support of the rally-goers. All three wore masks. DELAWARE'S SLOW REOPENING PLAN: Delaware starting talks on reopening economy amid coronavirus fight Looking out on the crowd, Wilson acknowledged that some of the rally-goers were not following social distancing guidelines. “The question is, are the guidelines really effective?” chimed in Lawson. “There’s no proof that those things are doing any good.” In a Thursday evening Facebook Live where she gave instructions about the rally, founder McCulley told protesters to bring a mask. CLOSE Despite warnings from health officials and the governor, protesters gathered at Legislative Hall in Dover. They want to immediately reopen the state's beaches, parks and businesses that have closed amid the pandemic. Delaware News Journal ""I’m bringing one; I’m not wearing it,"" McCulley said in the video. ""I’m going to bring it just in case, but I don’t plan on wearing one. I do have a medical condition."" A contingent of protesters said they’re preparing to sue the state to limit Carney’s emergency powers. Dan Menefee told the crowd in Wilmington he’s founded a group to raise “a warchest” of legal funding “to take this fight to the courts.” BUSINESS LOAN APPLICATION BACKLOG: Delaware struggles to keep up as hundreds of businesses apply for loans due to coronavirus “We are for social distancing; we’re for those that want to do that, to do that and for those that feel they’re within their liberties,” he said. “We believe there’s been an overreach of power by the governor. Our grievance is the overreach.” Menefee said he’s discussing a possible case with prominent Delaware attorney Thomas Neuberger. BLACK BUSINESS MEETING MET WITH RACISM: Zoom meeting for Delaware black businesses hacked with N-word, swastika and pornography Reached by phone for comment Friday afternoon, Neuberger said he has been “contacted by at least four groups considering major litigation in the federal courts” challenging Carney’s orders on constitutional grounds. He said he’d be “glad” to take “the right case with the right client” if the group could raise the money. When to reopen? The day before the protests, the 15-person Delaware House Republican Caucus penned a letter to Carney, a Democrat, demanding he ""restart our economy now."" The letter from the minority party lawmakers criticized the administration's blueprint for incrementally reopening the state's economy. Carney's plan, which is based on guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the White House, would require more widespread testing, hundreds of personnel to help trace the spread of the virus, and a steady decline in coronavirus cases over two weeks. It's unclear when Delaware will meet any of those standards. Buy Photo Reopen Delaware holds a rally to urge the easing or removal of coronavirus-related restrictions at the Carvel State Office building Friday. (Photo: WILLIAM BRETZGER, DELAWARE NEWS JOURNAL) More than a month ago, Carney declared a state of emergency that led to halting dine-in services at restaurants and closing a slew of other businesses deemed nonessential across the state. Residents have been ordered to stay home except for necessary trips and to wear a mask in many circumstances when they do venture outside. As a result of the business closures, nearly 80,000 Delawareans have filed for unemployment over six weeks, shattering historical records. The Department of Labor is struggling to keep up with the deluge, and many claimants are frustrated because phone lines are backed up and emails go unanswered.

The applications are overwhelming the Delaware Division of Small Business' small underwriting staff, leading to a backlog and weekslong waiting periods. State revenue is expected to plummet, and officials warn that public programs may get cut if they don't find the money in time.

They chanted for justice in Memphis. They stopped freeway traffic in Los Angeles. The death of George Floyd continued to ripple across the U.S. on Wednesday night as the calls became louder for the arrest of the white police officer who knelt on his neck for several minutes in a horrifying video that spread across social media this week. Meanwhile on Thursday, Ben Crump, attorney for Floyd's family, warned any instigators of violence in the Minneapolis protests: ""We don't need that. We need people focused on getting justice,"" he said. He is calling for an independent autopsy, saying he doesn't trust the city of Minneapolis. ""They offered him no humanity while keeping his knee on his neck. Members of the public were the only ones trying to de-escalate the situation. Not the police,"" Crump told CNN on Thursday. ""Keeping the knee on the neck for over 8 minutes – that is unconscionable."" While hundreds of protesters took to the streets, police chiefs from coast to coast expressed their outrage with Floyd's death. ""Do not defend the undefendable, attempt to justify the unjustifiable or excuse the inexcusable,"" Miami Police Chief Jorge Colina said on Twitter. ""George Floyd should be alive today."" ""The lack of compassion, use of excessive force, or going beyond the scope of the law, doesn't just tarnish our badge – it tears at the very fabric of race relations in this country,"" Los Angeles Police Chief Michel Moore said in a statement posted to Twitter. Minneapolis: Police, protesters clash; looters raid Target, Dollar Tree, other stores Protests in Minneapolis devolved into chaos on Wednesday night. Reports of fires came from around the city and videos of looters inside of stores quickly spread on social media. Several people shared video of people taking products from a local Target. A Cub Foods, a Dollar Tree and an AutoZone store also showed signs of damage and looting, and windows of businesses in nearby strip malls were reported to be smashed out. At least one person was killed. Police spokesman John Elder told USA TODAY that the department was investigating a homicide near the area where a reporter from the Star Tribune newspaper tweeted that a looter had been shot and killed by a pawn shop owner. One person was in custody early Thursday, the Star Tribune reported, but police wouldn't confirm if the victim was a looter. “The facts of what led up to the shooting are still being sorted out. We are truly in the infancy of this investigation,” Elder said. As the protests stretched into the evening, Police Chief Medaria Arradondo urged calm. In an interview with KMSP-TV, he noted the internal investigation as well as the FBI’s investigation of Floyd’s death and said they offer a chance at justice. “Justice historically has never come to fruition through some of the acts we’re seeing tonight, whether it’s the looting, the damage to property or other things,” he said. Memphis: George Floyd's death was 'nail in the unfortunate coffin for America' A silent demonstration to protest the death of Floyd, as well as Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery, turned into verbal confrontations with Memphis police and counter-protesters. The rally began with about 40 people holding signs reading “Black Lives Matter,” “Stop killing black people” and “Silence is violence.” Protesters were largely silent, with occasional chants of “no justice, no peace” and the names of black men and women who had been killed by police officers.

Los Angeles: Protesters block 101 freeway, smash windows of California Highway Patrol cruisers Hundreds of people protesting Floyd's death while in police custody blocked a Los Angeles freeway and shattered windows of California Highway Patrol cruisers in a rally organized by Black Lives Matter. Demonstrators gathered in the late afternoon on downtown streets and, eventually, dozens of them moved onto U.S. 101 despite police efforts to keep them from walking into the lanes. When a CHP patrol car arrived, demonstrators surrounded it. The car's window was smashed and it jerked forward and moved away with several protesters who had jumped onto the hood. Television news footage showed one man finally hopping or jumping from the side of the moving car and then flopping onto the ground. A second CHP car arrived and was attacked, with one demonstrator hurling what appeared to be a wooden skateboard through the back window before it moved off. At its rally's peak, hundreds of people gathered outside the Los Angeles County Hall of Justice. The demonstration was mostly peaceful and no arrests were immediately made, Los Angeles police Officer Mike Lopez said. Contributing: Corinne S. Kennedy, Micaela A.

PAUL, Minn. — A video showing a Minneapolis police officer kneeling on the neck of a handcuffed man repeatedly saying “I can’t breathe,” and who appears to lose consciousness or die while being pinned down, is “gut wrenching and deeply disturbing,” Archbishop Bernard A. Hebda of St. Paul and Minneapolis said in a May 27 statement. “The sadness and pain are intense,” Archbishop Hebda said of the circumstances surrounding the May 25 death of George Floyd. “Let us pray for comfort for his grieving family and friends, peace for a hurting community and prudence while the process moves forward. We need a full investigation that results in rightful accountability and veritable justice.” A bystander filmed part of police’s confrontation with the 46-year-old Floyd, an African American restaurant worker from St. Louis Park, Minnesota. who was reportedly arrested on suspicion of forgery. Floyd was pronounced dead at Hennepin County Medical Center. The four officers involved Floyd’s arrest have been fired, and the FBI is conducting a federal civil rights investigation. The officer who pinned Floyd is white. The death inspired hundreds of people to protest May 26 at the intersection where police officers subdued Floyd. Some protesters vandalized police vehicles and the building for the Minneapolis Police Third Precinct building, where it is believed the officers involved worked. Police employed tear gas and flash grenades to disperse the crowd, and some protesters hurled rocks and water bottles at police. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey called May 27 for charges to be brought against the officer who pinned Floyd with his knee. Violent protests and looting continued the night of May 27 and led to the shooting death of a man. Frey called for calm, saying, “We cannot let tragedy beget more tragedy.” He has asked the National Guard to come in to help keep the peace. In his statement, Archbishop Hebda called for respect for all people and asked for prayers for Floyd and his family. “Particularly at this time when human fragility has been brought into focus by the COVID-19 pandemic, we are called to respect the worth and dignity of each individual, whether they be civilians in need of protection or law enforcement officers charged with providing that protection,” he said. “All human life is sacred,” he said. “Please join our Catholic community in praying for George Floyd and his family, and working for that day when ‘love and truth will meet (and) justice and peace will kiss’ (Psalm 85).” Archbishop Hebda also posted on Twitter May 27 that he offered Mass that morning for Floyd and his family. “In these days before Pentecost, we pray that the Holy Spirit, the Breath of God, might help ease our collective pain, promote justice, and bring about greater respect for all human life.” In a video message posted May 27, the pastor of St. Paul’s historically black Catholic parish called on his parishioners “to agitate” their community, Church and world for racial justice and healing. Father Erich Rutten, pastor of St. Peter Claver in St. Paul, shared his vision for his parish following Floyd’s death. And while Father Rutten said he doesn’t know all the details of the situation, the video posted online, now well circulated, showing a white police officer kneeling on Floyd’s neck while Floyd, who is handcuffed, repeatedly said he couldn’t breathe, “seems so egregious.” “I am saddened. I am sickened. I am angered. And I am tired of such things happening again and again,” Father Rutten said. “How long, O Lord, must we endure such things?” Some people think white supremacy is a concept for university or talk radio debate, he said, but “here is a case where white supremacy has cost someone their life.” “The misguided idea that white people can somehow push people around, or that we own this country, or that we own Minneapolis leads to terrible disrespect, leads to poverty, leads to, in this case, violence, and in many cases, violence,” said Father Rutten, who is white. In contrast, God’s love, as revealed by Jesus, shows people that they are all children of one God, equally subject to Christ the King, he said. “We are all brothers and sisters.” In other reaction, the General Council of the Dominican Sisters of Adrian, Michigan, said Floyd’s “anguished cry, ‘I can’t breathe,’ as an officer pressed his knee into his neck, harkened back to the cries six years ago of Eric Garner, another unarmed African American man who died in New York police custody.” Floyd’s cry “brings to mind the long and growing list of African Americans who have been killed, seemingly for no reason other than being black,” the women religious said, and quoted Mayor Frey: “Being black in America should not be a death sentence.” The Dominicans said they were “deeply troubled and distressed by the violent assault” on Floyd, resulting in his death. “Our Christian faith tradition holds that we are all one people, one body; each made in the image of God,” their statement said. The Dominicans referenced a videotaped sermon by the Rev. Otis Moss III, a prominent Chicago pastor, addressing another recent fatal shooting, that of a 25-year-old black man, for Ahmaud Arbery, in Georgia. Three white men are in custody and face a hearing on murder charges. In the sermon, titled “The Cross and the Lynching Tree: A Requiem for Ahmaud Arbery,” Rev. Moss “speaks of racism as a virus that has infected the spirit and soul of our country,” the Dominicans said. He said Arbery’s death “is not an anomaly but a historical pattern of behavior that binds every American to an unexamined history of our nation.” “Rev. Moss powerfully summarizes that unexamined history in his 22-minute sermon. It is a history that we Americans must acknowledge — and then set ourselves on a soul-searching course, powered by courage and love, to make real the ideals of freedom and equality on which our nation was founded,” the women religious said.

They chanted for justice in Memphis. They stopped freeway traffic in Los Angeles. The death of George Floyd continued to ripple across the U.S. on Wednesday night as the calls became louder for the arrest of the white police officer who knelt on his neck for several minutes in a horrifying video that spread across social media this week. Meanwhile on Thursday, Ben Crump, attorney for Floyd's family, warned any instigators of violence in the Minneapolis protests: ""We don't need that. We need people focused on getting justice,"" he said. He is calling for an independent autopsy, saying he doesn't trust the city of Minneapolis. ""They offered him no humanity while keeping his knee on his neck. Members of the public were the only ones trying to de-escalate the situation. Not the police,"" Crump told CNN on Thursday. ""Keeping the knee on the neck for over 8 minutes – that is unconscionable."" While hundreds of protesters took to the streets, police chiefs from coast to coast expressed their outrage with Floyd's death. ""Do not defend the undefendable, attempt to justify the unjustifiable or excuse the inexcusable,"" Miami Police Chief Jorge Colina said on Twitter. ""George Floyd should be alive today."" ""The lack of compassion, use of excessive force, or going beyond the scope of the law, doesn't just tarnish our badge – it tears at the very fabric of race relations in this country,"" Los Angeles Police Chief Michel Moore said in a statement posted to Twitter. Minneapolis: Police, protesters clash; looters raid Target, Dollar Tree, other stores Protests in Minneapolis devolved into chaos on Wednesday night. Reports of fires came from around the city and videos of looters inside of stores quickly spread on social media. Several people shared video of people taking products from a local Target. A Cub Foods, a Dollar Tree and an AutoZone store also showed signs of damage and looting, and windows of businesses in nearby strip malls were reported to be smashed out. At least one person was killed. Police spokesman John Elder told USA TODAY that the department was investigating a homicide near the area where a reporter from the Star Tribune newspaper tweeted that a looter had been shot and killed by a pawn shop owner. One person was in custody early Thursday, the Star Tribune reported, but police wouldn't confirm if the victim was a looter. “The facts of what led up to the shooting are still being sorted out. We are truly in the infancy of this investigation,” Elder said. As the protests stretched into the evening, Police Chief Medaria Arradondo urged calm. In an interview with KMSP-TV, he noted the internal investigation as well as the FBI’s investigation of Floyd’s death and said they offer a chance at justice. “Justice historically has never come to fruition through some of the acts we’re seeing tonight, whether it’s the looting, the damage to property or other things,” he said. Memphis: George Floyd's death was 'nail in the unfortunate coffin for America' A silent demonstration to protest the death of Floyd, as well as Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery, turned into verbal confrontations with Memphis police and counter-protesters. The rally began with about 40 people holding signs reading “Black Lives Matter,” “Stop killing black people” and “Silence is violence.” Protesters were largely silent, with occasional chants of “no justice, no peace” and the names of black men and women who had been killed by police officers. Passing drivers — and one ambulance — honked in support and waved or gave thumbs-up. Within an hour, however, the protesters were met by two counter-protesters, who identified themselves as members of the Facebook group Confederate 901. Theryn C. Bond, a prominent local activist and former Memphis City Council candidate, confronted the counter-protesters, who occasionally jeered at the crowd to ""go out for a jog"" — a reference to Aubrey's slaying. ""I was so impressed to see so many white allies,"" Bond said. ""Because sometimes we think, 'Everybody doesn't get it.' And I think with the recent murder of George Floyd by police... I think this was the proverbial nail in the unfortunate coffin for America to really understand what we mean when we say, 'Black Lives Matter.'"" Floyd's death this week is the latest in a string of violence against black people. Taylor was shot and killed in her Kentucky home by officers executing a ""no-knock"" search warrant, while Arbery was shot and killed while jogging after being pursued by two white men who later said they thought he was a burglary suspect.

Los Angeles: Protesters block 101 freeway, smash windows of California Highway Patrol cruisers Hundreds of people protesting Floyd's death while in police custody blocked a Los Angeles freeway and shattered windows of California Highway Patrol cruisers in a rally organized by Black Lives Matter. Demonstrators gathered in the late afternoon on downtown streets and, eventually, dozens of them moved onto U.S. 101 despite police efforts to keep them from walking into the lanes. When a CHP patrol car arrived, demonstrators surrounded it. The car's window was smashed and it jerked forward and moved away with several protesters who had jumped onto the hood. Television news footage showed one man finally hopping or jumping from the side of the moving car and then flopping onto the ground. A second CHP car arrived and was attacked, with one demonstrator hurling what appeared to be a wooden skateboard through the back window before it moved off. At its rally's peak, hundreds of people gathered outside the Los Angeles County Hall of Justice. The demonstration was mostly peaceful and no arrests were immediately made, Los Angeles police Officer Mike Lopez said. Contributing: Corinne S. Kennedy, Micaela A.

Delaware News Journal Eagles quarterback Carson Wentz, typically not one to speak out about issues involving race, wrote ""the institutional racism in this country breaks my heart and needs to stop"" in a social media post Thursday night. Wentz was referring to the death of George Floyd, an African-American, at the hands of a white police officer in Minneapolis on Monday.

""I'm never going to act like I know what the black community goes through or even has gone through already. ""I’ll never know the feeling of having to worry about my kids going outside because of their skin color ... I don’t understand the society we live in that doesn’t value all human life.

ROOKIE RANKINGS: With no spring practices, these Eagles' rookies will be counted on to contribute this season Wentz wasn't the only white Eagles player to speak out Thursday night. Tight end Zach Ertz also posted a statement about Floyd, saying he has been trying for the past few days ""to come up with the perfect words in regards to George Floyd and the tragic murder that took place in Minnesota."" Ertz added: ""What I do know is that I am so unbelievably sorry. I am sorry for the pain and hurt that the African American community has endured by another human, and more than anything, I am sorry that you feel that you are alone in this situation."" Several African American athletes have spoken out about Floyd's death, including former Eagles safety Malcolm Jenkins, who has often commented about racial issues. Jenkins posted a video about the death wearing a T-shirt with the words, ""Charge and Convict The Murderers of George Floyd.""

Many players are convinced that Kaepernick, who hasn't played in the NFL since 2016, was blackballed by the NFL for kneeling during the anthem. Jenkins had often said that it'll take white players joining in the protests for the message of social injustices to gain traction. During the 2017 season, Eagles defensive end Chris Long, who is white, would put his arm on Jenkins' shoulder as he raised his fist. On Thursday, Wentz and Ertz made a similar symbolic gesture.

Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman said Chauvin was in custody and facing third-degree murder and manslaughter charges. Subsequent charges are possible and charges for the other officers involved are anticipated, Freeman said. Floyd's family released a statement following the arrest, calling it a ""welcome but overdue step on the road to justice."" The family said they wanted to see Chauvin charged with first-degree murder, as well as charges for the three other officers. The arrest comes after Minneapolis residents awoke Friday to smoke billowing, fires burning and police lining their streets after another intense night of protests following Floyd's death. Protests, some violent, also cropped up across the nation and are continuing in many cities Friday night. More than 1,000 protesters shut down the Hennepin Avenue Bridge over the Mississippi River in Minneapolis in a peaceful demonstration before heading for Interstate 35 on Friday night. The crowd marched to the bridge, where they met with a group led by Korey Dean Sr., P.J. Hill and former Iowa State basketball player Royce White. Dean asked the protesters to adhere to the day's 8 p.m. curfew, which was put in place in response to days of ""civil disturbance."" Stay up-to-date on the George Floyd story by signing up for USA TODAY's Daily Briefing. Here are the latest developments: Vice President Joe Biden said he spoke with Floyd’s family: ""With our complacency and silence, we are complicit in perpetuating these cycles of violence."" Floyd and Chauvin knew each other before the fatal encounter - they worked together at a bar, a city official and a bar owner said. Floyd's family has hired a medical examiner to conduct an independent autopsy, their attorney Ben Crump says. President Donald Trump criticized the city's mayor, called protesters ""thugs"" and said ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts."" Twitter later put a public interest notice on that tweet saying it violated rules about ""glorifying violence."" A CNN reporter and crew were arrested early Friday and later released. Protests and rallies took place across the country overnight. In Louisville, Kentucky, a protest to demand justice for Breonna Taylor, who was shot and killed by police in March, turned violent. Seven people were shot but are expected to recover. Here's what we know Friday: More protests sweep the nation after Chauvin's arrest Speaking to a large group of protesters on Friday, Minneapolis activist Kon Johnson, 45, called for calm — but said he understood why people were lashing out. “When you’ve held captive, you end up turning against each other,"" he said, urging his fellow residents to exercise their voting rights to change the system he said oppresses people. “What is it going to take to get people to listen? They say don’t incite violence, but no one is listening. What does it take to get them to listen? I mean, do we have to take this to the suburbs? To the capital?"" he asked. ""We can’t keep burning stuff down."" Johnson added Chauvin's arrest was just a first step. ""I don't want to burn down (expletive) either,"" he said ""I don't. But guess what? It's gonna happen if this fool does not get life in jail."" Protests also persisted across the nation. The White House was put on lockdown after protests reached the nation's capital, a spokesman confirmed to USA TODAY. Protests in New York, Atlanta and Chicago, to name a few places, also continued. Minneapolis, Saint Paul face curfews In response to ""widespread civil unrest and unlawful activity"" in the city over recent nights, Gov. Tim Walz, along with the mayors of Minneapolis and Saint Paul, imposed a nighttime curfew on all public places in the Twin Cities, including streets and roads, alleys, highways, driveways, sidewalks, parks and more. The curfew goes into effect Friday at 8 p.m. until 6 a.m., then again at the same time Saturday night. According to the emergency order, all law enforcement, fire and medical personnel, news media and other city and state officials were exempt from the curfew, along with people seeking care, fleeing dangerous circumstances or experiencing homelessness. Violation of the order would result in a misdemeanor offense and is punishable by a fine up to $1,000 or imprisonment up to 90 days, according to the order. The mayor of bordering Roseville announced on Twitter that, ""out of an abundance of caution,"" he had also imposed a curfew. County attorney says Chauvin facing murder, manslaughter charges Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman said that his office was still reviewing evidence in Floyd's death but they have ""sufficient admissible evidence to prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt"" on both a third-degree murder and a manslaughter charge. Freeman said the charges were similar to those filed against former Minneapolis police officer Mohamed Noor in the shooting death of Justine Damond. Asked why Chauvin was not arrested and held before charges filed, Freeman said, ""This is by far the fastest we've ever charged a police officer."" Freeman would not comment on what specific piece of evidence led to Chauvin's arrest but said that his office had reviewed footage of Floyd's death and the officer's body-worn camera, spoken to witnesses and obtained a preliminary report from the medical examiner. ""We have now been able to put together the evidence that we need. Even as late as yesterday afternoon, we didn't have all that we needed,"" Freeman said. Freeman said he would not speculate about the three other officers involved in Floyd's arrest but said he anticipates charges. Complaint provides new details from body cam footage A criminal complaint that references body-worn cameras worn by the four now-former officers involved in the incident sheds some additional light on what happened on Memorial Day in the moments before and after Floyd's death. The Hennepin County Attorney's complaint said Chauvin had his knee on Floyd’s neck for 8 minutes and 46 seconds, including two minutes and 53 seconds after Floyd was non-responsive. The complaint lines up with what many nationwide have seen in video of the incident and adds context for what other officers at the scene were doing. One officer on the scene expressed worry for Floyd and asked Chauvin twice if Floyd should be rolled onto his side. After Floyd became unresponsive, an officer checked for a pulse and said he didn't find one, according to the complaint. Chauvin kept his knee on Floyd's neck for an additional two minutes after that, according to the complaint. The report adds the type of restraint Chauvin used ""with a subject in a prone position is inherently dangerous."" Read more about the complaint here. Family seeks first-degree murder charge The family of George Floyd released a statement Friday calling for officials to revise the charges against Chauvin. ""We expected a first-degree murder charge. We want a first-degree murder charge. And we want to see the other officers arrested,"" the statement said. ""We call on authorities to revise the charges to reflect the true culpability of this officer."" Activists echoed the call, saying that one arrest was not enough. At a press conference inside Minneapolis city hall, attended by former NBA player Stephen Jackson and actor Jamie Foxx, community members called for the arrest of all four officers involved in the incident. ""We are not satisfied with one officer,"" said lawyer and minister Nekima Levy Armstrong. ""All of them were complicit in his murder, and they all need to (be) held accountable, just as if it was four black men that killed somebody."" Barr says federal investigation 'proceeding quickly' Attorney General William Barr said the Justice Department is ""proceeding quickly"" with its investigation on Floyd's death. ""The video images of the incident that ended with death of Mr. Floyd, while in custody of Minneapolis police officers, were harrowing to watch and deeply disturbing,"" Barr said Friday. The Justice Department has launched a parallel investigation on whether the officers committed civil rights violations. Barr said state officials will first make charging decisions before the Justice Department does. – Kristine Phillips Biden, Obama speak out Former Vice President Joe Biden, in a video address Friday, said he spoke with George Floyd’s family, saying, ""It's time for us to take a hard look at the uncomfortable truths. It's time for us to face that deep open wound in this nation."" Added Biden: ""With our complacency and silence, we are complicit in perpetuating these cycles of violence."" In a statement, former President Barack Obama said he, his friends and millions of other Americans share ""anguish"" after Floyd's death. While it's natural to want the U.S. to return to ""normal"" amid the coronavirus, Obama said ""normal"" for many Americans is ""being treated differently on account of race."" ""This shouldn't be 'normal' in 2020 America. It can't be 'normal,' "" he added. ""If we want our children to grow up in a nation that lives up to its highest ideals, we can and must be better."" The protest:What one reporter saw during George Floyd protests — until he was temporarily blinded by pepper spray Minnesota Gov. Walz: 'It's time for us to clean our streets' Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz called on the public to end violent protests and looting that take away peaceful demonstrations honoring Floyd. ""As we put a presence in the street to restore order, it is to open that space to seek justice and heal after what happened,"" Walz said at a news conference. Walz addressed criticism about a lack of police presence overnight during the protests, saying that the local leadership needed to make specific requests as to the mission for state troopers and national guard members. ""You will not see that tonight,"" Walz said. ""There was no social control. ... That is an abject failure that cannot happen."" ""The chapter that has been written this week is one of our darkest chapters,"" Walz said. Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison echoed the governor's message of addressing structural problems within policing in the state, adding that prosecution of the officers involved in Floyd's arrest alone will not lead to justice. ""We're not just going to fix the windows and sweep up the glass,"" he said. ""We're going to fix a broken society."" Floyd, Chauvin worked security at same bar Floyd andChauvin knew each other before the fatal encounter during which Chauvin held his knee to Floyd's neck for more than eight minutes as Floyd said he could not breathe, a city official and a bar owner said. Minneapolis City Council Vice President Andrea Jenkins told CNN and MSNBC that Floyd and Chauvin were long-time co-workers who worked security at the same bar, El Nuevo Rodeo. Speaking with KSTP-TV, former bar owner Maya Santamaria said Chauvin worked off-duty security outside for 17 years while Floyd worked inside the bar. Santamaria said she sold the club a few months ago. More on Derek Chauvin:Minneapolis police at center of George Floyd’s death had a history of complaints Floyd's family arranges independent autopsy George Floyd's family has hired a medical examiner to conduct an independent autopsy, the family’s lawyer said Friday. “We’ve just spoken recently with the district attorney,” attorney Ben Crump said in a press conference. “We’re going to take custody back of his body, and we’re bringing in Dr. Michael Baden to perform an independent autopsy.” Crump said the family suspected city authorities of trying to establish a false narrative through the autopsy report. The preliminary autopsy report found ""no physical findings that support a diagnosis of traumatic asphyxia or strangulation,"" according to the criminal complaint released Friday. “The family does not trust anything coming from the Minneapolis Police Department. How can they?” Crump said. Baden is a forensic pathologist known for investigation high-profile deaths, including that of Jeffrey Epstein. Baden did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Also Friday, the families of Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery and Floyd issued a joint call for a congressional hearing and a national task force aimed at ending racial violence and increasing police accountability in the U.S. “While we are grateful for the outpouring of love and support, it’s important that now – more than ever – we use our voices to enact change, demand accountability within our justice system and keep the legacies of Breonna, Ahmaud and George alive,” the families said in a joint statement. George Floyd video adds to trauma:'When is the last time you saw a white person killed online?' More news on the police death of George Floyd CNN reporter Omar Jimenez and crew released after being arrested Gov. Tim Walz apologized Friday for the arrest of a CNN reporter and crew. ""I take full responsibility. There is absolutely no reason something like this should happen,"" he said. Correspondent Omar Jimenez was reporting live on ""New Day"" when police advanced toward him and his crew. Jimenez told police that he was a reporter, showed his credentials and asked where they would like him and the crew to stand so they could continue reporting and be out of their way. ""Put us back where you want us. We are getting out of your way,"" Jimenez said. ""Wherever you want us, we will go. We were just getting out of your way when you were advancing through the intersection."" A response by police could not be heard as Jimenez explained the scene. An officer then told Jimenez he was under arrest. Jimenez asked why he was under arrest, but was taken from the scene. The rest of the crew was then arrested as the live shot continued with the camera on the ground. CNN said later Friday that Jimenez had been released and that Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz apologized for his arrest. ""There was a moment, minutes after it happened where things started to sink in a little bit,"" Jimenez said on CNN after his release. ""I was just as confused as you."" ""They eventually came back with our belongings ... unclipped our handcuffs and that is when we were led out,"" he said, adding, ""There was no, 'Sorry, this is a big misunderstanding.' "" Protest erupted in Louisville with 7 shot overnight At least seven people were shot during a protest in Louisville, Kentucky, over the police shooting of Breonna Taylor, who was killed in her apartment while sleeping. Gunfire erupted after hundreds of protesters took to the streets demanding justice for Taylor – one of several deaths of unarmed African Americans drawing national attention in recent weeks. It began as a peaceful demonstration with several hundred people marching through downtown, chanting Taylor's name and calling for the officers involved in her death to face charges. But as the sun set, tensions rose. Police in riot gear clashed with hundreds of protesters outside of Louisville Metro Hall, officers releasing clouds of tear gas and firing a barrage of rubber bullets at the crowd. By the end of the evening, dozens of vehicles and buildings had sustained property damage. Crowds shook a police prisoner transport van, nearly toppling it. As of Friday afternoon, the police department said there were no leads in the case. – Mandy McLaren, Darcy Costello, Cameron Teague Robinson, Bailey Loosemore and Sarah Ladd Breonna Taylor shooting:What to know about the FBI, Louisville police investigations Contributing: Associated Press; Jordan Culver, Joel Shannon, Erick Smith, Savannah Behrmann, Cara Richardson, Steve Kiggins and Heather Tucker, USA TODAY; Tyler J.

1620247246,2020-05-29 08:40:33,Protesters torch Minneapolis police station in violent night,https://whyy.org/articles/minneapolis-police-station-torched-amid-george-floyd-protest/,en,False,,82303,whyy.org,http://whyy.org/#spider,"The police officer who was seen on video kneeling on the neck of George Floyd, a handcuffed black man who died in custody after pleading that he could not breathe, was arrested Friday and charged with murder in a case that sparked protests across the United States and violence in Minneapolis. Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman said Derek Chauvin was charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. Freeman did not provide immediate details, but said a criminal complaint would be made available later Friday and that more charges were possible. In the video, Chauvin is seen kneeling on Floyd’s neck as Floyd is on the ground. He gradually becomes motionless as Chauvin and three other officers ignore bystanders’ shouts to get off him. Freeman said the investigation continues into the other three officers, but that authorities “felt it appropriate to focus on the most dangerous perpetrator.” Freeman highlighted the “extraordinary speed” in charging the case just four days after Floyd’s death, but also defended himself against questions about why it did not happen sooner. He said his office needed time to put together evidence, including what he called the “horrible” video by a bystander. He said he would not bring a case unless he had enough evidence to prove the charges beyond a reasonable doubt. Protests in Minneapolis escalated in violence on Thursday, when demonstrators torched a police station that officers had abandoned. “I’m not insensitive to what happened in the streets,” Freeman said. “My own home has been picketed regularly.” All four officers who were at the scene of Floyd’s death were fired the next day. After the charges were announced, protesters outside the government center chanted, “All four got to go.” News of the arrest came moments after Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz acknowledged the “abject failure” of the response to the protests and called for swift justice for officers involved. Walz said the state would take over the response to the violence and that it’s time to show respect and dignity to those who are suffering. “Minneapolis and St. Paul are on fire. The fire is still smoldering in our streets. The ashes are symbolic of decades and generations of pain, of anguish unheard,” Walz said, adding. “Now generations of pain is manifesting itself in front of the world — and the world is watching.” The governor cited a call he received from a state senator who described her district “on fire, no police, no firefighters, no social control, constituents locked in houses wondering what they were going to do. That is an abject failure that cannot happen.” His comments came the morning after protesters torched a police station that officers abandoned during a third night of violence. Livestream video showed protesters entering the building, where intentionally set fires activated smoke alarms and sprinklers. President Donald Trump threatened action, tweeting “when the looting starts, the shooting starts,” which prompted a warning from Twitter for “glorifying violence.” Protestors demonstrate outside of a burning fast food restaurant, Friday, May 29, 2020, in Minneapolis. (AP Photo/John Minchillo) The governor faced tough questions after National Guard leader Maj. Gen. Jon Jensen blamed a lack of clarity about the Guard’s mission for a slow response. Walz said the state was in a supporting role and that it was up to city leaders to run the situation. Walz said it became apparent as the 3rd Precinct was lost that the state had to step in, which happened at 12:05 a.m. Requests from the cities for resources “never came,” he said. “You will not see that tonight, there will be no lack of leadership,” Walz said. On Friday morning, nearly every building in the shopping district around the abandoned police station had been vandalized, burned or looted. National Guard members were in the area, with several of them lined up, keeping people away from the police station. Dozens of volunteers swept up broken glass in the street, doing what they could to help. Dean Hanson, 64, lives in a subsidized housing unit nearby, which is home to many older residents. He said his building lost electricity overnight, and residents were terrified as they watched mobs of people run around their neighborhood, with no apparent intervention. “I can’t believe this is happening here,” he said. Dozens of fires were also set in nearby St. Paul, where nearly 200 businesses were damaged or looted. Protests spread across the U.S., fueled by outrage over Floyd’s death, and years of violence against African Americans at the hands of police. Demonstrators clashed with officers in New York and blocked traffic in Columbus, Ohio, and Denver. Trump threatened to bring Minneapolis “under control,” calling the protesters “thugs” and tweeting that “when the looting starts, the shooting starts.” The tweet drew another warning from Twitter, which said the comment violated the platform’s rules, but the company did not remove it. Trump also blasted the “total lack of leadership” in Minneapolis. A visibly tired and frustrated Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey made his first public appearance of the night early Friday at City Hall and took responsibility for evacuating the precinct, saying it had become too dangerous for officers. As Frey continued, a reporter cut across loudly with a question: “What’s the plan here?” “With regard to?” Frey responded. Then he added: “There is a lot of pain and anger right now in our city. I understand that … What we have seen over the past several hours and past couple of nights here in terms of looting is unacceptable.” He defended the city’s lack of engagement with looters — only a handful of arrests across the first two nights of violence — and said, “We are doing absolutely everything that we can to keep the peace.” He said National Guard members were stationed in locations to help stem looting, including at banks, grocery stores and pharmacies. The Minnesota State Patrol arrested a CNN television crew early Friday as the journalists reported on the unrest. While live on air, CNN reporter Omar Jimenez was handcuffed and led away. A producer and a photojournalist for CNN were also taken away in handcuffs. The Minnesota State Patrol said the journalists were among four people arrested as troopers were “clearing the streets and restoring order,” and they were released after being confirmed to be media members. CNN said on Twitter that the arrests were “a clear violation of their First Amendment rights.” Walz publicly apologized on Friday. Attorney Benjamin Crump, who is representing members of Floyd’s family, called for an independent investigation, and said he asked to take custody of Floyd’s body to have an independent autopsy performed. Floyd said that talk of a heart condition or asthma is irrelevant because Floyd was walking and breathing before his contact with police. The doctor who will do the autopsy is Michael Baden, former chief medical examiner of New York City, who was hired to do an autopsy for Eric Garner as well. In New York City, protesters defied New York’s coronavirus prohibition on public gatherings Thursday, clashing with police, while demonstrators blocked traffic in downtown Denver and downtown Columbus. A day earlier, demonstrators had taken to the streets in Los Angeles and Memphis. About 10 protesters went to a Florida home believed to belong to Chauvin. The Orange County Sheriff’s Office tweeted Friday that Chauvin was not at the residence and has no plans to be in the area. In Louisville, Kentucky, police confirmed that at least seven people had been shot Thursday night as protesters demanded justice for Breonna Taylor, a black woman who was fatally shot by police in her home in March. In Mississippi, the mayor of the community of Petal resisted calls to resign following his remarks about Floyd’s death. Hal Marx, a Republican, asked on Twitter: “Why in the world would anyone choose to become a police officer in our society today?” In a follow-up tweet, he said he “didn’t see anything unreasonable.” The city on Thursday released a transcript of the 911 call that brought police to the grocery store where Floyd was arrested. The caller described someone paying with a counterfeit bill, with workers rushing outside to find the man sitting on a van. The caller described the man as “awfully drunk” and said he was “not in control of himself.” Asked by the 911 operator whether the man was “under the influence of something,” the caller said: “Something like that, yes. He is not acting right.” Police said Floyd matched the caller’s description of the suspect. State and federal authorities are investigating Floyd’s death. The owner of a popular Latin nightclub said that Floyd and Chauvin both worked as security guards at the club as recently as the end of last year, but it’s not clear whether they worked together. Chauvin worked at the El Nuevo Rodeo club as an off-duty security guard for nearly two decades, but Floyd had only worked there more recently for about a dozen events that featured African-American music, Maya Santamaria told The Associated Press. Santamaria said if Chauvin had recognized Floyd, “he might have given him a little more mercy.” Santamaria, who sold the venue within the past two months, said Chauvin got along well with the regular Latino customers, but did not like to work the African American nights. When he did, and there was a fight, he would spray people with mace and call for police backup and half-dozen squad cars would soon show up, something she felt was unjustified “overkill.” Associated Press writers Steve Karnowski, Jeff Baenen and Doug Glass in Minneapolis, Gretchen Ehlke in Milwaukee, and Aaron Morrison in New York contributed to this report.",0.0

WATCH: Wilmington protest held in response to George Floyd's death This weekend, Wilmington residents will join them, adding Delaware's largest city to the growing number of municipalities that are seeing protests in the wake of Floyd's death. The first rally, planned for Saturday at Rodney Square, is being organized by Food Not Bombs Wilmington and the city's Black Lives Matter movement. Organizers said the peaceful event, which will be held from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m., is intended to show solidarity with Floyd's family and the ongoing protests in Minneapolis. It's being called the ""I can't breathe"" rally, said Derrick Johnson, a community activist better known around Wilmington as ""Pastor D."" ""We're sick and tired of the vestiges of the Jim Crow era,"" Johnson said. ""There has to be a voice in the community that says, 'No, we won't go back, we will not accept this.' In this rally, we are standing in solidarity with not just blacks, but whites across the country who (decry) these situations."" RELATED: Minneapolis police at center of George Floyd’s death had a history of complaints The second event, set for Sunday, will also protest Floyd's death, but it's not immediately clear who is organizing that rally. A Facebook page called ""Protest For George Floyd"" says it will be held at 6 p.m. outside Wilmington's Louis L. Redding City County Building at 800 N. French St. A description for that event says ""Bring out your signs. We’ll protest, march, chant, until we get the change we demand"" but provides little other detail. The Facebook page did not immediately respond to Delaware Online/The News Journal's inquiries about the protest. Organizers for Saturday's rally also ask attendees to bring signs, but remind protesters to ""adhere to state COVID social distancing and protective mask guidelines.""

(Photo: Richard Tsong-Taatarii, Star Tribune via AP) Wilmington's planned protests come days after Floyd's death on Monday while in the custody of Minneapolis Police. Officials said Floyd had been detained because he matched the description of someone who tried to pay with a counterfeit bill at a convenience store, and the 46-year-old resisted arrest. A bystander’s disturbing video shows Officer Derek Chauvin, who is white, kneeling on Floyd’s neck as he begs for air and slowly stops talking and moving. Throughout the eight minutes that Chauvin keeps his knee on Floyd's neck, Floyd can be heard saying again and again, ""I can't breathe."" The words are reminiscent of Eric Garner, the black man who died in Staten Island after a New York Police Department officer wrapped his arm around his neck and wrestled him to the ground. George Floyd died May 25 after a Minneapolis police officer kneeled on his neck while arresting him. (Photo: Photo courtesy of Christina Dawson) In that case, Garner repeated ""I can't breathe"" 11 times before becoming unconscious. Garner's mother said Floyd's death on Monday was ""déjà vu."" WATCH: Rev. Al Sharpton and Gwen Carr address crowd where George Floyd died Chauvin and three other officers who stood by while Floyd slowly died were fired almost immediately after video of the incident was shared on social media. On Friday, prosecutors announced Chauvin had been charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter for Floyd's death. An investigation into the other three officers is ongoing. In Wilmington, Johnson said he hopes Saturday's event will send a message that the community is fed up.

Police had barricaded numerous entry points to the facility. Protesters faced the police line yelling chants, waving signs and at times hurling insults. Eventually, the group slowly dispersed. Michael Wilson, an organizer with the Philly Coalition for REAL Justice, attributed the destruction to crowd anger. “A car burned down there and stuff, you stick around tonight, you might see a whole lot of things burned up, it’s just anger,” Wilson said. “It doesn’t replace the young man saying, ‘I can’t breathe.’ All you’re seeing is a reaction to what the police are doing, that’s all this is, it’s not bad, it’s not good, it’s just a reaction. If the capitalists lose a whole lot tonight or tomorrow, we don’t care, we really don’t care, it’s the price they pay for the way they treat us.” He said the protests will not stop as long as police departments can hire officers who sport Nazi tattoos or are a part of extremist groups. At 5:30, the Philadelphia Police Department tweeted that criminal acts and vandalism would not be tolerated and Mayor Jim Kenney asked protesters to go home. They did not. A crowd remained gathered near City Hall as car fires continued to burn. Businesses in the area were vandalized or broken into. The Starbucks kiosk at Dilworth Park was also set on fire. Police officers sprayed protesters from inside a SWAT van, and were pelted with orange traffic cones and bottles in return. Additional protests are planned in other parts of the state throughout the weekend. In an earlier statement, the governor encouraged people to speak out against the racial injustices happening in the country, but also asked people to stay safe and peaceful. The peaceful protests earlier were touching showings of our collective grief. The anger being displayed now cannot continue. Please have respect and dignity for each other and return home. https://t.co/Xem9btILWk — Jim #StayHomePHL Kenney (@PhillyMayor) May 30, 2020 An early calm A noon protest at City Hall began at Dilworth Plaza with participants socially distanced. They took a knee for nine minutes — a reference to the nine minutes a police officer’s knee allegedly pressed into Floyd’s neck — and observed moments of silence to show support for victims of police violence. Several hundred people gathered, with a small police presence on hand. As the racially mixed crowd grew larger, social distancing diminished. Chants during the peaceful protest included, “We deserve better,” “For our kids,” and “Our lives matter.” Organizers passed out bottled water and masks to crowd members. David Walker came to the event with his daughter and mother, who he said has been protesting since the 1960s. “Someone like George Floyd dies senselessly at the hands of the police,” Walker said, “you can’t just sit around. People have to get out, they have to take action, and most importantly they have to vote in November.” Walker believes the city is trying hard to make improvements to the police department and criminal justice system, but adds policies need to be put into practice. “It’s training, training, training. And then in any group, there’s bad actors. Those bad actors have to be held accountable,” Walker said. The noon event came together largely through social media efforts among concerned citizens. One of the organizers, Josh Yeboah, called on City Council to vote against Kenney’s budget, saying it gives too much money to police at a time when there’s a need for more social services. “It’s your tax dollars being spent. Shouldn’t you get to choose and decide what it pays for?” Yeboah said, reading a prepared statement to members of the media ahead of the noon demonstration.  A little after 1 p.m., protesters began to disperse the area around City Hall and started making their way up JFK Boulevard toward the Philadelphia Museum of Art to attend the second demonstration of the day, set for 2 p.m. 9 minutes of silent kneeling has ended. Protesters have begun chants of “no justice no peace” and “I can’t breath.” pic.twitter.com/IytA1oF1by — Zachariah Hughes (@ZachHughesNews) May 30, 2020 The second event, dubbed “Solidarity Against Police Terrorism,” taking place on the steps of the Philadelphia Museum of Art was organized by Black Lives Matter Philly and Philly for REAL Justice. Its organizers described the Art Museum event as “a solidarity action in support of Minneapolis, and the many other uprisings” that occurred this week in Louisville, Atlanta and other cities across the country protesting police violence against Black individuals. Participants in this event were asked to wear masks to protect themselves and others from the coronavirus, as Philadelphia is still in Gov. Tom Wolf’s “red” phase of the stay-at-home orders. Protesters said they were tired of still having to rally against police violence. Danyca Lok said she has been going to Black Lives Matter protests for years, going back to the 2012 shooting of Trayvon Martin in Florida. She held a sign that said, “My friends shouldn’t fear for their lives when we go out.” “I’ve experienced that countless times … every time me and my friends went out, we always got followed by a cop, or we always had to take a different route somewhere because I have felt like my friends’ lives were in danger.” She said nothing will change unless people keep protesting and speaking out. She is 18 and will be voting for the first time this year. Myia Bonifacino said, “It’s ridiculous that we have to even sit out here and do this, why are we different than everyone else … what, because of the color of our skin?” Her sign read, “I can’t believe I’m still protesting this [expletive.]” “I think everyone’s sick and tired of it … we should be able to just live a normal life, just like everybody else, like there’s absolutely no reason that we have to go out of our way to fight for simple things.” Yalon Dirickson-Martin, who is 55 and came with her daughter, said she hopes more people will listen to what the Black community says. “Unfortunately, some of America don’t believe what we’re saying until they see it on video, but we’re saying the same thing, we’re saying, ‘We need to breathe,’” she said. “I see people of all colors and races and socioeconomic levels all joining together because people, we are just sick and tired of this.” Michael Samuels said he also has been to many Black Lives Matter protests over the years, and will keep going until the police stop taking Black lives. “This ain’t ending till we get what we want,” he said. “This isn’t just a week or a month thing, or two months, three months, we’re going to do this for a year if we have to, 10 years, we’re going to keep pushing.” The Art Museum protest drew a larger crowd than the morning’s City Hall gathering, with less social distancing. It attracted a larger police presence, as well. The mood changes About 3 p.m., the crowd began marching down the Parkway toward City Hall then along North Broad Street. Some businesses and buildings were vandalized with spray paint along the way. No one appeared to be leading the crowd. The crowd stopped at Broad and Vine streets, near the entrance to I-676 — which was blocked by police vehicles. Some protesters were standing on top of the parked police cars, as well as spray-painting them. State police officers in riot gear were on the scene. One of the vandalized parked police cars was set on fire and was burning with large flames. Police set a wide perimeter around the vehicle at Broad and Vine streets. Loud booms were heard by reporters on the scene, what appeared to be the car exploding.

At one point, a protester stood on top of a car and pleaded with people to stop, saying, “We are not here to fight the police, we are not here to hurt anyone.” The Philadelphia police and Pennsylvania state troopers separated the crowd, surrounding them into smaller groups with raised batons and bicycles, and slowly forced people to disperse. In a Twitter thread Saturday morning, Mayor Kenney commented on the recent murders of Black Americans — including George Floyd, and Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia. “You should not have to bear witness to the killing of yet another unarmed Black person,” Kenney wrote. “You should not have to feel as though society believes your lives are less valuable than white Americans. And you should not fear for your lives — or for your loved ones — when leaving the house.” In the midst of a global pandemic, America’s original sin of racism has not gone dormant. It has claimed the lives of Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, and George Floyd. — Jim #StayHomePHL Kenney (@PhillyMayor) May 30, 2020 The mayor added that he understands the “need to stand up and make your voices heard,” but pleaded with participants to protest peacefully, social distance as much as possible, and wear masks. Large protests over Floyd’s death — as well as police brutality and racial violence in America — started Tuesday in Minneapolis and have grown to cities nationwide. Almost all protesters were wearing masks, some even brought boxes of masks to pass out to people who wanted one. Floyd, 46, died in law enforcement custody on Monday after police arrested him based on a report of a counterfeit bill being passed at a Minneapolis convenience store. A video of his arrest, taken by a witness, shows Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin pinning Floyd to the ground with his knee on Floyd’s neck. In the video, Floyd pleads with the officers that he can’t breathe. Chauvin was arrested on Friday and charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Protests have been held in Minneapolis daily, and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz fully mobilized the National Guard on Saturday, saying the unrest is “no longer, in any way, about the murder of George Floyd.” Protest hits Wilmington In Wilmington, protesters shut down a section of I-95. After demonstrators spoke with Delaware State Police, many moved off the highway by mid-afternoon. Earlier in the day protesters broke windows on Market Street between Sixth and Seventh streets. A Starbucks at Seventh and Market had all its windows smashed out. The Starbucks has been closed since the end of March because of the coronavirus. The location is the former site of the Wilmington campus of Delaware State University. Across the street, wait staff from the restaurant Bardea took brooms to break the shattered glass. The restaurant had just reopened after almost two months due to coronavirus precautions. It had just restarted sidewalk dining A beauty supply store next to WHYY’s Wilmington newsroom had its window shattered as well. The Associated Press contributed reporting.",0.0
1621118162,2020-05-30 15:52:34,SpaceX rocket ship blasts off into orbit with 2 Americans,https://whyy.org/articles/spacex-rocket-ship-blasts-off-into-orbit-with-2-americans/,en,False,,82303,whyy.org,http://whyy.org/#spider,"A rocket ship built by Elon Musk’s SpaceX company thundered away from Earth with two Americans on Saturday, ushering in a new era of commercial space travel and putting NASA back in the business of launching astronauts from U.S. soil for the first time in nearly a decade. NASA’s Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken rode skyward aboard a sleek, white-and-black, bullet-shaped Dragon capsule on top of a Falcon 9 rocket, lifting off at 3:22 p.m. from the same launch pad used to send the Apollo astronauts to the moon a half-century ago. Minutes later, they safely entered orbit. “Let’s light this candle,” Hurley said just before ignition, borrowing the words used by Alan Shepard on America’s first human spaceflight, in 1961. The two men are scheduled to arrive at the International Space Station on Sunday for a stay of up to four months, after which they will return to Earth in a Right Stuff-style splashdown at sea. The mission unfolded amid the gloom of the coronavirus outbreak, which has killed over 100,000 Americans, and racial unrest across the U.S. over the death of George Floyd, a handcuffed black man, at the hands of Minneapolis police. NASA officials and others held out hope the flight would would be a morale-booster. “Maybe there’s an opportunity here for America to maybe pause and look up and see a bright, shining moment of hope at what the future looks like, that the United States of America can do extraordinary things even in difficult times,” NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine said before launch. With the on-time liftoff, SpaceX, founded by Musk, the Tesla electric-car visionary, became the first private company to launch people into orbit, a feat achieved previously by only three governments: the U.S., Russia and China. The flight also ended a nine-year launch drought for NASA, the longest such hiatus in its history. Ever since it retired the space shuttle in 2011, NASA has relied on Russian spaceships launched from Kazakhstan to take U.S. astronauts to and from the space station. In the intervening years, NASA outsourced the job of designing and building its next generation of spaceships to SpaceX and Boeing, awarding them $7 billion in contracts in a public-private partnership aimed at driving down costs and spurring innovation. Boeing’s spaceship, the Starliner capsule, is not expected to fly astronauts until early 2021. Musk said earlier in the week that the project is aimed at “reigniting the dream of space and getting people fired up about the future.” Ultimately, NASA hopes to rely in part on its commercial partners as it works to send astronauts back to the moon in the next few years, and on to Mars in the 2030s. Before setting out for the launch pad in a gull-wing Tesla SUV — another Musk product — Behnken pantomimed a hug of his 6-year-old son, Theo, and said: “Are you going to listen to Mommy and make her life easy?” Hurley blew kisses to his 10-year-old son and wife. A launch attempt on Wednesday was called off with less than 17 minutes to go in the countdown because of lightning. On Saturday, stormy weather in Florida threatened another postponement for most of the day, but then the skies began to clear in the afternoonjust in time. Nine minutes after liftoff, the rocket’s first stage booster landed, as designed, on a barge a few hundred miles off the Florida coast. Inside Kennedy Space Center, attendance was strictly limited because of the coronavirus, and the small crowd of a few thousand was a shadow of what it would have been without the threat of COVID-19. President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence flew in for the event for the second time in four days. By NASA’s count, over 3 million viewers tuned in online. Despite NASA’s insistence that the public stay safe by staying home, spectators gathered along beaches and roads hours in advance. Among them was Neil Wight, a machinist from Buffalo, New York, who staked out a view of the launch pad from a park in Titusville. “It’s pretty historically significant in my book, and a lot of other people’s books. With everything that’s going on in this country right now, it’s important that we do things extraordinary in life,” Wight said. “We’ve been bombarded with doom and gloom for the last six, eight weeks, whatever it is, and this is awesome. It brings a lot of people together.” The astronauts were kept in quasi-quarantine for more than two months before liftoff. The SpaceX technicians who helped them get into their spacesuits wore masks and gloves that made them look like black-clad ninjas. And at the launch center, the SpaceX controllers were seated far apart. Hurley, a 53-year-old retired Marine, and Behnken, 49, an Air Force colonel, are veterans of two space shuttle flights each. Hurley piloted the space shuttle on the last launch of astronauts from Kennedy, on July 8, 2011. In keeping with Musk’s penchant for futuristic flash, the astronauts wore angular white uniforms with black trim. Instead of the usual multitude of dials, knobs and switches, the Dragon capsule has three large touchscreens. SpaceX has been launching cargo capsules to the space station since 2012. In preparation for Wednesday’s flight, SpaceX sent up a Dragon capsule with only a test dummy aboard last year, and it docked smoothly at the orbiting outpost on autopilot, then returned to Earth in a splashdown. During the Mercury, Gemini, Apollo and shuttle programs, NASA relied on aerospace contractors to build spacecraft according to the agency’s designs. NASA owned and operated the ships. Under the new, 21st-century partnership, aerospace companies design, build, own and operate the spaceships, and NASA is essentially a paying customer on a list that could eventually include non-government researchers, artists and tourists. (Tom Cruise has already expressed interest.) “What Elon Musk has done for the American space program is he has brought vision and inspiration that we hadn’t had” since the shuttle’s retirement in 2011, Bridenstine said on the eve of launch. He called the SpaceX chief “brilliant” and said Musk has “absolutely delivered” for NASA. The mission is technically considered by SpaceX and NASA to be a test flight. The next SpaceX voyage to the space station, set for the end of August, will have a full, four-person crew: three Americans and one Japanese. Wednesday’s first human flight was originally targeted for around 2015. But NASA’s commercial crew program encountered bureaucratic delays and technical setbacks. A SpaceX capsule exploded on the test stand last year. Boeing’s first Starliner capsule ended up in the wrong orbit during an crew-less test flight in December and was nearly destroyed at the mission’s end. Both companies had trouble with such things as the landing parachutes.",0.0

A protest in Wilmington remained peaceful Saturday morning. A group demonstrated and made statements with a bullhorn at Rodney Square in downtown. “I express my sincere condolences to the family of Mr. Floyd,” Bishop Malooly said. “I pray for the repose of Mr. Floyd’s soul, and that God will send comfort and consolation to his family. “While I support those who seek justice through peaceful demonstrations, we must keep in mind what Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. taught us about non-violence,” the bishop said. “It is easy to lash out in anger when confronted by injustice, but the easy thing to do often is not the right thing to do. “Please join me this Pentecost weekend in prayer that the Holy Spirit will guide us to lasting, peaceful solutions to the problems we face as a society. Racism, brutality, murder, violence, bigotry, and disenfranchisement are not Gospel values and must be condemned in the strongest terms. Let us proceed as brothers and sisters, beloved children of God.” Protests in Minneapolis have turned to violent demonstrations and lasted several days, prompting Gov. Tim Walz to bring in the National Guard May 29. The protests sparked similar rioting in at least a dozen U.S. cities, including Los Angeles, Atlanta, Phoenix, Denver, New York, Louisville, and Columbus, Ohio. Floyd, 46, was arrested by police on suspicion of forgery. Once he was handcuffed, a white officer pinned him down on the street, putting his knee on Floyd’s neck for eight minutes. A now widely circulated video shows Floyd repeatedly saying, “I can’t breathe.” He appears to lose consciousness or die and was later declared dead at the hospital. The next day, hundreds of people protested at the intersection where police officers subdued Floyd, demanding justice for him and the arrest of the four officers involved. The officers were fired May 26 and as of midday May 29, local prosecutors filed criminal charges against at least one of the now former officers: The one seen putting his knee on Floyd’s neck, identified as Derek Chauvin, was arrested and charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter.

(Photo: Jerry Habraken, Delaware News Journal) The march, which was organized by Food Not Bombs Wilmington and the city's Black Lives Matter movement, was one of dozens across the country this week protesting Floyd's death. Though the four Minneapolis officers involved were fired almost immediately after video of Floyd's death surfaced on social media and prosecutors charged Officer Derek Chauvin, the man who knelt on Floyd's neck, with manslaughter and third degree murder, protestors say it's not enough — that more has to be done for Floyd. NATIONWIDE PROTESTS: George Floyd protests continue nationwide as hundreds arrested, cities begin issuing curfews In the days since the man's death, many rallies across the nation have turned violent, with protesters looting stores and setting cars ablaze. In nearby Philadelphia, hundreds of protesters gathered at City Hall and knelt in silence before marching to the Museum of Art, where other protesters had gathered. At at least one police vehicle caught on fire. But Wilmington's protest, which drew more than 1,000 people at its height, remained mostly peaceful Saturday afternoon — something organizers and attendees said they had hoped for. FLOYD PROTESTS: 'There are anarchists': Minnesota officials say 'outside agitators' are hijacking peaceful protests It also drew people of all ages, genders and color, proof that ""this is not just a black thing anymore,"" said 21-year-old Jazmine Church, who marched with friends and family. ""This has been going on for years — it's not like this is new,"" Church said. ""I've been around to see these senseless killings happen, so it's good to see everybody participating, everyone upset. It's time for them to stop."" For decades, communities of color have demanded an end to the racism they say they experience on a day-to-day basis. Time and time again, they've said they are tired of their men and women being targeted or killed by police, and are fed up with using social media hashtags to remember victims such as Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown, Eric Garner and Breonna Taylor. Floyd's death, the most recent incident in a week of already-increased racial tensions, brought those frustrations to a head, which was made evident Saturday as Wilmington protesters confronted police at various points during their march. Outside Wilmington Police headquarters, one woman destroyed the department's wooden sign, and another protester smashed the windshield of a patrol car. Some shouted ""f--- the police,"" and others yelled in officers' faces. But the officers took it in stride, telling protesters that they, too, were outraged by Floyd's death. MORE PROTESTS: George Floyd protest updates: Minnesota officials blame outside agitators for violence, volunteers help as grocery stores close ""That incident that happened out in Minneapolis, goddamnit, that set us back 20 or 30 years,"" Wilmington Police Chief Robert Tracy said. ""It opened up a lot of wounds and rightfully so, and you know what? We got to let people express that anger. ""But we got to make sure they do it peacefully. We can't be having people throw rocks at buildings, and that's what I'm trying to prevent."" Though protesters grew more rowdy as the day wore on, they remained largely peaceful during afternoon hours, even when confronting Delaware State Police on I-95. Troopers had set up a fleet of patrol vehicles to block off the highway north of the Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard on-ramp. Buy Photo Protesters shut down traffic on I-95 and various intersections around downtown Wilmington in response to the death of George Floyd Saturday, May 30, 2020. (Photo: Jerry Habraken, Delaware News Journal) The troopers held long guns, which protesters decried as unnecessary. Why were they armed, when the protesters were not?, many said. ""Am I supposed to be afraid of you?"" one woman yelled. The crowd stirred, breaking into chants at times and airing grievances to the troopers at others. Then, in a moment of truce, the confrontation was over. The troopers agreed to store their weapons in the patrol cars. The crowd broke out into applause. Almost in unison, they turned and marched off the highway, back into the city's downtown. As the crowd dispersed from the interstate, Kiyoko Barbour sat along the curb with a friend. She said she attended the demonstration because she fears her son, as a young black person, lives in danger from others in the city and the police. While George Floyd’s death sparked Saturday’s action, such situations happen across the country, she said, and have been replayed for generations. “It’s terrible to raise black kids in America because you’re scared every day,” Barbour said as she began to weep. Wilmington resident Bertrand Morales echoed Barbour. Walking just behind the crowd that had moved from the highway and was heading to Market Street, he looked around. As he took in the scene — his first protest — he commiserated with his fellow ralliers. ""A lot of people are fed up, and this is what it's come to,"" Morales said. ""These (killings) should have ended a long time ago. It's time to change."" Reporters Jeanne Kuang and Karl Baker contributed to this report.

1621189615,2020-05-30 18:00:14,US cities fear protests may fuel new wave of virus outbreaks,https://whyy.org/articles/us-cities-fear-protests-may-fuel-new-wave-of-virus-outbreaks/,en,False,,82303,whyy.org,http://whyy.org/#spider,"The massive protests sweeping across U.S. cities following the police killing of a black man in Minnesota have sent shudders through the health community and elevated fears that the huge crowds will lead to a new surge in cases of the coronavirus. Some leaders appealing for calm in places where crowds smashed storefronts and destroyed police cars in recent nights have been handing out masks and warning demonstrators they were putting themselves at risk. Minnesota’s governor said Saturday that too many protesters weren’t socially distancing or wearing masks after heeding the call earlier in the week. But many seemed undeterred. “It’s not OK that in the middle of a pandemic we have to be out here risking our lives,” Spence Ingram said Friday after marching with other protesters to the state Capitol in Atlanta. “But I have to protest for my life and fight for my life all the time.” Ingram, 25, who was wearing a mask, said she has asthma and was worried about contracting the virus. But she said as a black woman, she always felt that her life was under threat from police and she needed to protest that. The demonstrations over the killing of George Floyd, a black man who died after a white Minneapolis officer pressed a knee into his neck, are coming at a time when many cities were beginning to relax stay-at-home orders. That’s especially worrisome for health experts who fear that silent carriers of the virus who have no symptoms could unwittingly infect others at gatherings with people packed cheek to jowl and cheering and jeering without masks. “Whether they’re fired up or not that doesn’t prevent them from getting the virus,” said Bradley Pollock, chairman of the Department of Public Health Sciences at the University of California, Davis. Even for the many protesters who have been wearing masks, those don’t guarantee protection from the coronavirus. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends cloth masks because they can make it more difficult for infected people to spread the virus — but they are not designed to protect the person wearing the mask from getting it. The U.S. has been worst hit by the coronavirus outbreak, with more than 1.7 million cases and over 103,000 deaths, according to a tally kept by Johns Hopkins University. In New York City, where more than 21,000 people have died during the pandemic, a large crowd in Brooklyn tossed water bottles at officers and torched a police van Friday outside the Barclays Center. Officers cleared the crowd by spraying an eye-irritating chemical. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said after another night of unrest in Minneapolis that many protesters wearing masks were simply trying to hide their identities and “cause confusion and take advantage of this situation.” “I will continue to stress, because it seems like a lifetime ago: We are still in the middle of a pandemic and passed 1,000 deaths yesterday. We still have hospitals on the verge of being overrun with COVID-19,” he said. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey echoed those concerns: “We have two crises that are sandwiched on top of one other.” The state’s health commissioner had warned just days earlier that the massive protests were almost certain to fuel new cases of the virus. Minnesota reported 35 deaths on Thursday, a single-day high since the start of the outbreak, and 29 more on Friday. But it wasn’t just protesters at risk — unmasked officers stood within arm’s reach of shouting demonstrators. In Atlanta, police Chief Erika Shields waded into a crowd without a mask Friday while she listened to people air frustrations. When Los Angeles officials announced earlier in the week that the city was relaxing stay-at-home orders and reopening stores, they said political protests could resume but with a cap of 100 people. Several hundred people showed up for a protest organized by Black Lives Matter-LA and later shut down a freeway. Most wore masks, but many did not observe a buffer zone. Los Angeles County Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer said Friday that was an ongoing concern. “Show respect for each other by putting on that face covering so that your respiratory droplets aren’t unintentionally getting into somebody else’s mouth, nose or eyes,” she said. Those same concerns surfaced Saturday in Paris when unions flaunted a ban on large gatherings at a march to protest conditions against undocumented workers and migrants. Police used tear gas to disperse the crowds and said they had banned the march due to the “health risks that such an event is likely to generate.” Meanwhile, the European Union on Saturday urged President Donald Trump to rethink his decision to terminate the U.S. relationship with the World Health Organization as spiking infection rates in India and elsewhere reinforced that the pandemic is far from contained. Trump on Friday charged that the WHO didn’t respond adequately to the pandemic and accused the U.N. agency of being under China’s “total control.” The U.S. is the largest source of financial support for the WHO, and its exit is expected to significantly weaken the organization. The head of the EU’s executive arm urged Trump to reconsider. “The WHO needs to continue being able to lead the international response to pandemics, current and future,” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said. German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas told Germany’s Funke media group that Trump’s decision was the “wrong signal at the wrong time.” In China, where the virus outbreak began, only four new confirmed cases were reported Saturday, all brought from outside the country. More than 6 million coronavirus infections have been reported worldwide, with over 367,000 deaths and more than 2.5 million recoveries, according to the Johns Hopkins tally. The true death toll is widely believed to be significantly higher, with experts saying many victims died of the virus without ever being tested for it. Elite sporting events will be allowed to resume in England starting Monday, but without spectators, paving the way for the planned June 17 return of the Premier League, the world’s richest soccer competition. England’s deputy chief medical officer Jonathan Van-Tam warned that the situation overall remained precarious. “I believe this is also a very dangerous moment,” he said. “We have to get this right.” India registered another record single-day jump of 7,964 cases and 265 deaths. The government had been expected to end a 2-month-old nationwide lockdown but instead extended measures in some areas due to coronavirus outbreaks. Italy, though, added 111 new victims to its death toll and nearly 420 new infections, in line with its recent daily tallies, suggesting the virus is under control nearly four weeks after the country began gingerly loosening a strict lockdown in the onetime European epicenter of the pandemic.",0.0
1621189611,2020-05-30 18:59:39,Minnesota to deploy record National Guard force to contain unrest over death of George Floyd,https://whyy.org/npr_story_post/minnesota-to-deploy-record-guard-force-to-contain-unrest-over-death-of-george-floyd/,en,False,,82303,whyy.org,http://whyy.org/#spider,"Updated at 4:41 p.m. ET Faced with a fourth straight night of massive protests over the death of George Floyd, Minnesota on Friday deployed its largest law enforcement operation in state history, including more than 700 members of the National Guard. “It was not enough,” Maj. Gen. Jon A. Jensen said Saturday. Now, with a fifth night of protests looming, Jensen, head of the state’s National Guard, said authorities are drastically increasing the military presence in Minneapolis. Officials expected to deploy some 2,500 soldiers and airmen by midday Saturday and will soon mobilize the state’s full National Guard force of more than 13,000 — “an action that has never been taken in 164-year history of the Minnesota National Guard,” according to Gov. Tim Walz, who spoke at a joint news conference with Jensen. “We understand the work that we need to do and the generational pain that went into what happened with George Floyd and that murder,” the governor said Saturday. “But at this point in time, nothing we do to address those inequities, nothing we do to provide justice to George Floyd and his family that I spoke with last evening — none of those things matter to any of these people who are out there firing upon National Guard, burning businesses of our communities and making intent on disrupting any semblance of civil life.” The Pentagon has also placed as many as 800 members of the military police on prepare-to-deploy orders, a U.S. official confirmed to NPR. The officers would be available to assist with logistics, analysis or surveillance if requested by the governor. More than 1,000 additional Citizen-Soldiers and Airmen are activating today. This is in addition to the 700 that were on duty as of late last night. This represents the largest domestic deployment in the Minnesota’s National Guard’s 164-year history. pic.twitter.com/aV9NOFv5uo — MN National Guard (@MNNationalGuard) May 30, 2020 Less than a week has passed since Floyd’s death in police custody. The disturbing video of his arrest, filmed by a bystander Monday evening in Minneapolis, shows Officer Derek Chauvin with his knee on the neck of the handcuffed black man for more than seven minutes. The white police officer — who has since been fired and charged with murder — continues to plant his weight on Floyd well after his pleas for help give way to an unresponsive silence. A federal investigation remains underway into the incident, with more charges possible for Chauvin and the three other officers seen in the video. That has not satisfied protesters, whose furor over Floyd’s death has spread well beyond Minneapolis. A slew of cities — from Detroit to Atlanta, from Los Angeles to Washington, D.C. — have seen protesters gather to voice their outrage about police treatment of African Americans. In many of those cities, gatherings turned violent, with some protesters clashing with police and damaging buildings. Law enforcement reported hundreds of arrests across the country and at least one death — a 19-year-old man who was killed when someone fired into a crowd in Detroit, according to local police. Several people were also injured by gunfire Thursday night in Louisville, Ky., where crowds have gathered to protest a grievance closer to home: the death of Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old black woman who was shot and killed by police in her own apartment earlier this year. There were no incidents of gun violence linked to the protests Friday night in Louisville, but NPR member station WFPL reports that clashes erupted between protesters and police. Protesters shattered windows at the courthouse, and police fired tear gas to disperse the crowds, according to WFPL. On Saturday, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear announced that he, too, was calling up the National Guard, in order “to help keep peace in Louisville.” “I hope everybody knows this is a big step and a tough step, and it’s not one intended to silence any voice, because I want to hear,” Beshear said in a statement explaining the move. “But I want to make sure at the end of the day that we are all safe.” President Trump weighed in on the protests Saturday. He said the best way to honor Floyd’s memory is for authorities to “get tougher” on the protesters who resort to violence, whom he called “radical left, bad people [who] have got to be taught that you can’t do this.” “They’ve got to be tough, they’ve got to be smart,” Trump said of state officials. “We have our military ready, willing and able if they ever want to call on our military. But we could have troops on the ground very quickly if they ever want our military.” In a statement Saturday, Attorney General William Barr echoed Trump’s comments, saying that though the outrage is “real and legitimate,” the protests are “being hijacked by violent radical elements.” “Groups of outside radicals and agitators are exploiting the situation to pursue their own separate and violent agenda,” Barr said. “In many places, it appears the violence is planned, organized, and driven by anarchistic and far left extremists, using Antifa-like tactics, many of whom travel from out of state to promote the violence.” NPR’s Tom Bowman contributed to this report.",0.0

They shouted. They cried. They briefly shut down I-95. They demanded justice for the 46-year-old, all while traveling more than 6 miles through the city. But as day gave way to night, protesters began smashing the windows of Market Street businesses. Broken glass littered sidewalks as police in riot gear started cordoning off downtown streets. Keep up with Wilmington news: Subscribe to Delaware Online for access to stories about life in Delaware's largest city. Around 10 p.m., police ordered people off downtown streets. First it was Market, then Shipley. With chants of ""I can't breathe"" reverberating through the city's downtown, protesters grew increasingly angry and more destructive as the evening hours wore on, targeting car windows and briefly setting fire to trash that littered the streets. THE DAY'S PROTESTS: 'Not just a black thing anymore:' Wilmington protesters demand justice for George Floyd The evening looting, which drew criticism from Gov. John Carney — he said he shared protesters' anger over Floyd's death but condemned the ""random acts of vandalism against small businesses and this violence in our city"" — was a continuation of the day's rally to demand justice for Floyd. The protest began at Rodney Square at 11 a.m. with several hundred people, but quickly drew a crowd of more than 1,000. By 2:30 p.m., the couple hundred people remaining shut down I-95, nearly clashing with Delaware State Police. Ultimately, the crowd left when troopers put away their long guns. After leaving the interstate, the remaining group marched to Wilmington Police's downtown headquarters, where earlier in the day crowds had turned their anger over police abuse toward a line of officers standing outside the station. Wilmington Mayor Mike Purzycki and Police Chief Robert Tracy spoke to the group in the evening, which temporarily calmed the protesters. Buy Photo Looters break into businesses on and near Market Street in downtown Wilmington as protests against police violence grew into rioting Saturday. (Photo: WILLIAM BRETZGER, The News Journal) Protesters asked the two if they would request a resignation from any officer who said they were OK with what happened to Floyd. Both Tracy and Purzycki said yes, according to several protesters. When asked about the comments later, Tracy clarified. “My answer was yes,” he said. “Because no officer is OK with what happened in Minneapolis. The law enforcement community is stunned that someone would do that.” A group of Wilmington police officers holding riot shields and batons then formed two rows along Market Street, briefly blocking the road between 8th and 9th Street. Some protesters complained the action would only inflame the situation. Shortly after, the rows of police marched away, but later returned with armored vehicles. Dion Wilson, a frequent critic of the city’s leadership, said he believed the multiracial nature of the Wilmington crowd, and similar protests nationally, kept police from responding more aggressively. It’s a sign of improvement over the past, he said. “I was here in the '60s,"" Wilson said. “They used real bullets.” As protesters marched up Market Street, though, some demonstrators began smashing the windows of the Bardea restaurant and Starbucks – two businesses that many of Wilmington’s leadership have pointed to in recent years as signs of the city’s revitalization. Buy Photo A police vehicle at Tenth and Market Streets is vandalized as looters break into businesses on and near Market Street in downtown Wilmington as protests against police violence grew into rioting Saturday. (Photo: WILLIAM BRETZGER, The News Journal) Some protesters took aim at the long-simmering inequality in Wilmington represented by the recently revitalized Market Street. As they surveyed the damage at Bardea, one of the first to be vandalized, some recalled the beloved — and cheaper — fried chicken eatery it had replaced. Still, protesters ultimately targeted businesses of all stripes throughout downtown, from upscale bars and restaurants to pawn shops and takeout joints. That, in turn, drew anger from other demonstrators, who decried the vandalism. NATIONWIDE PROTESTS: George Floyd protests continue nationwide as hundreds are arrested, cities issue curfews Drew Forrester, 24, from Wilmington, said he tried to keep peace with police by urging protesters to move along the street away from the damaged businesses. “We can’t act immature. We can’t afford it,” he said. “Let’s do it the right way.” He asked some of demonstrators, “What did Starbucks do to you?"" “We can’t afford it,” one protester replied. Buy Photo Wilmington Police stand guard inside a store that was broken into on Saturday during protests for the death of George Floyd.

Arguing ensued between those who opposed the break-ins and those who did not. As the sun set over Wilmington, police officers on Market Street carried sticks and shields while protesters screamed ""F*ck the police."" As demonstrators smashed the windows of a BoostMobile on Market Street, a police officer was heard saying ""Sargent, get out your stick."" FLOYD PROTESTS: 'There are anarchists': Minnesota officials say 'outside agitators' are hijacking peaceful protests By 7 p.m., the protesters had moved through Trolley Square, arriving down Delaware Avenue and turning onto North DuPont Street toward Pennsylvania Avenue near Brew HaHa and Acme. Near that intersection, one man hopped on top of a moving car as it drove down the street. One woman carried a small child, with other children also in the crowd. Several cars were smashed in, enraging some of the residents who watched from their doorsteps. One of those cars belonged to Amber Bonsall, who said she was visiting her friend in Trolley Square on Saturday evening when her Toyota Corolla’s window was shattered by one of the passing protesters. She said she had just come out of the shower when she heard “a lot of yelling” and went out to see the crowd. “I didn’t expect it to come to what it came to,” she said. She added that she saw some protesters emptying water bottles and throwing them on cars, but she didn’t see what broke her window. “We didn’t do anything to provoke it at all,” she said, adding that her hands were shaking. “It’s hard for me at this moment to look past that.” Many residents walked outside their home and watched as the crowd marched away. “I seriously don’t understand why they’re coming through the streets of Wilmington like this,” said a white woman standing next to Bonsall. “It’s not going to solve any problem. Why destroy personal property? What does that do?” “It’s just ridiculous,” she said. “Where’s (the) humanity?” Communities of color say they have been asking that same question for years, and are fed up with the lack of change after every police killing. Bertrand Morales, a 51-year-old Wilmington resident who marched earlier in the day, said prior to the Saturday rally, he'd never attended a protest before. After Floyd's killing on Monday, though, he said ""it just hit home."" ""Some days I live in fear, and I have to pull myself out of bed to go out every day because I don't know if it will happen to me,"" said Morales, who is black. ""I just really want for it to stop — I just want some equality, some fairness."" That message was echoed by other protesters on Saturday, though in a more violent way as darkness fell on Wilmington. Buy Photo Display racks are left blocking Orange Street as looters break into businesses on and near Market Street in downtown Wilmington as protests against police violence grew into rioting Saturday. (Photo: WILLIAM BRETZGER, The News Journal) Around 8:30 p.m., protesters broke into La Fia and Merchant Bar and stole their liquor. A reporter for WDEL was also punched in the left eye by protesters. Tracy, Wilmington's police chief, was on Market Street overseeing the protest as armored vehicles stationed near downtown. By 9:30 p.m., one tactical vehicle rolled down Market Street, telling protesters to clear the road as their rally was now an ""unlawful assembly."" Solid Gold Jewelers on Ninth Street appeared to be a total loss, with its display case strewn along the sidewalk outside the storefront. A convenience store half a block away on Ninth and Orange streets suffered a similar fate, as did the Mecca Body Oils, Incense Beans and Variety Store, next door. When asked, one man said he was taking part in the ransacking of businesses on Orange Street because peaceful protests don’t change things. As it stands now, the country isn’t made for black people, he said. “Who is Independence Day for?"" he asked. “It’s for people with liberty. We ain’t got that.” As he spoke, a once-raging dumpster fire on Orange Street died down to just a few small flames. Dozens of people watched. Some continued chants of “black lives matter,” heard earlier in the day. Some held products that appeared to be taken from nearby shops. Watching the scene play out was Shannon Pressey, a Newark man who had been at the protests since people first gathered at Rodney Square at 11 a.m. He called the destruction around him “wrong,” and said many carrying it out might be opportunists. But “they have reason to be upset."" By 10 p.m., Wilmington police began their process of clearing streets. A police officer wearing a gas mask at 9th and Shipley streets prohibited demonstrators from walking to Market Street where police in riot gear had been gathering next to an armored vehicle. Minutes later, a police officer farther south along Shipley spoke through a loud speaker. “This is an unlawful assembly. You must leave now. Get off the street,” he said. “If you are on the street, you will submit to arrest.” Wilmington officials have not commented on the looting, but issued a statement earlier in the day saying they were ""outraged"" by Floyd's death. ""We also take this opportunity to mourn the loss of other people of color who have died needlessly in recent months and years through a troubling history of racial divide in our country,"" the city said. Just before 10:30 p.m., the American Civil Liberties Union of Delaware echoed Wilmington in a statement, saying the ""extreme measures"" that protesters took throughout the night come from ""the deep-rooted pain from centuries of oppression and systemic racism"" in the country. ""We don’t have to agree with what’s happening in the city tonight, but we must understand why it’s happening in order to move forward,"" said Mike Brickner, executive director of ACLU of Delaware. ""Police violence and murder by police are all too common in Black and Brown communities, and Delaware is no exception."" Neither Wilmington nor state officials have indicated they plan to implement curfews that many large cities have seen in the wake of violent protests, including in nearby Philadelphia. But Carney said earlier in the night that the violence was ""unacceptable and counterproductive."" ""It’s an insult to the cause and it needs to stop,"" he said. ""In the days and months ahead, we all need to commit ourselves to healing the racial discord and addressing the systemic inequality that gives rise to it. ""But we need to do so peacefully and in good faith."" Faith leaders also weighed in, including Rev. Christopher Bullock, a pastor at Caanan Baptist Church. He called for a statewide coalition of Delaware faith leaders to pray and denounce the violence spreading in Wilmington and throughout the nation arising from Floyd’s killing. “Our nation is painfully in despair,” Bullock said in a statement late Saturday. “Over 100,000 Americans have perished due to COVID-19. Another 41 million are unemployed. Our nation is restless about the unfortunate death of George Floyd and others, at the hands of police. Peaceful protest and demonstrations have their place, but the ugliness of looting, anarchy and lawlessness is never acceptable.” Reporters Esteban Parra and Karl Baker contributed to this story.

Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw said 13 police officers were injured in protests over the death of George Floyd that resulted in property damage and several burned cars. Outlaw reportedly also said civilians suffered injuries as well. A citywide curfew was in effect from 8 p.m. Saturday through 6 a.m. Sunday. Police began enforcing the curfew and pushing lines of protesters away from Center City at about 9 p.m. Dressed in riot gear, they marched south down 15th street and used batons and shields to force protesters to retreat.

At least four cars were burned, and the statue of former controversial police commissioner and mayor Frank Rizzo was defaced. Protesters also broke windows at City Hall and damaged dozens of business near Chestnut Street, including a Foot Locker and Walgreens. A Starbucks outside City Hall was also set on fire. Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf Saturday night signed a disaster emergency declaration to provide all necessary assistance to municipalities as they respond to the escalation of protests in Harrisburg, Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. “People have every right to speak out and demonstrate, but it’s unacceptable to take advantage of protests to incite violence, harm others and destroy property,” Gov. Wolf said. CLOSE Protests began peacefully but took a turn at night as crowds dispersed into Center City Philadelphia. This video contains explicit language. Delaware News Journal The declaration authorizes the Pennsylvania National Guard and the Pennsylvania State Police commissioner to activate personnel and use resources ""as necessary to alleviate the danger to public health and safety caused by this emergency."" Philadelphia police said late Saturday night that an officer was “attempting to stop individuals in a vehicle who were involved in looting a business in the area of 7th and Chestnut” and was run over by the vehicle. The officer was taken to Jefferson Hospital and sustained a broken arm and other injuries. A burned police car sat out front of an Apple store on Walnut street between 16th and 17th, where many businesses were damaged. The Philadelphia Fire Department later responded to a three-alarm fire at 1700 Walnut, just northeast of Rittenhouse Park.

The city instituted a curfew as crowds protested against police violence after the death of Minnesota man George Floyd. (Photo: Jenna Miller/Delaware News Journal) At 10:30 p.m., armored police vehicles used what appeared to be tear gas to disperse light crowds on Broad Street and more arrests were made. 'This is necessary' Two Philadelphia protests morphed into one early Saturday afternoon as thousands of marchers moved from a City Hall demonstration to a larger, Black Lives Matter-sanctioned gathering at the Philadelphia Art Museum. People, an overwhelming majority in masks, were met with a strong police presence as they gathered just after noon, with many more people still arriving as the day went on. Earlier in the day, there were chants of ""We will remain,'' with responses of ""Peaceful!'' from the gatherers. These were followed by chants of, ""No justice!'' ""No peace!'' Kevin Sellers of West Philadelphia's Cobbs Creek neighborhood, described racial climate in this country as being ""at a boiling point and the pot has boiled over.'' ""We are tired of the rhetoric and thoughts and prayers,"" said Sellers, who is black. ""Too many people, black men and women, have been killed at the hands of police and Eric Garner and George Floyd was caught on tape and still they take days and days and days to investigate and our patience has boiled over.'' In South Jersey: Camden residents, elected officials march against police brutality In New York City: NYC protest live stream: Protests over George Floyd's death continue Saturday After a morning of peaceful protesting, a state police vehicle was reportedly set on fire near Broad and Vine streets and protesters stopped drivers on I-95. “This is necessary,” said Natasha Goskowsky, an Atlantic City, NJ native who came to Philadelphia to protest. She was taking pictures with her phone at 8:40 p.m., as she stood near the corner of Chestnut and 15 streets, where a trash can was on fire, the windows of a Wells Fargo busted and debris lay strewn west down the block. “This is what they have to do to be heard. I stand with them.” Ebony Franklin of Nicetown, who is black, and two friends were on hand passing out free water to rally attendees at the museum. ""It is really hot and we wanted to be supportive,'' she said. ""Everyone is tired and frustrated. This is something small that we can do. People have been coming to us and refilling our coolers all day.'' Nehemiah Whittley of Philadelphia is a performance artist who was lying flat on his back on the marble in front of the art museum. He said he wants people to remember that change can come through art. ""I want people to see a reflection in me and in the marble of change,'' he added. Beth Wright of Langhorne, Pennsylvania, brought her son, Daniel, who is 8. The white mother said she wanted to bring her son ""to teach him what to do when he sees something wrong, and this was wrong."" ""It's unjust,"" she said, fighting tears behind her mask. ""I want him to know that, and I want him to grow up in a better world."" She said her son's safety was her first priority, but the organizers, including Black Lives Matter, seemed to be intent on peaceful protests, which made her feel better about bringing her son on Saturday. Police, too, she said, ""seem friendly and not adversarial,"" adding to her sense of security. Protestors gather outside City Hall in Philadelphia on Saturday evening to protest against police violence after the death of Minnesota man George Floyd.

""This is murder,"" read the shirts, which Jones was selling for $15. Phaedra Trethan has been a reporter and editor in South Jersey since 2007 and has covered Camden since 2015.

Police cars and government buildings burned, the National Guard was deployed, and some of the country's largest cities instituted curfews. In one Midwest city, a person was killed and at least two more shot. More than 1,400 people have been arrested in 16 cities since Thursday, with more than 500 of those happening in Los Angeles on Friday, the Associated Press reported. Former officer Derek Chauvin faces the charges in Floyd's death, but activist groups say they are inadequate. Video from a bystander showed Chauvin pressing his knee on Floyd's neck for more than eight minutes. The demonstrations Saturday were part of a National Day of Protest against Chauvin and police brutality inflicted nationwide. Protesters also called out the names of other people of color killed by police, including Louisville's Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old ER tech who was shot and killed by police in March. Here is a city-by-city look at what's happening across the country. Indianapolis: One dead after shooting One person was killed Saturday and at least two more shot during a second night of protests downtown, Indianapolis Police Chief Randal Taylor confirmed in a hastily called late-night press conference. ""Enough is enough,"" Taylor said as sirens blared and fire trucks raced past on the street. ""Indianapolis, we are better than this. Downtown is not safe at this time.” Police did not have details on the individual who was killed nor the conditions of the others shot. Shortly before 1 a.m., the department tweeted again that it was investigating additional reports of shootings downtown. The shootings did not involve officers, police said. Protests during the day Saturday had been peaceful. — Staff of The Indianapolis Star Nashville: Fires at courthouse and City Hall building Fires in Nashville led Mayor John Cooper to declare a state of civil emergency. Police announced a 10 p.m. curfew for the city, and Gov. Bill Lee deployed the National Guard. Dozens of protesters had gathered on the steps of Nashville's criminal courthouse and City Hall after a rally and march. Demonstrators smashed windows with rocks and other materials, drawing a swarm of police. The situation at the building appeared to subside around 7:30 p.m. By 8:15 p.m., fire was visible from a first-floor office at the courthouse. A short time later, police with riot gear arrived as a fire burned inside a window at City Hall. Officers deployed tear gas as demonstrators clustered in the center of Public Square Park. — Staff of The Tennessean Reno, Nevada: Fires at City Hall; National Guard, curfew in place The Nevada National Guard is en route to downtown Reno, the city's police chief said, after protests there turned violent Saturday. Gov. Steve Sisolak tweeted he activated the Nevada National Guard. A group of people broke windows at Reno City Hall Saturday night and set fires there following hours of protest in the area. Responding Reno police fired tear gas into City Hall. Items such as a couch inside were on fire but soon put out. Police dispersed the protesters as some chanted ""Hands up, don't shoot."" Washoe County residents, which includes all residents in Reno and Sparks, are under curfew until 7 a.m. Sunday, police said Saturday evening. — Amy Alonzo, Siobhan McAndrew and Benjamin Spillman, Reno Gazette Journal New York City: Videos show vehicle's confrontation with crowd Hundreds of protesters walked against traffic in Manhattan on Saturday afternoon, temporarily stalling vehicles on 7th Ave. The group chanted: “No justice, no peace” and “Whose streets? Our streets.” Late Saturday, videos circulated on social media that show a police vehicle driving into a crowd of protesters, after objects were thrown at the vehicle. Mayor Bill de Blasio called the video ""upsetting"" and said he wishes the officer ""hadn't done that."" He added: ""It’s clear that a different element has come into play here, who are trying to hurt police officers and trying to damage their vehicles."" He said the situation was started by a group of protesters converging on the police car and attacking it. Other video showed at least one vehicle on fire. An initially peaceful demonstration in the city had spiraled into chaos Friday, as protesters skirmished with police officers, destroyed police vehicles and set fires. Video posted to social media on Friday showed officers using batons and shoving protesters as they took people into custody and cleared streets. One video showed an officer slam a woman to the ground as he walked past her. Denver: Car crashes into police; weapons confiscated Three officers and a civilian were ""severely"" injured when a car crashed into a Denver police vehicle, the police department tweeted late Saturday. Police said they were searching for a Chevrolet compact car with Wyoming plates. The city had enacted a curfew from 8 p.m. until 5 a.m. A few agitators, the department said, were ""hijacking"" Floyd's memory. Police shared photos of a gun, a gas canister and a hatchet — all of which were confiscated Saturday. ""Last night, agitators brought crowbars, baseball bats, assault rifles, hand guns and improvised flash-bangs which were thrown at police officers and protesters,” Chief Paul Pazen said in a statement on Saturday. Police on Saturday announced 34 arrests over the last two nights in Denver amid Floyd protests. San Francisco: Fireworks outside mayor’s apartment after curfew Videos from the scene show protesters lighting fireworks outside of San Francisco Mayor London Breed’s apartment. Late Saturday, Breed made an announcement alongside the city’s police chief, sheriff and fire chief implementing a curfew from 8 p.m. until 5 a.m. She also said the National Guard is on standby for the city. “If you are home, please stay home. If you are in our city from other places, please go back to the city that you live in. Please do not come into San Francisco and destroy our city,” Breed said. Breed said there were peaceful protests early Saturday, but the violence and vandalism exhibited later in the day are “something we will not tolerate.” Chief Bill Scott said officers were dealing with looting and people breaking windows.

No peace!"" and ""I can't breathe!"" – a phrase Floyd was heard saying before his death – in Lafayette Square, across the street from the White House and along surrounding streets. Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., stood with peaceful protesters outside the White House during the afternoon. Protesters stood facing a line of police wearing helmets and holding shields, the officers with their backs to the White House. At times, some protesters tried to knock over barriers or attacked officers around the White House perimeter, although none scaled the surrounding fence, according to the Secret Service. ""Multiple"" special agents and uniformed officers were injured when some protesters threw bricks, rocks, bottles and fireworks at officers, officials said. Officers responded by firing tear gas to break up the crowds. President Donald Trump attended the historic SpaceX rocket launch in Florida during the afternoon, but arrived back at the White House around 8:30 p.m. as protests raged outside. As the presidential helicopters buzzed overheard near the White House grounds, some demonstrators shouted obscenities and shook their fists.

Police responded by pushing the crowd away, firing tear gas and bean bag rounds as they marched forward. At one point, some in the crowd tried to build a makeshift barrier with trash cans, but police pushed through and arrested several people. Others fled down streets and alleys. — Dan Horn, Madeline Mitchell, Cameron Knight and Sharon Coolidge, The Cincinnati Enquirer Des Moines, Iowa: Protesters throw fireworks at police Police in riot gear met protesters marching on the state’s Capitol building. Some protesters could be seen throwing fireworks at police. At the Polk County Courthouse, protesters scattered after police fired tear gas into the crowd.

One person was seen breaking a glass window. — Des Moines Register staff Minneapolis: Projectiles fired to clear protesters The National Guard started moving into downtown Minneapolis on Saturday, after days of unrest. ""The situation in Minnesota is no longer in any way about the murder of George Floyd. It is about attacking civil society, instilling fear and disrupting our great cites,"" Gov. Tim Walz said in a press conference. An 8 p.m. curfew would be strictly enforced, major highways would be closed and those on the streets Saturday night could be subject to arrest, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey and Saint Paul Mayor Melvin Carter said Saturday night. “Don’t go out of your homes; don’t make things more difficult,” Walz said. As curfew approached, hundreds of protesters sat to await the arrival of law enforcement near Fifth Precinct. One commented that police couldn't arrest the whole group. Soon, black-clad law enforcement approached to the sound of explosions. Some demonstrators chanted: “Hands up, don’t shoot!” Police officers fired nonlethal projectiles toward masses of people, including a crowd of journalists gathered in an alley next to a looted store. Protesters reported tear gas being used. Some people hobbled away from an intersection appearing to be injured. ""State Patrol troopers are moving in to secure the Fifth Precinct. Go home and obey the curfew order now,"" Minnesota Department of Public Safety tweeted. — Trevor Hughes and Jordan Culver, USA TODAY Los Angeles: Looting and destruction mount, mayor sets curfew Looting and property destruction mounted Saturday in Los Angeles as police worked to disperse protesters after the third evening of mass demonstrations.

Police set up skirmish lines throughout the downtown area and fired non-lethal ammunition in at least one incident, City News Service reported. Garcetti requested the National Guard. Protesters looted several downtown businesses, including a Target store, a Rite Aid, a Starbucks and jewelry stores near Sixth Street and Broadway. Fires were ignited near the intersection of Hill and Seventh Street, and in one case, a person threw the hose being used by a firefighter into a smoldering fire. Garcetti urged residents to go home. “When things burn, it is not the time to stay,” he said. Taking part in civil unrest, he added, does a disservice to Floyd's memory. He noted Los Angeles has seen unrest over racial issues before, a nod to the Watts Riots in 1965 and the disturbance after the Rodney King verdict that exonerated the police officers who were videotaped beating him in 1992. — Chris Woodyard, USA TODAY Fayetteville, North Carolina: Reporter injured as looters break into J.C. Penney Protests turned violent in Fayetteville even after police opted to close access to downtown areas of the city.

When police horses entered the area, a chaotic few seconds followed: Police barricades tumbled to the ground and people fell down. Glass bottles flew through the air. At one point the crowd chanted: ""No justice, no peace."" The standoff was a dramatic contrast from a peaceful protest march earlier in the evening. That demonstration had apparently ended without arrests, and the police had largely let it play out on its own, without interference. Most of the crowd from the protest march left around 9 p.m. — Laura Testino, Desiree Stennett, Daniel Connolly, Corinne S Kennedy and Samuel Hardiman, Memphis Commercial Appeal Detroit: Day starts peacefully, turns violent Saturday, in the light of day, the protesting crowd appeared to be mostly peaceful, with police following marching protesters closely and even handing out masks, a coronavirus precaution, to those who did not have them.

In the skirmishes, Detroit Free Press reporters were exposed to tear gas, and a phone was violently knocked out of a photographer's hand. Police in riot gear, supported by armored cars, moved toward protesters. Crowds began to gather at about 4:30 p.m. Most wore masks, and many carried signs, some with angry slogans.

Former officer Derek Chauvin faces the charges, which activist groups said are inadequate. Video from a bystander showed Chauvin pressing his knee on Floyd's neck for more than eight minutes. The demonstrations Saturday were part of a National Day of Protest against Chauvin and police brutality nationwide. Protesters called out the names of other people of color killed by police, including Louisville's Breonna Taylor, 26, an ER tech who was shot and killed by police in March. George Floyd protests:How did we get here? Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, called protesting ""right and necessary. It’s an utterly American response."" But, he said, ""needless destruction is not. Violence that endangers lives is not."" Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said even peaceful protests weren't welcome after an 8 p.m. curfew Saturday. Highways were closed, and officials urged all residents to stay home, saying it was necessary to separate peaceful protesters from those intending to cause further damage to a city reeling after days of fiery demonstrations. After curfew began, law enforcement started using tear gas, smoke grenades and nonlethal projectiles to break up gatherings. In Washington:D.C. Mayor Bowser responds to Trump's criticism over police after George Floyd protests President Donald Trump attended the historic SpaceX rocket launch in Florida Saturday and returned to the White House on Marine One at around 8:30 p.m. as protests raged outside. He used his address at the Kennedy Space Center to offer a stern warning against violence by ""rioters, looters and anarchists."" Biden's statement late Saturday came a day after he said he spoke to Floyd's family. He made a short address afterward, on Friday afternoon. In Saturday's statement, he referred to that conversation: ""As president, I will help lead this conversation – and more importantly, I will listen. I will keep the commitment I made to George’s brother, Philonise, that George will not just be a hashtag. ... Please stay safe. Please take care of each other.""

Demanding justice for George Floyd and pleading for changes to address racial inequities in their community, Wilmington residents marched miles through the city Saturday in what began as a peaceful protest. But as day gave way to night, protesters began looting businesses, leaving shattered glass along sidewalks as dumpsters, trash cans and vehicles burned. Police in riot gear responded by cordoning off downtown streets. ""It's disheartening, disappointing,"" Wilmington Mayor Mike Purzycki said Sunday morning. ""I'm trying to reconcile what happened with Minneapolis with what happened here. I'm feeling the revulsion in both cases. I think it's important that all sides come together and try to understand the grievances, but talk about solutions."" Buy Photo Courtney Deppish cleans up whats left of 201 Convenient Store Sunday, May 31, 2020, after protests turned violent Saturday night in Wilmington. (Photo: Jerry Habraken, Delaware News Journal) Cities across the country protested Floyd's death Saturday, nearly a week after the 46-year-old black man died after being arrested by Minneapolis police. Footage of the arrest shows a white police officer, Derek Chauvin, kneeling on Floyd's neck for more than eight minutes while he was pinned to the ground. It all ensued amid the coronavirus pandemic, which has disproportionately affected minority groups while leading to strife over when businesses should be reopened. SATURDAY NIGHT: Wilmington protest for Floyd turns violent; police order people off the streets Alongside Wilmington residents, local and state officials walked down Market Street on Sunday morning past some of the most significant damage, as business owners began boarding up their storefronts and residents helped clean looted businesses. Many questioned how the protest turned violent as rapidly as it did while sympathizing with the protesters and their cause. Buy Photo Governor John Carney, right, speaks with one of the organizers of yesterdays peaceful protest in downtown Wilmington. (Photo: Jerry Habraken, Delaware News Journal) Addressing a group of reporters on Market Street on Sunday morning, Gov. John Carney attributed much of the damage to a handful of bad actors while praising those who were focused ""on the good."" He said Wilmington police ""did amazing under very difficult circumstances."" ""We need to be resilient, and we also need to address the serious issues that gave rise to the destruction,"" Carney said. Wilmington police have not said whether any arrests were made in relation to Saturday's protests, and city officials were preparing for ""a variety of scenarios"" Sunday. Carney gave no indication that a curfew would be implemented or that the National Guard would assist police, as other cities have done. Wilmington police called in for support from other police agencies after the mayhem became too much for the city police to handle on its own. 'Let's do it the right way' The protest began at 11 a.m. Saturday with several hundred people, but quickly grew to a crowd of more than 1,000. From Rodney Square to Wilmington police headquarters, down across the Christina River and onto I-95, protesters chanted, ""No justice, no peace."" One man held a sign listing the names of dozens of black people targeted or killed by police in recent years. Others donned T-shirts with Floyd's last words: ""I can't breathe.""

(Photo: Jerry Habraken, Delaware News Journal) SATURDAY AFTERNOON: Wilmington protesters demand justice for George Floyd The protests drew people of all ages, genders and colors — proof that ""this is not just a black thing anymore,"" said 21-year-old Jazmine Church, who marched with friends and family. ""This has been going on for years — it's not like this is new,"" Church said. ""I've been around to see these senseless killings happen, so it's good to see everybody participating, everyone upset. It's time for them to stop."" A moment of tension occurred when state police held long guns across from protesters who blocked I-95 early Saturday afternoon, which protesters said was unnecessary. The confrontation ended in applause when troopers agreed to store their weapons in their patrol cars. Youth advocate Keith James, one of the protesters who led the crowd to I-95, said before some began vandalizing businesses, the day's protests were marked by these types of civil negotiations with authorities. Protesters in the city helped keep peace when more unruly crowd members threatened police. Protesters saw that Sen. Tom Carper and his wife were stuck in traffic on the highway, James said. When a bottle struck their car, protesters helped them drive away safely. Carper's office confirmed the account. At the Wilmington police station, protesters got Purzycki and Police Chief Robert Tracy to agree to ask for the resignation of any officer who believes the Floyd killing was OK. ""That incident that happened out in Minneapolis, goddamnit, that set us back 20 or 30 years,"" Tracy said Saturday afternoon. ""It opened up a lot of wounds and rightfully so, and you know what? We got to let people express that anger. But we got to make sure they do it peacefully.""

(Photo: Jerry Habraken, Delaware News Journal) It wasn't until a group of protesters marched up Market Street in the early evening that the demonstration escalated. Protesters ultimately targeted businesses of all kinds downtown, smashing windows of restaurants and stealing merchandise from other businesses. The looting drew anger from other protesters, who decried the vandalism. At one point, a group of civilians guarded the Walgreens at Ninth and Market, arguing with those who supported the break-ins. BIDEN: 'We must not allow this pain to destroy us' ""We can’t act immature. We can’t afford it,"" said Drew Forrester, a 24-year-old from Wilmington. ""Let’s do it the right way."" As the sun set over Wilmington in the early evening, police officers on Market Street carried sticks and shields while protesters screamed, ""F--- the police."" As demonstrators smashed the windows of a BoostMobile on Market Street, a police officer was heard saying, ""Sergeant, get out your stick."" The scene played out over the next several hours until Wilmington police began clearing streets around 9:30 p.m., deeming the rally an ""unlawful assembly."" When asked, one man said he was taking part in the ransacking of businesses on Orange Street because peaceful protests don’t change things. As it stands now, the country isn’t made for black people, he said. ""Who is Independence Day for?"" he asked. ""It’s for people with liberty. We ain’t got that."" 'It's a delicate situation' City cleaning crews spent the early parts of the morning clearing glass from shattered storefronts, products stolen from stores and other debris from Market Street, Shipley Street and the surrounding area. Before 8 a.m., the streets and sidewalks were almost entirely clear. Many residents planned on cleaning the streets themselves Sunday morning but were pleased to see the city's effort when they arrived. Some shifted their attention to helping individual businesses, shuttling trash cans filled with shards of glass to the curb. ""The broken glass is a reflection of a system that needs to be fixed,"" said Ronnell Page, who was part of a small group cleaning stores along Market Street. ""People don’t know how delicate glass is until it breaks, and we see that it’s a delicate situation going on right here in our city. We just gotta focus on putting it together."" After walking through the shattered glass at the upscale Girard Craft & Cork wine store, Purzycki spoke with activist Chandra Pitts, who told Delaware Online/The News Journal she is organizing bail donations in anticipation of future protests. Pitts said she did not participate in Saturday night's events but defended those who did, saying peaceful protests and activism in legislative halls have not stopped police brutality nationwide. Some protesters resorted to hurting businesses, she said, to get the attention of business-friendly government officials and affluent residents. ""This is what it takes after years and years and years to get the attention of the administration, to now break something that you care about,"" Pitts said.

Some protesters took aim at the long-simmering inequality in Wilmington represented by the recently revitalized Market Street. As they surveyed the damage at Bardea, one of the first to be vandalized, some recalled the beloved — and cheaper — fried chicken eatery it had replaced. Still, looters destroyed the inside of several stores, including some many decades old. They left merchandise, displays and glass strewn across the first level of Al's Sporting Goods, which opened on Market Street in 1935. Broken glass littered the floor of a convenience store on Shipley, and gaping holes were left in the storefronts of many more businesses.

If you're going to protest, protest peacefully to get your message across."" Derrick Reed, owner of His Image Barber Lounge on Lancaster Avenue, went to Home Depot early Sunday morning to buy brooms and trash bags as one of many who planned to help with the cleanup effort. He said he wishes the protesters reached out to the city's leaders, police and other social groups ahead of time to work together on setting an example of a peaceful protest as ""we are all outraged."" ""The hurtful part is seeing all of these business owners out here and picking up the pieces,"" he said. Tim Pawliczek, owner of Cavanaughs at Market and East Seventh streets, said he felt trapped in the back of his restaurant as demonstrators stole shoes from the back of the Sneaker City on the same block and set fires behind him on Shipley Street. Cavanaughs was relatively unscathed but wooden boards still covered the doors Sunday morning, a day before Pawliczek intended to reopen after more than two months of being shut down due to the coronavirus pandemic.

At least one person is dead after being shot in Indianapolis. Police are investigating whether the incident was connected to demonstrations in the city. In Los Angeles, protesters blocked the 110 freeway downtown and were seen breaking windows of stores at The Grove mall. Floyd, 46, died after being arrested in Minneapolis on Monday. A video shows a police officer kneeling on his neck for at least seven minutes while Floyd is heard saying he cannot breathe. That police officer was arrested Friday and charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. Three other officers were present but have not been charged. All four were fired. Overnight curfews were enacted in several cities nationwide — including Chicago, Atlanta, Los Angeles, Louisville, San Francisco and Denver — as authorities sought to stem any violence. The National Guard was also activated in several states, including Texas, Georgia, Washington, Ohio and Kentucky. Law enforcement began to make arrests in Minneapolis after the 8 p.m. curfew there as crowds gathered at the 5th Precinct police building. Paul Schnell, the state corrections commissioner, said at a Saturday night press conference that an official count of arrests was not yet available but that authorities were “committed to do whatever it takes to bring order.” Former Vice President and presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden released a statement early Sunday morning condemning the violence and urging Americans to “take care of each other.” We are a nation in pain, but we must not allow this pain to destroy us. We are a nation enraged, but we cannot allow our rage to consume us. Please stay safe. Please take care of each other. https://t.co/Y224rANwUF — Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) May 31, 2020 “Protesting such brutality is right and necessary. It’s an utterly American response,” he wrote. “But burning down communities and needless destruction is not.” Biden added, “the act of protesting should never be allowed to overshadow the reason we protest.” 1 person fatally shot in Indianapolis At least one person has died after being shot in downtown Indianapolis Saturday night. Police Chief Randal Taylor said at a press conference that authorities were still investigating the incident’s connection to ongoing demonstrations in the city. “Downtown is not safe at this time,” Taylor said. He urged residents who do not live in the area to leave. Mayor Joe Hogsett called the day’s protests “successful” in a tweet, but condemned the “small group of people” that grew violent later in the night. This afternoon, our city hosted a successful protest that allowed hundreds to lift up their cause and have their voices safely heard. Since it ended, a small group of people have chosen to diminish that activism through inexcusable violence. It is unacceptable, and it must stop. — Mayor Joe Hogsett (@IndyMayorJoe) May 31, 2020 Police cruisers seen going through crowds in New York Several videos of protests in New York showed a police patrol vehicle driving through crowds of protesters. Protesters are seen surrounding and throwing debris at a car while another one drove into them. Mayor Bill de Blasio called the footage “upsetting” at a late-night press conference Saturday but said it was “inappropriate for protesters to surround a police vehicle and threaten police officers.” He addressed the city’s peaceful protesters, saying they were heard but urging them to go home. “We hear your desire to see these issues: relationship between police and community, the need for justice, the need for real change in our society,” he said. “We appreciate and respect all peaceful protests, but it is now time for people to go home.” California governor declares state of emergency in LA County Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti requested assistance to restore order Saturday night amid protests. A curfew began at 8 p.m. PT and is expected to end at 5:30 a.m. local time. The LAPD said hundreds of protesters were arrested amid the protests. An unlawful assembly was declared in the the Mid-Wilshire area and businesses were asked to close. Protesters blocked the 110 freeway in downtown LA and videos taken at protests showed looting and broken windows at stores in The Grove mall. Garcetti urged protesters to “take a breath” and “step away” at a press conference. He asked residents to go home and protest peacefully at a later time.

At least 13 police officers were injured in Philadelphia when peaceful protests turned violent and at least four police vehicles were set on fire. In New York City, dangerous confrontations flared repeatedly as officers made arrests and cleared streets. A video showed two NYPD cruisers lurching into a crowd of demonstrators who were pushing a barricade against one of them and pelting it with objects. Several people were knocked to the ground, and it was unclear if anyone was hurt. “The mistakes that are happening are not mistakes. They’re repeated violent terrorist offenses and people need to stop killing Black people,” Brooklyn protester Meryl Makielski said. Few corners of America were untouched, from protesters setting fires inside Reno’s city hall, to police launching tear gas at rock-throwing demonstrators in Fargo, North Dakota. In Salt Lake City, demonstrators flipped a police car and lit it on fire. Police said six people were arrested and a police officer was injured after being struck in the head with a baseball bat. In Ferguson, Missouri, where Michael Brown Jr. was shot and killed by a white police officer in 2014, sparking a wave of protests throughout the country, mostly peaceful protests turned late Saturday and six officers hit with rocks and fireworks were injured. Police have arrested at least 1,669 people in 22 cities since Thursday, according to a tally by The Associated Press. Nearly a third of those arrests came in Los Angeles, where the governor declared a state of emergency and ordered the National Guard to back up the city’s 10,000 police officers as dozens of fires burned across the city. The damage in U.S. cities came as many Americans plan to return to in-person church services on Sunday for the first time in several weeks since the pandemic forced a ban on large gatherings. Pastors in pulpits across the country will likely be urging peace amid the rubble of riots. Trump appeared to cheer on the tougher tactics Saturday night, commending the National Guard deployment in Minneapolis, declaring “No games!” and saying police in New York City “must be allowed to do their job!” The National Guard has been released in Minneapolis to do the job that the Democrat Mayor couldn’t do.

The city ordered all retail stores to close immediately and moved up its mandatory, citywide curfew by two hours to begin at 6 p.m. Community members and business owners helping to clean up vandalized properties were urged to return home by 5 p.m. All Center City streets are closed to vehicle traffic until further notice. The closure area runs from Vine to South streets and from the Delaware River to the Schuylkill River, and includes all bridges and expressway entrances and exits. Gov. Tom Wolf has ordered the Benjamin Franklin Bridge closed to foot and vehicle traffic until further notice. The Walt Whitman bridge remains open. SEPTA will shut down all service starting at 6 p.m. until at least 6 a.m. on Monday. This includes all bus and trolley routes, service on the Broad Street and Market-Frankford subway lines, Regional Rail and the Norristown High Speed Line. All SEPTA bus routes, trolleys, the Market-Frankford, Broad Street, and Norristown High Speed Lines are suspended at 6 p.m. today until further notice due to civil unrest and vandalism. — SEPTA (@SEPTA) May 31, 2020 All city services and Philadelphia government operations — except for public safety — will be closed tomorrow. City-run meal distribution sites normally open on Mondays have been postponed to Tuesday. A City Council budget hearing set for Monday — for which Philadelphia Police are expected to get a $14 million increase under Kenney’s post-COVID-19 budget — has been postponed. The city’s regularly scheduled coronavirus briefing scheduled for Monday has been canceled. City Managing Director Brian Abernathy said that as of 12 p.m., there have been 10 additional arrests for looting. Thirteen code violation notices were given out for failure to disperse. In the area of 52nd and Market streets, five officers were injured and officers were hit with bricks, rocks and Molotov cocktails. Abernathy said tensions in Kensington have started to calm down, but that the area around 52 and Market streets in West Philly is still “very much an active situation.” Center City, Abernathy said, has remained “relatively calm” in comparison to yesterday. However, WHYY education reporter Avi Wolfman-Arent was arrested while covering at a protest near Independence Hall, for allegedly failing to follow a dispersal order, and despite identifying himself as a member of the press. Im a reporter with ⁦@WHYYNews⁩ in Philly. Yes, I was just arrested. A very brief explanation below: pic.twitter.com/5u5h4A7erS — Avi Wolfman-Arent (@Avi_WA) May 31, 2020 Abernathy also said police are responding to other issues of violence, including a quadruple shooting in Kensington, where a 12-year-old boy and three adults were shot. The city managing director closed Sunday evening’s press briefing with a message to TV news media. “As your cameras continue to roll over scenes of looting, over cars that are putting TVs in their trunks, know that our investigators are tracking all those license plates you’re capturing,” Abernathy said. “We’re paying attention to all the faces being captured, so keep doing it because you’re helping our investigations.” State officials said the National Guard has also been requested in Montgomery County, where the King of Prussia Mall and an AT&T store on Route 202 and Allendale Road in Montgomery County were looted Saturday, according to CBS3. Upper Merion on Sunday declared a “township emergency.” A curfew will be in effect from 8 p.m. through 6 a.m. Monday. Upper Merion Township officials detailed Saturday’s events in a Facebook post late Sunday evening. The post says community members held a protest that “demonstrated exactly how a peaceful protest works: non-violent, non-threatening freedom of expression from the public and tolerance from authorities.” But a separate event with no connection to the protest took place hours later at the King of Prussia Mall, where hundreds of people stole items from the mall and destroyed property. Nine people were arrested, officials said, and none of them were Upper Merion residents. In a tweet late Sunday afternoon, President Donald Trump called for “law and order” in Philadelphia, and suggested calling in the National Guard. Law & Order in Philadelphia, NOW! They are looting stores. Call in our great National Guard like they FINALLY did (thank you President Trump) last night in Minneapolis. Is this what voters want with Sleepy Joe? All Dems! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 31, 2020 Looting spreads outside Center City As roughly 500 people gathered outside City Hall for a peace rally Sunday afternoon, looting and vandalism continued, including outside Center City, alarming many residents. Groups of people could be seen leaving Port Richmond stores with armloads of merchandise, according to NBC10. At 52nd Street in West Philly, multiple police cars burned, and people looted stores in the area. Larneice Poindexter said she was at the corner of 52nd and Walnut streets when she saw someone had lit a trashcan on fire at a nearby McDonald’s. She said officers started shooting rubber bullets and using tear gas to control the crowds. Poindexter said she came to the area for some pizza and lamented how unsafe it feels in her neighborhood. “I was born when Martin Luther King was killed … April 4th, 1968 and I can’t believe I’m living what that man lived,” she said. “His dream back then, to see us be free — I want my 14-year-old autistic son to live. I won’t want him to walk down the street and he can’t understand ‘Stop, put your hands up,’ so he can’t go nowhere without Momma.” “The man got charged with third-degree murder, they fired him, that’s the best you’re going to get,” said Tahira Young, of West Philly, of now-fired Minneapolis Police Officer Derek Chauvin who is charged with murdering George Floyd. Young said she thinks the rioting misses the point because it hurts residents and businesses where she lives. “It wasn’t fair for the man to do what he did, but it’s not fair for them to do what they did, because these merchants didn’t do anything for their property to be stolen, broken and rioted in,” she said. “McDonald’s didn’t do anything to get burned down.” City Councilmember Jamie Gauthier, who represents West Philadelphia, said she witnessed the unrest on 52nd Street firsthand, and said “we cannot allow this to continue.” Gauthier said that as protesters became more aggressive, police also increased their aggression and intimidation. “The 3rd District is a vibrant community, and 52nd Street is at its heart,” Gauthier said in a statement. “It is tragic to see our own small businesses — the lifeblood of this neighborhood — being destroyed. And I’m terrified for these youth, because I don’t want them to get hurt in the process.” She added that as a mother of two Black sons, she understands the outrage and that people have reached a “boiling point.” “I am looking forward to tomorrow, though: to rebuilding, and to generating real, substantive change,” Gauthier said. “We as City leaders must hear what people are angry about and respond — not just placate and go back to business as usual.” For Gloria Cartagena, the combination of the coronavirus pandemic shutdowns and the citywide chaos is “a double whammy” to North Philly residents. In Kensington, where she lives, the poverty rate is 44% — nearly double that of the rest of the city. Combined with a severe opioid crisis in the neighborhood that has exacerbated homelessness and made social distancing difficult, Cartagena said when the rest of Philadelphia gets hit hard, Kensington gets hit harder. “A lot of these people [looting], they’re not even from this area,” said Cartagena, former president and current secretary of Somerset Neighbors for Better Living. “They’re from West Philly, Southwest Philly, even Delaware … but we live here, we sleep here, we eat here, we play here, and we don’t feel safe.” Cartagena has been doing community work for the past 35 years. She says the residents who called her this morning were frustrated, scared, feeling trapped. The looting they described was “out of control.” Recent protests across the nation, as well as in Philly, have often targeted large corporations — the Port Richmond Walmart was looted, for example. But in Kensington, big chains weren’t the only ones that took damage. Jess Shoffner, an urban gardener and Kensington resident on the 500 block of Hart Lane, said she’d heard neighbors talking about a looted corner store only a block away. The fire station down the street, she said, “has been wailing sirens all morning … there were people running up Kensington Avenue, some wearing masks, some not. We don’t really know what’s going on.” ‘A slap in the face’ The mayor, who on Sunday morning toured the damage left behind on Walnut Street, said the images of residents turning out with brooms, shovels and trash bags to “restore their city” gave him hope. “I understand that the larger issues that fueled yesterday’s events remain,” Kenney said, explaining that the more violent destruction was born of decades of systemic racism and poverty, “two factors that work hand in hand to fuel anger and hopelessness.” The destruction, however, was “disappointing beyond words,“ Kenney said. “We’re better than what happened last night,” he said Sunday’s press conference came after an afternoon that saw about 3,000 people attend peaceful protests over police violence gave way to destruction by Saturday evening. Smaller groups of demonstrators set fire to at least nine structures, including multiple vehicles and the City Hall Starbucks. Some also smashed windows, set fire to mannequins and office furniture, vandalized and looted businesses on Chestnut and Walnut streets in Center City. Both Kenney and Outlaw reiterated that Saturday’s organized protests were peaceful and orderly, but that criminal activity would not be tolerated. Outlaw, Philadelphia’s first Black female police chief, also indicated that she too was affected by George Floyd’s death. “I wear many hats,” Outlaw said. “I’ve been a Black woman my entire life. I have Black sons. I enforce the law, but there is a very clear narrative here.” That narrative, Outlaw said, stemmed from “a lot of hurt and anger.” The police commissioner, responding to a question about whether a large percentage of arrests were tied to white people, described the destruction as in “misalignment” with the message carried out by Saturday’s peaceful protesters. “Frankly, those folks didn’t look like me,” Outlaw said, adding that the destruction was a “slap in the face” and a “setback for everything that’s been accomplished for those working to fix the issues within the criminal justice system.” Thirteen police officers were injured Saturday. Injuries included chemical burns to the face and arms, broken extremities and head injuries, per Outlaw. One officer remains hospitalized after reportedly being struck by a vehicle. Officials are still working to confirm the number of civilians injured. Four police vehicles were set ablaze, including one state police vehicle. Nine fires were set to various structures, and 207 arrests were made. Outlaw said she expects the number of arrests to grow. About 40 people are expected to face felony burglary charges stemming from the protests and looting Saturday afternoon and evening. At least one person will likely be charged with aggravated assault against a police officer, and three people face gun charges. These are in addition to 52 citations for curfew violations and nine civil citations. Paul Hetznecker, a criminal defense and civil rights attorney, says these criminal cases differ from mass arrests at previous protests like the 2016 Democratic National Convention. In that instance, Hetznecker says the city used “catch and release” for demonstrators who charged a fence at the Wells Fargo Center in South Philadelphia. Prior to the 2016 DNC, City Council passed an ordinance decriminalizing such incidents like disturbing the peace, and failure to disperse during protests, essentially charging protestors with a civil offense. Saturday’s protests led to a greater level of property destruction and theft. Hetznecker, who is part of a team of lawyers offering to defend those arrested pro bono, also defended protestors at the 2000 Republican National Convention when more than 400 people were arrested and some charged with felonies. At that event, there were just a few incidents of property damage and more than 90% of those who faced charges were acquitted. He says the current protests are a very different level of social unrest than those that have taken place in the past in the city. Vandalism, looting and burglary, he says, are not protected by the First Amendment. “Certainly the overriding issue of police abuse and institutional racism historically within police departments across this country is the most significant issue,” he said, “not only from the death of George Floyd, but from the death of every African American individual who has been killed at the hands of police.”",0.0

He had watched from his home in the Mantua section of the city – ""disappointed in the continued hurt and pain"" – as more than 100 people were arrested and more than a dozen police officers were injured after what started as peaceful protests Saturday afternoon resulted in destruction and devastation. Washington, 52, arrived with a broom and dustpan around 11:30 a.m., but realized quickly he was late to the party.

He and a few other African Americans had just stood in front of a line of police outside a Modell's sporting goods store on Chestnut Street. They bowed their heads and prayed. ""We just prayed that they'd be safe, and we don't hold any hatred and animosity toward them because they're cops and white men,"" Washington said. ""I think we as human beings have to see the value and preciousness of each individual life. ... The protest stems from a feeling that we as black people do not feel valued in society."" City officials on Sunday were preparing to limit access to Center City, diverting people away to help avoid further destruction Sunday night. A curfew of 6 p.m. was in effect. Additionally, traffic into Philadelphia from New Jersey via the Ben Franklin Bridge was being shut down. Retail businesses were ordered closed Sunday afternoon. In order to fully enforce the 8 p.m. curfew, all retail establishments must close immediately.

As the curfew lifted Sunday morning, small pockets of looting continued on Chestnut Street, including at that Modell's where Washington and others prayed with police. Around 11:50 a.m., police surrounded a black man on Walnut Street between 15th and 16th streets and arrested him while dozens looked on. Some had their phones out recording the incident, others stood across the street with brooms in their hands, turning around to continue cleaning as the man was ushered into the back of a police van.

Officer Derek Chauvin, a white police officer with over a dozen complaints for brutality during the course of his career, kneeled on Floyd’s neck for 8 minutes and 46 seconds — even though Floyd was lying face down on the ground and hand-cuffed from behind. Officer Thomas K. Lane held Floyd’s legs down and Officer J. Alexander Keung held his back. The other arresting officer, Tou Thao, stood by and watched. Floyd protested that he could not breathe. Under the circumstances, it is clear that Floyd posed no threat to anyone. Officer Chauvin continued kneeling on Floyd’s neck for 2 minutes and 53 seconds after Floyd had become unresponsive. When bystanders pleaded on Floyd’s behalf, they were threatened with being pepper-sprayed. Floyd was tortured to death. This was a lynching of a black man, pure and simple.

(Photo: Darnella Frazier Via Storyful) And, for what? He was accused of trying to pass a counterfeit bill at a deli. While one cannot justify passing counterfeit currency, if that is exactly what Floyd did, since when does that warrant a death sentence? And, since when do the police have the right to be judge, jury and executioner of the accused? The black and brown victims of police brutality are too numerous to name all of them, but here are a few: Sandra Bland Michael Brown Christian Cooper Sean Bell Oscar Grant Eric Garner Freddie Gray Yvonne Smallwood Philando Castille Tamir Rice Trayvon Martin was killed by George Zimmerman, who was not an actual police officer, but got off anyway. One of the most infamous of these cases was that of Amadou Diallo, an African immigrant who was shot 41 times by police officers of the New York City street crimes unit in 2000. What was his “crime?” When asked to show his identification he reached into his back pocket to retrieve his wallet. These cases are all disheartening and enraging at the same time. They are the reason for the demand that Black Lives Matter, which means that “Black Lives Also Matter,” not that ""Only Black Lives Matter."" If there is anything positive to take away from this it is that people of all races are speaking up about this. The movement for Black Lives is multi-racial. A woman cries as she joins protesters at Union Square in Manhattan on Saturday, May 30, 2020.

The organization 100 Blacks in Law Enforcement appreciated the song and supported Springsteen. As a white man, I have a duty to recognize that I benefit from white privilege whether I seek it or not in ways that are obvious and in others that are not so obvious. White people have a duty to educate other white people about white privilege and the importance of speaking out and standing with our black and brown sisters and brothers to demand justice for George Floyd and every other person of color who is wrongfully killed by the police.

The announcement on Saturday from the nation’s eighth-largest retailer came after Target stores in multiple cities became scenes of violence and unrest. Among the stores where aisles were ransacked was a Target in Minneapolis located near the city’s 3rd police precinct, where the four officers who were fired after Floyd’s death worked. The station was damaged by a fire last week. “We are heartbroken by the death of George Floyd and the pain it is causing communities across the country,” the Minneapolis-based company said in a statement. “At this time, we have made the decision to close a number of our stores.” A Target spokesperson said that the company is evaluating closures and limiting hours on a store-by-store basis. The majority of stores being closed are located in Minnesota, and in California, where protests in Los Angeles led the National Guard to be deployed. Stores will also close in Colorado, Illinois, Oregon and Pennsylvania. Despite the violence that has hit its stores, the company has voiced support for demonstrators. “The murder of George Floyd has unleashed the pent-up pain of years, as have the killings of Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor,” Target CEO Brian Cornell wrote in a public letter on Friday. “We say their names and hold a too-long list of others in our hearts.” It remains unclear whether the looting at Target stores was committed by demonstrators or whether they were the actions of unaffiliated bad actors. But the ongoing demonstrations have focused scrutiny on Target’s past work with law enforcement — including partnerships with agencies in at least 2o cities. In Minneapolis, the company partnered with police on a program that helped install closed-circuit television cameras in the downtown area. A 2010 report released with support from the company said the “genesis of the program was a widespread feeling some years ago in the city of Minneapolis that the downtown business district was not a pleasant place to work or visit.”",0.0

Many also had police bicycles, which they sometimes thrusted at protesters who weren’t moving or confronted the officers verbally. “One guy I remember distinctly was yelling ‘Faggot! Faggot! Faggot!’ at the police,” he said. The protest was organized by local activist Asa Khalif, who started the event shortly after 4 p.m. by using a megaphone to speak to the few dozen officers standing outside police headquarters. “We’re gonna take any motherf–kin’ street we want tonight,” Khalif said during a speech mentioning the city’s Frank Rizzo statue, the 1985 MOVE bombing and the team of attorneys promising to represent arrested protesters for free.

The group of largely young, white protesters began marching around 4:30 p.m., first heading east on Race Street and then south on 6th Street. “The general flow of the protesters was away from the police,” Wolfman-Arent said. “I didn’t see anyone charging the police.” The first clash, however, came around Arch Street, when a protester was tackled and sprayed with what Wolfman-Arent described as a “ruddy, orange-red substance.” Young woman was just lying on the ground.

That’s where Wolfman-Arent was arrested and handcuffed while face down on the ground in front of The Curtis Publishing Company building. “They claim at some point a dispersal warning was given,” he said of police. “I did not hear a dispersal warning. … In fairness, I was wearing my headphones, so it’s possible that that noise was muffled for me.” Kimberly Paynter, a WHYY photojournalist also on the scene, but who was not arrested, said she did not hear a dispersal warning either. She said she did not see Wolfman-Arent get arrested. Wolfman-Arent was transported to a police station at 17th Street and Montgomery Ave., near Temple University, with seven other protesters. He said the face-covering he was wearing was removed by police ahead of the ride. For all but one of those seven, it was their first time being arrested at a protest, Wolfman-Arent learned. “I thought, you know, maybe the people who go to these smaller protests, maybe they’re the people who are the hard-core ones,” he said. “But by their telling, they weren’t.” Wolfman-Arent said the recorder and boom microphone he was carrying during the protest were confiscated by police, but returned following his release.

Floyd died after a Minneapolis Police officer kneeled on his neck as fellow officers looked on. All four officers were fired, with the officer holding Floyd down charged with murder, but not in the first degree. State Police were involved in a Wilmington demonstration Saturday that blocked I-95 through the city, with protesters reportedly dispersing after troopers put away their long guns. Protests turned violent later in the night with looting along Market Street. Police around the nation have come under criticism for using excessive force in dealing with protesters. Philadelphia ordered a 6 p.m. curfew as looting continued on Sunday. The State Police statement is as follows: In light of the recent tragedy and current events that have struck our nation, the Delaware State Police remain committed to our mission to serve and protect our citizens. With protests occurring throughout the United States, we understand that many of our citizens here in Delaware also want to exercise their 1stAmendment Right and have their voices heard to include the right to peaceably assemble. Our goal is to allow our citizens to protest as safely as possible, while we protect individuals as well as public and private property. The Delaware State Police will continue to do our part and see that these protests remain peaceful. Over the past several days, some peaceful demonstrations in cities across the country have turned violent. We are asking our citizens to do their part in helping us protect our communities by refraining from violence. We also ask our citizens to report any suspicious activity and if they witness a crime to call their local police department, Delaware Crime Stoppers at 1-800-TIP-3333, the Anti-Terrorism Tip Line at 1-800-FORCE-12, or in the event of an emergency 9-1-1.

Some cities, including Minneapolis, Atlanta and Seattle, saw clashes with police, buildings and cars set afire, and looting. By evening, many demonstrations had given way to another night of violence and destruction, with protesters ignoring curfews imposed in dozens of cities. Police used tear gas and stun grenades and fired rubber bullets in attempts to disperse the crowds. Floyd, a 46-year-old black man, died in police custody last Monday. Video shows a Minneapolis police officer had his knee on Floyd’s neck for nearly nine minutes shortly before his death. Tensions were already simmering following the deaths of Ahmaud Arbery in February and Breonna Taylor in March. Arbery, a 25-year-old black man, was jogging through a Glynn County, Ga., neighborhood when he was shot dead. Three white men were arrested last month after state investigators took over the case from local authorities. Protests also continued for a fourth straight night in Louisville, as activists call for justice for Taylor. Police shot and killed the 26-year-old black woman in her home. Truck barrels into Minneapolis protesters In Minneapolis, a semitrailer plowed through a crowd of protesters marching on an interstate highway near downtown that had been closed to traffic. Authorities say no one was injured when the truck drove into the crowd at a high speed, westbound on Interstate Highway 35. According to the Minnesota Department of Public Safety, the driver may have been unaware of the highway closure. “It appears the semi was on I-35W as authorities were closing the road. It didn’t appear to drive through any barricades,” the department tweeted. Some protesters jumped on top of the truck, and as it stopped, they dragged the driver out of the front seat and started beating him. The driver, identified by police as Bogdan Vechirko of Otsego, Minn., is being held on probable cause for assault. He was taken to a hospital and is being treated for his injuries. “He was driving a gas tanker,” said Rhys Gailah, 39, who was in the middle of a sit-in listening to speakers when the truck came barreling through. “He came driving at least 50 miles per hour through the crowd. Everyone was sitting. It was peaceful.” State Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington says authorities had shut down the freeway so the protesters, who numbered from 4,000 to 5,000, could safely demonstrate. Before the incident, the protest had appeared peaceful. Tensions flare in the nation’s capital Protests continued in Washington, D.C., with marches from a historically black university to a park just across from the White House. The peaceful marchers had a city police escort as they walked the nearly 2 miles from Howard University to Lafayette Square. Protesters chanted about the death of Floyd and other African Americans who have died following police violence. “Even in the middle of a pandemic, cops are killing us,” read one sign carried by protester Elizabeth Betts. “It’s crazy how even in the middle of a pandemic, black people have to protest like this,” she said. “We are at a point where it’s the same story, the same things are happening. I’m tired of this.” The demonstration in Lafayette Park turned violent during the night, as protesters threw bottles at police, set fires to cars and to the basement of St. John’s Church. The historic church has been attended by every president since James Madison. Police pushed the crowds away from the White House with bursts of tear gas. Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser had established a citywide curfew from 11 p.m. to 6 a.m. ‘Day of Reflection’ declared in Louisville for Monday Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer is calling for a Day of Reflection on Monday. He plans to hold a late morning virtual gathering on Facebook with faith leaders after another night of demonstrations in the city over the death of Breonna Taylor. Early Monday, police and National Guard reportedly shot and killed a man while trying to disperse a crowd outside of a food market in downtown Louisville, according to the Louisville Courier Journal. Law enforcement officers earlier fired tear gas into a crowd assembled in the Jefferson Square area of the city, NPR member station WFPL reported. At an evening press conference, Fischer again thanked those protesting peacefully but said others were “hijacking” their efforts. Atlanta officers terminated for excessive force Two Atlanta police officers have been terminated and three others placed on desk duty after a video of the arrest of two young African Americans leaving the protests Saturday night went viral. Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms announced the officers’ firing on Sunday, saying the footage “was disturbing on many levels.” “We understand our officers are working very long hours, under an enormous amount of stress,” Bottoms said. “But we also understand that the use of excessive force is never acceptable.” Georgia Public Broadcasting reported that veteran officers Mark Gardner and Ivory Streeter were terminated. The footage from Streeter’s body camera shows the officers confronting the pair as they were leaving the downtown protests after the 9 p.m. curfew went into effect. At roughly the 2:30 mark in the video, one of them is seen sitting in the driver’s seat of a car, recording officers arresting someone else. An officer opens the car door and asks the driver if he wants to go to jail. Several minutes later, officers approach the car again. One uses a baton to smash the driver’s side window. Police then use a taser on the driver, who has been identified by local media as Messiah Young. GPB said Young suffered an epileptic seizure, according to the Spelman College Student Government Association. Footage posted by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution also shows the passenger pleading with police to stop as they also used a taser against her. ‘They haven’t heard us’: Protests escalate in Southern California Vandalism and violence broke out after peaceful protests in Santa Monica and other parts of Southern California on Sunday, following a sequence of events that has become familiar in many U.S. cities in the past week. The new round of destruction came despite a curfew and the presence of the National Guard. “We tried kneeling,” protester Jesus Guzman, 19, told NPR’s Doualy Xaykaothao near the Santa Monica Pier. “We tried putting on those T-shirts that said I can’t breathe, we tried those hashtags, we tried doing it all peacefully, but they haven’t heard us, they haven’t done nothing.” “The violence, for him, is justified,” Xaykaothao reported. With store windows smashed, some shop owners in Santa Monica started cleaning up the mess overnight — the latest setback after weeks of forced closures because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Reporter in Long Beach, Calif., shot in throat by rubber bullet KPCC/LAist reporter Adolfo Guzman-Lopez was shot in the throat by a rubber bullet Sunday evening during protests in Long Beach, Calif. He believes the bullet was fired by Long Beach police, who had been firing the projectiles nearby. “I just got hit by a rubber bullet near the bottom of my throat,” Guzman-Lopez said via Twitter, posting an image of his wound. “I had just interviewed a man with my phone at 3rd and Pine and a police officer aimed and shot me in the throat, I saw the bullet bounce onto the street.” I just got hit by a rubber bullet near the bottom of my throat.

The reporter said he had just finished interviewing a man who had been kneeling in protest, when he was hit. “I talked to him for about a minute and just as I was finishing talking to him — right after I said, ‘Thank you,’ I heard a pop and I felt something, you know, the bottom of my throat and I saw something bounced onto the ground, and then I ran,” he said. “As I was running, I did start to feel its sting, and then I put my fingers to my throat and there was blood on my fingers.” A number of journalists have been hit with police projectiles during the protests, including MSNBC’s Ali Velshi, who was shot in the leg by a rubber bullet in Minneapolis, and a Louisville TV reporter who was shot with pepper balls.

It was the second time in a week that Biden left his home, following a brief Memorial Day wreath-laying ceremony at a veterans memorial in New Castle, Del. Biden has been campaigning exclusively from his house since coronavirus lockdowns began, repeatedly saying he is following stay-at-home orders issued by Delaware’s governor. We are a nation in pain right now, but we must not allow this pain to destroy us. As President, I will help lead this conversation — and more importantly, I will listen, just as I did today visiting the site of last night’s protests in Wilmington. pic.twitter.com/0h2ApbKT0C — Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) May 31, 2020 As cities across the country have been overwhelmed by sometimes violent protests responding to Floyd’s death, and as President Trump has stoked divisions with tweets about “vicious dogs” ready to respond to White House protests, labeling of Minnesota protesters as “thugs,” and repeated blaming of unrest on Democratic mayors and governors, Biden has tried to increase his visibility to portray a more empathetic and conciliatory approach to leadership. “We are a nation in pain, but we must not allow this pain to destroy us,” Biden wrote on Twitter and Facebook, alongside a picture of him on one knee, wearing a mask, speaking to an African American man holding a child. “We are a nation enraged, but we cannot allow our rage to consume us. We are a nation exhausted, but we will not allow our exhaustion to defeat us.” “The only way to bear this pain is to turn all that anguish to purpose,” Biden’s post continued. “And as President, I will help lead this conversation — and more importantly, I will listen, just as I did today visiting the site of last night’s protests in Wilmington.” Biden’s campaign posted a picture of the visit on social media, but provided no additional information about how long Biden stayed at the protest site, how many people he talked to, or when on Sunday he made the visit, which was not announced beforehand. While Biden and his campaign had purposely taken a low-visibility approach to the early days of the coronavirus crisis, preferring instead to keep the focus on President Trump and the daily press briefings credited with eroding the president’s approval ratings, Biden has been much more responsive to Floyd’s death and its aftermath, which have triggered a level of national protest not seen since the late 1960s. Biden delivered a five-minute speech from his Wilmington home Friday, framing Floyd’s death as the latest example of a centuries-old “open wound” of racism in the United States. Floyd’s death, Biden said, was “an act of brutality so elemental it did more than deny one black man in America his civil rights and human rights. It denied him of his very humanity and denied him of his life.” Earlier Friday, Biden spoke to Floyd’s family on the phone. Floyd’s brother, Philonise Floyd, told MSNBC on Saturday that during the call, “I asked him could he please, please get justice for my brother.” A later call from President Trump, Floyd said, was much briefer. “I was trying to talk to him, but he just kept, like, pushing me off,” Floyd said.",0.0

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 30, 2020 In a letter titled “Dear America,” civil rights leader Rev. William Barber II, a pastor at Greenleaf Christian Church in Goldsboro, North Carolina, said protesters have the right to decry “brutal and inhumane” treatment at the hands of police. “What if, instead of a President who tweets ‘when the looting starts, the shooting starts,’ we had leadership that could unequivocally say, ‘When you use police power in the name of the state to murder, lynch, and destroy, you will be prosecuted for your crimes,'” Barber wrote. Trump wasn’t alone in using loaded language. The Minnesota Department of Public Safety sent a tweet Saturday saying it would strengthen its response to “a sophisticated network of urban warfare.” Hours later, video emerged of police shooting paint projectiles at people gathered on the front porch of a home after curfew in Minneapolis. “Light ’em up,” a man is heard saying before the shooting began.

Trying to understand what he sees as increasingly aggressive law enforcement tactics, Williams said police shouldn’t “antagonize, provoke or instigate” protesters. “I don’t know what’s going to happen over these next few days in this country because they want these killer cops arrested and they’re not going to stop until they are,” Williams said, referring to the lack of charges against the other three officers at the scene when Floyd’s neck was pinned under Chauvin’s knee. “People are just sick and tired of being in this predicament, where innocent life has been taken at the hands of those who were to protect and serve us. We have not been heard.” Some protesters are increasing efforts to protect themselves. On Sunday, Black Lives Matter organizers in Tampa, Florida, had nearly 100 safety marshals in fluorescent vests patrolling their march, trained in de-escalation tactics. The group also had medics and enlisted lawyers and those with legal training to watch out for protesters’ rights from the sidelines. In New York, a police labor group, the Detectives’ Endowment Association, noted some police there had been attacked and patrol cars set ablaze. “As we do everything to stop NYC from burning, all we hear from elected officials is criticism,” the group tweeted. “Maybe they should try it on the front lines.” ___ Reeves and Stafford are members of the AP’s Race and Ethnicity team.

The protests over George Floyd's death hit the nation's capital Friday night as angry protesters arrived at Pennsylvania Avenue, leading to a lockdown at the White House. Outside the White House on Friday, Secret Service could be seen after 7 p.m. taking at least one person into custody. Videos showed a large group of protesters gathering, with some burning flags and knocking over barricades. There were also some violent encounters. The president remained there about an hour before returning to the residence, according to a Republican close to the White House and an administration official who spoke to the Associated Press on the condition of anonymity. It is currently unknown whether first lady Melania Trump and their son, Barron, were with the president but the family has been shaken by the size and venom of the crowds, AP reported. ""The White House does not comment on security protocols and decisions,” said White House spokesman Judd Deere. The Secret Service said it does not discuss the means and methods of its protective operations. Officials told The New York Times, which first reported the story, they never believed Trump was in danger but took the precaution of moving him to the bunker as tensions escalated. Trump has told advisers he worries about his safety, while both privately and publicly praising the work of the Secret Service, according to the AP. Floyd, an unarmed black man, died in Minneapolis police custody this week after a white officer pinned him to the ground under his knee. His death has sparked demonstrations against police brutality and racial discrimination in cities across the United States. Trump praised the Secret Service and said he “watched every move” from inside the White House during Friday's protest and that he “couldn't have felt more safe.” ""They let the ‘protesters’ scream & rant as much as they wanted, but whenever someone got too frisky or out of line, they would quickly come down on them, hard – didn’t know what hit them,"" he said Saturday. Trump continued, ""The front line was replaced with fresh agents, like magic. Big crowd, professionally organized, but nobody came close to breaching the fence. If they had, they would have been greeted with the most vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons, I have ever seen. That’s when people would have been really badly hurt, at least."" He also claimed DC Mayor Muriel Bowser didn't allow DC police to ""get involved"" and assist Secret Service, though Secret Service later said they were on the scene. Bowser, a Democrat, said on Twitter the city's police department would protect everyone regardless of whether the mayor agreed with them. ""While he hides behind his fence afraid/alone, I stand w/ people peacefully exercising their First Amendment Right after the murder of #GeorgeFloyd & hundreds of years of institutional racism There are no vicious dogs & ominous weapons.

Hannah Silbaugh decided to stay in the street. “We were protesting what the cops were doing and I wasn’t going to comply with them saying to leave,” Silbaugh said. “I wanted to exercise my right to peaceful protest.

Multiple people captured the kick on video, and her case quickly gained national attention, thanks to social media. Lt. Gov. John Fetterman and others condemned the police officer’s action after seeing the video. “This level of unnecessary use of force, along with all other instances of it across Pennsylvania yesterday, is unacceptable and diminishes us all,” Fetterman wrote on Twitter late Sunday afternoon. One video from the incident had 5 million views on Twitter shortly before 9:30 p.m. Sunday. It’s a two second video, showing an officer in riot gear and a protective helmet kicking Silbaugh as she sits covering her face. A longer video — which shows more of the street — appears to show officers spraying Silbaugh and multiple other people with some type of eye-irritant spray. The Saturday evening demonstration in Erie was one of many taking place across the country in response to the killing of George Floyd, a Minneapolis man who died after a police officer pressed his knee into his neck as he begged for air. Silbaugh, a 21-year-old Erie resident who works as a manager at a retail store, said she wanted to show support for the Black Lives Matter movement. “It’s very important to me because, yes, I am white, and yes, I have the privilege,” she said, “but there are .. blacks folks and (persons of color) that are dying and being injured by the hands of police brutality. And I think we all need to stand up.” She said she arrived at the protest around 8 p.m. or 8:30 p.m. She said the crowd “was rowdy, but they weren’t violent.” But the situation got worse. Silbaugh said she thinks the actions of police officers escalated the tension. The Erie City Police Department in a statement said the peaceful protest turned into a riot “when about 400 people descended on Erie City Hall.” The statement said protesters pounded on the doors, spray painted the building and shattered windows. The department said officers gave multiple warnings and released colored smoke, before calling in the SWAT team. At one point, Silbaugh said she and some other demonstrators positioned themselves between police in riot gear and a larger group of protesters. She said police told them to move, but she chose not to. She said police sprayed some type of chemical — she wasn’t sure if it was mace or pepper spray. The others who were with her left. “But I decided to stay seated,” Silbaugh said. Silbaugh said she held her hands up in front of her eyes to protect herself from the chemical officers used. She stayed sitting. And then she felt herself hitting the ground — she didn’t understand why until later. She said police told her that if she didn’t move, she would be tazed. She said she ran to the nearest side street to look for a bottle of water. “At that point, I was so discombobulated. I couldn’t see. I couldn’t breathe,” she said. A stranger gave her a bottle of water, so she could wash her eyes out. It seemed to her that there was more violence occurring in the streets, and she decided she wasn’t safe there. She went home and checked her phone and social media to look for updates and to see if everyone was safe. Then she saw a short video of a police officer kicking a person who was sitting on the ground. “I was like, ‘Oh, my goodness, that’s me,’” she said. She looked at more posts and found a longer video. Watching it felt different than experiencing it the first time. When she was in the street, she was confused, and knew she was being pushed around and sprayed. But the video gave her a clearer understanding of what happened. “It was really kind of an out of body experience because that’s the things that I’ve been seeing on the news,” she said. “And it happened to me, and it was just absolutely insane to see that happen.” Silbaugh said she stayed up all night. She didn’t go to an emergency room. After a few hours, she called a number for poison control because she still felt a “really horrible burning sensations” and was told to wait it out. She tried putting in contact lenses Sunday morning but it was too painful. She said she took cold showers to try to help, but even on Sunday evening she said she still felt the burning sensation in her arms and hands. She felt sore, especially where her body hit the ground. She said she had some bruises, but with all the chaos of the night, she wasn’t certain what caused them. A statement from the Erie City Police Department didn’t directly address Silbaugh’s case, but said police have “several hundreds of hours of videos to watch” and would review them. The department invited anyone who would like to make a formal complaint to do so. The police department said more than a dozen officers suffered injuries “from bruises, cuts and scrapes, to gashes and burns.” The department said the riot gear officers wore prevented them from being seriously injured or killed. “(W)hile our officers were being hit with bricks, rocks, water bottles, and fireworks, they just took it all. They showed a lot of restraint, held the line, and did not fire a single shot,” the department said. Pennsylvania State Police and the Millcreek Police Department assisted. In a news conference early Sunday evening, Erie Mayor Joe Schember said 11 businesses in downtown Erie were “hurt very badly,” and he described fire damage and broken windows there. Schember said he saw a video of a police officer striking Silbaugh, and that the city would investigate the case. “Obviously, it’s very brief. I know for a fact that police tried to get her to move very politely for quite a while,” Schember said. “Their line could not move beyond until she moved.” Schember said she wasn’t doing anything wrong, “but she was preventing the police from stopping the people behind her.”] At another point in the news conference, Schember called it “a terrible video.” The city has not identified the officer who is shown in the video striking Silbaugh. Frank Strumila, a media strategist for the city, said the investigation is ongoing. On Sunday evening, Silbaugh said she had not reached out to the police department, and she wasn’t sure if she would file a formal complaint or take any other action. She was grateful for all the support she has received. “I have received an outpouring of love,” she said. “…I have hundreds of people, you know, checking on me, making sure that I’m OK.”  ",0.0

More than 4,400 arrests have been made at protests nationwide since viral video emerged showing former Minneapolis Officer Derek Chauvin holding his knee to Floyd's neck for more than eight minutes on Memorial Day, resulting in Floyd's death. Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo apologized to Floyd's family Sunday, saying that firing Chauvin and the other three officers involved in the incident was the right thing to do. Peaceful protests continued to be marred by violence. The Minneapolis Department of Public safety confirmed a semi-truck drove into a group of peaceful protesters on Interstate 35. The driver of the truck was taken into custody, but not before protesters pulled him from the truck's cab. The driver was taken to the hospital with minor injuries. Elsewhere, vandalism and looting continued across the country, as did the use of tear gas and rubber bullets by police in confrontations with protesters. Reports: President Trump hustled to bunker amid Washington protests President Donald Trump was briefly moved to the White House's underground bunker Friday night to shelter in place as the protest grew outside the Executive Mansion, according to multiple outlets. The protests over George Floyd's death hit the nation's capital Friday night as angry protesters arrived at Pennsylvania Avenue, leading to a lockdown at the White House. Dozens of Secret Service agents were injured in clashes with protesters over the weekend, and videos showed a large group of protesters – some burning flags and knocking over barricades. CNN reported that the president remained in the bunker for about an hour before returning to the residence, and it is currently unknown whether the First Lady and their son, Barron, were with him. – Savannah Behrmann 2 Atlanta officers fired, accused of excessive force against protesters Atlanta officials fired two police officers and placed three on desk duty pending review over the alleged use of excessive force against protesters in a clash Saturday night. Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said she saw a video, which she called ""disturbing,"" of five officers pulling two college students out of a car downtown. Bottoms and police Chief Erika Shields made the announcement at a press conference after reviewing body-camera footage. ""We understand that our officers are working very long hours under an enormous amount of stress,"" Bottoms said. ""But we also understand that the use of excessive force is never acceptable."" – Jessica Flores At least 4,400 arrests since George Floyd's death: AP data At least 4,400 people nationwide have been arrested over days of protests since George Floyd’s death on Memorial Day, according to a tally compiled by The Associated Press. About 150 people were arrested in Minnesota after violating curfew amid protests Sunday night, the Minnesota Department of Public Safety tweeted. DPS continued to tweet about arrests late into the night and added, ""Even peaceful protesters who are breaking curfew are subject to arrest. Please go home and stay there."" DPS announced the arrests of more than 155 people Saturday night across multiple agencies. A dozen firearms were confiscated between the State Patrol and the Minneapolis Police Department. Historic St. John's Church near White House set ablaze amid DC protests As protesters gathered near the White House, flames were seen at Washington, D.C., landmark that bills itself as ""the church of the presidents."" The fire, apparently an act of arson, was in the basement of St. John's Church, across from the White House, The Washington Post reported, and was extinguished. It occurred as a demonstration was taking place outside. The gathering had attracted as many as 1,000 Sunday, who faced off against officers in riot gear. The Episcopalian church in Lafayette Square boasts on its website that every U.S. president since James Madison has attended services. Consecrated in 1816, the church also says the bell in its steeple, weighing almost 1,000 pounds, was cast in 1822 by Paul Revere's son Joseph. Illinois governor calls on National Guard to assist Chicago police Vandalism and fires were reported in several Chicago neighborhoods and some suburbs Sunday night after Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot severely restricted access to downtown following nights of violent protests. The communities of Tinley Park, Crestwood and Oak Lawn alerted residents to stay home due to civil unrest. Many businesses boarded up. Gov. J.B. Pritzker said he activated 375 Illinois National Guard soldiers to assist local law enforcement with street closures. ""This has been a scary and unsettling time, but I know we will get through this and begin the process of healing together,"" Lightfoot said in a midnight Twitter post. ""Please stay safe, and stay home."" Minneapolis police chief: George Floyd's death 'a violation of humanity' Minneapolis Police Department Chief Medaria Arradondo told CNN that George Floyd's death was ""a violation of humanity."" Speaking at the site where Floyd died after fired police officer Derek Chauvin held his knee to Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes, Arradondo apologized to Floyd's family and said he had a ""visceral"" and ""emotional"" reaction to the video that has sparked outrage across the nation. “There are absolute truths in life,"" Arradondo told CNN. ""We need air to breathe. ... I did not need days or weeks or months or processes or bureaucracies to tell me what occurred out here last Monday, it was wrong.” When asked why he fired the four officers involved in the incident that led to Floyd's death, Arradondo said: ""In my mind, this was a violation of humanity. This was a violation of the oath the majority of the men and women that put this uniform on — this goes absolutely against it. This goes contrary to what we believe in."" Protesters vandalize, set fire to police SUVs in New Jersey A group of people was captured on video destroying police SUVs in Trenton, New Jersey. In the video, the people vandalize three police vehicles, smashing windows and hitting and kicking the vehicles. One of the people opens a door to the SUV and those at the scene start lighting things inside of it on fire. Police eventually got to the scene and began pushing back protesters as the vehicles burned behind them. Minnesota AG Keith Ellison to lead prosecution of Derek Chauvin Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz announced Sunday that state Attorney General Keith Ellison will lead the prosecution in the Floyd case. Ellison called the case “unusual because of the way that Mr. Floyd was killed and who did it — at the hands of the defendant who was a Minneapolis police officer.” He said he expects to work together with Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman on the case. Ellison didn’t announce additional charges for Chauvin or charges for the three other officers involved in the incident. He added “prosecuting police officers for misconduct, including homicide and murder, is very difficult.” “Every single link in the prosecutorial chain will come under attack as we present this case to a jury or a fact finder and we need to make sure that we be absolutely prepared. We intend to be absolutely prepared.”",0.0

1622422292,2020-06-01 10:51:55,What is antifa and what does the movement want?,https://www.doverpost.com/zz/news/20200601/what-is-antifa-and-what-does-movement-want?rssfeed=true,en,False,,1599,dover post,http://www.doverpost.com,"Antifa — short for ""anti-fascist"" — is the name for loosely affiliated, left-leaning anti-racist groups that monitor and track the activities of local neo-Nazis. The movement has no unified structure or national leadership but has emerged in the form of local bodies nationwide, particularly on the West Coast. Some of the groups, such as the 10-year-old Rose City Antifa in Portland, the oldest antifa group in the U.S., are particularly well-organized and active online and on Facebook, while its members are individually anonymous. President Trump has singled out antifa as part of what he calls the alt-left in his initial claim that ""many sides"" were to blame for violence in Charlottesville the weekend of Aug. 12, not just the neo-Nazis, KKK and white nationalists. How is it pronounced? ""AN-tifa"" with the emphasis on the first syllable, which sounds more like ""on"" in English than ""an."" When did it start? Anti-fascist groups, particularly in Europe, have been around for many decades, notably in Italy, against Mussolini, and in Germany, against Hitler. In the postwar period, antifa groups resurged to fight neo-Nazi groups, particularly in Germany. In the U.S., the anti-fascist movements grew out of leftist politics of the late '80s, primarily under the umbrella of Anti-Racist Action. What does the movement want? The primary goal is to stop neo-Nazis and white supremacists from gaining a platform rather than to promote a specific antifa agenda. The antifa groups are decidedly anti-racist, anti-sexist and anti-homophobia, but also by and large socially leftist and anti-capitalist. How do the groups operate? Mark Bray, a lecturer and Dartmouth and author of the new book Antifa: The Antifascist Handbook, says the groups ""organize educational campaigns, build community coalitions, monitor fascists, pressure venues to cancel their events, organize self-defense trainings and physically confront the far right when necessary."" A main goal is to try to deny fascists a public forum, which is why they turn out in numbers to physically confront neo-Nazis, the KKK and white supremacists at public demonstrations. They also step in to protect counter-protesters at such events. In addition, antifa is particularly active in ""doxxing,"" or identifying neo-Nazis and like-minded individuals and disseminating that private information to the public and employers to discourage people from joining their ranks. Is antifa violent? Members pointedly do not eschew violence but rather see themselves as engaging in ""self-defense,"" protecting other protesters and primarily confronting neo-Nazis and white supremacists to deny them a platform to publicly spread their views. ""We are unapologetic about the reality that fighting fascism at points requires physical militancy,” Rose City Antifa’s Facebook page reads. “Anti-fascism is, by nature, a form of self-defense: the goal of fascism is to exterminate the vast majority of human beings.” Political activist and author Cornel West, speaking to Amy Goodman on the program Democracy Now about the clashes in Charlottesville, said antifa intervened when the ""neofascists"" move against his group of protesters. ""We would have been crushed like cockroaches if it were not for the anarchists and the anti-fascists,"" he said. Bray says the rise of fascism in the 1930s demonstrates that it was a mistake to allow such groups to air their views in hopes that public opinion would blunt their growth. ""We should be wary of those who are more distressed about alleged violations of the speech of fascists than the actual violence they perpetrate,"" he says. Where has the movement demonstrated? In addition to Charlottesville, antifa forces, who often dress in black and wear masks, have confronted or clashed with far-right groups in such places as the University of California at Berkeley, where protests by West Coast antifa forces, some of whom smashed windows and set fires, forced the cancellation of a speech by alt-right activist Milo Yiannopoulos in February and another by conservative commentator Ann Coulter in April. In June, antifa forces turned out to protest a pro-Trump free-speech in Portland. Some antifa counterprotesters began throwing objects at police, who responded with flash grenades and pepper balls, according to the The Oregonian. Antifa was also out in force in June to confront Patriot Prayer, a free speech group protesting “political correctness and hatred” at Evergreen State College in Olympia, Wash.",0.0
1622430826,2020-06-01 12:00:19,Restaurant owner whose business burned calls for justice for George Floyd,https://whyy.org/npr_story_post/restaurant-owner-whose-business-burned-calls-for-justice-for-george-floyd/,en,False,,82303,whyy.org,http://whyy.org/#spider,"On the south side of Minneapolis over the weekend, Safia Munye and her family walk up to the door of what was Mama Safia’s Kitchen. A volunteer from the neighborhood walks out onto Lake Street. “Is this your business?” she asks. Safia and her daughter Saida Hassan nod silently. “I’m sorry,” the woman says. It’s the first time they’ve seen it since fiery protests erupted in cries for racial justice and state troopers in riot gear blocked the road to this street. The walls are charred black, the kitchen reduced to rubble. Glass and water are swimming in puddles as community members around them work to sweep away the destruction. Safia looks around stunned. Hers is one of hundreds of businesses damaged or destroyed in protests Thursday and Friday night. “Alhamdulillah,” she repeats quietly. Praise God. “Everyone is safe.” “My heart is broken. My mind is broken,” she says. “I know I can’t come back from this. But this can be replaced. George’s life cannot. George’s life was more important. That man that got killed in the most inhumane way. I hope he gets justice.” George Floyd is the African American man who died after a white police officer pinned his neck to the ground with his knee last Monday for several minutes. Protests started in Minneapolis early last week and quickly spread across the country. Floyd’s pleading words to the officer, “I can’t breathe,” are now a rallying cry for people protesting the many black people who have died in police custody. Safia, a Somali immigrant, opened the restaurant in December 2018 with her retirement savings. In the midst of the coronavirus pandemic she closed the restaurant and had to choose between paying for insurance and paying staff. So Safia chose her staff. That means there were no funds to rebuild. A GoFundMe page was set up to help the family. This weekend she had planned to reopen as the city started easing stay-at-home orders. She spent over $4,000 on groceries and cleanup. Now that plan is gone. “It’s not just me,” she says. “It’s all of Lake Street, all of Minneapolis.” Her daughter Saida nods. “This is a city in pain,” Saida says. Across the street a row of restaurants — all locally owned, black and immigrant-owned — are all gone. But the library is OK. In the rubble, Saida finds the sign she made for her mother when the restaurant first opened. Against the black ash the wood plaque is pristine. It reads “Mama Safia’s Kitchen. Seasoned with Love.” “Because she always cooks with love,” Saida says. She pulls a few more knickknacks that haven’t burned. “Most of the artifacts here, I got them from Africa,” she says. “This one is from Somalia.” She puts them into a tiny pile of what is salvageable. Outside is a tower of all that is lost. Her sister Bibi Abdullah walks in to help. She finds prayer rugs in the banquet room her mom would rent out for small wedding dinners and religious holidays. “We can still use these,” she says. “We just have to wash them.” She searches for more things she can save. “The truth is things like this happen when people feel powerless. Something has to change,” Bibi says. Her voice catches. Her body seems to vibrate with a mix of anger and sadness. She says she hopes that these demonstrations translate to voters at the polls come November. “It came to this because we have people that do not care in positions of power and it should not be that way,” Bibi says. She and her sister start to clear the big debris together. Then Saida leads her mother, Safia, to the kitchen in the back so they can assess the damage. It’s a tunnel of charred walls, ash and debris. Safia gets upset and pulls away, speaking to her daughter in Somali. “I’m sorry, I’m sorry,” Saida responds in English as her mother walks out. “She’s just saying, ‘Why are you bringing me in here? I don’t want to see this,’ ” Saida says. Saida gets quiet. She stands in the kitchen alone for a moment, staring at the charred walls. Then she joins her family outside where dozens of Minneapolis residents from across the city are working in groups to clear the rubble. With everything unfolding, the pandemic has slipped many people’s minds. “I forgot. Have you seen me shake hands with people?” Saida shakes her head. “2020, we hear you, we see you. We went from one crisis to the next. What’s next?” Saida spends every night protesting, but also trying to protect other locally owned stores and restaurants. At night she cries herself to sleep. She understands the anger and desperation that are leading some to destroy buildings. “I’m like emotionally torn,” Saida says. She doesn’t want destruction. “But at the same time, people are crying for help. People are saying, ‘Fix this.’ ” She says she hopes, from all of this pain, finally there will be change.",0.0

Smoke continued to waft in the air 24 hours after people protesting the death of George Floyd lit fire to Moore's storefront, and several others along Lake Street. ""My business burned down two days ago, you see the flames? It's still going,"" Moore, 41, said Sunday. ""That flame down in people's soul? It's still going. They want justice."" She is among dozens of Minneapolis and St. Paul business owners, small and large, trying to rebuild after fiery riots and demonstrations in the Twin Cities on Thursday and Friday. Her company, ""Levels,"" which also has a St. Paul location that remains undamaged, was Moore's ""baby."" Moore, a black woman, said she started the business from the trunk of her car once she left a job with Minneapolis Public Schools in 2011 to pursue her passion for fashion and music. It had been opened for five years before people broke in Friday and started a fire that destroyed her business and several adjacent stores. When she was alerted to the break-in, Moore went to Lake Street and watched nearly a decade of work collapse into the concrete. ""I'm hurt that I lost this. But ... I can't cry right now,"" she said. ""I can't go home and cry and be hurt because I lost businesses. George Floyd lost his life. He'll never be here again."" She's confident she can recover but isn't sure if she can rebuild at the same location — in the heart of a diverse southside neighborhood. A GoFundMe has been started to help with those expenses. Other small businesses face similar uncertainty, but several fundraisers have been started to help support Minneapolis' littlest companies. As looters ransacked his St. Paul store, this business owner hid in the bathroom and whispered to 911 In St. Paul's Midway neighborhood, just blocks from where Moore's second Levels location was protected by armed men standing on its porch, one business owner said he hid in his office as people ransacked, urinated in and damaged the building. Jim Segal closed Ax-Man Surplus earlier than normal Thursday afternoon because daylight looting took hold at the nearby intersection of University and Snelling avenues. After sending customers and employees home and locking the front door, Segal said he continued to work in the office of the six-decade-old company. Then he heard multiple glass windows break. ""Luckily, I have a steel door because they were trying to enter the office,"" said Segal, who bought the surplus store about 20 years ago. ""I don't think they knew anybody was in there, but I basically barricaded myself within a bathroom inside the office."" He felt as if he were in a movie, the St. Paul native said. As display cases were shattered and electronics taken from inside his store, he whispered to 911 dispatch asking for help. ""Police said, 'Don't even bother boarding up your store,'"" Segal said Saturday. ""'There's a 50/50 chance it won't be here tomorrow."" About 6:30 p.m. Thursday, he returned to the St. Paul Ax-Man location, one of three in the metro, in an unsuccessful effort to shoo away people running in and out of his store. A company agreed to board up his windows, Segal said, but left quickly after arriving, not wanting to work amongst the crowd. He tried to get a license plate of someone stealing, but others tried to take his phone so he retreated to his car. Segal sat in his vehicle for hours as rioters peed in his store and took items ranging from knick-knacks and DVDs to a snow-blower. He said coronavirus concerns forced him to close his business for the better part of two months. They'd been reopened a little more than a week when the building was ransacked. ""I don't recall ever being in a situation where I was that panicked. I was petrified, actually,"" he said. Ax-Man won't reopen for at least a week or two, and Segal fears it may close permanently because of the lack of sales during the spring. That would mean a loss of livelihood for him and about 10 employees. He sympathizes with those upset about Floyd's death in police custody on Memorial Day, describing the video of Minneapolis police officers' actions ""horrific."" ""This is just stuff, no comparison (to a person dying),"" said Segal, a white man. ""But what I'm disappointed about is the lack of leadership in the government — Mayor (Melvin) Carter, Mayor (Jacob) Frey, Gov. (Tim) Walz — to just allow lawlessness. ""Indefensible what happened to Mr. Floyd, but this doesn't make it better. And I don't know what does."" Insurance helps small business owners, but a full recovery is 'a lot more complicated' While Moore and Segal both said they are insured, they don't believe insurance alone will enough to replace everything they've lost. People typically see business owner and think ""wealth,"" Segal said. ""That's not true for me,"" he said. ""I'm the last one to get paid."" Understanding insurance policies can be difficult for many small business owners, said Allison Sharkey, executive director of the Lake Street Council, which supports local companies. Lake Street has always been an area for Minneapolis's immigrant entrepreneurs to start businesses, she said, and many of those folks may not be familiar with aid systems or insurance proceedings. ""There's a lot of detail to go through in your contract that most people don't really understand until a situation like this happens,"" Sharkey said. ""It's a lot more complicated than just paying a $500 deductible and thinking the rest is going to be covered."" Minority business owners may not have the credit or assets to withstand closures as long as white business owners with more resources, she said. The council, and other metro business associations like it, try to fill that gap and provide guidance, but insurance claims won't stop some businesses from completely fading away. For Moore, she's frustrated when people bring up the fact she's insured because it ignores the work she put into the building and the items she won't get back. ""When you get it out the mud — meaning when you get it on your own, no handouts ... someone just handing you money doesn't equate,"" she said. ""It's deeper than that."" Financial support is coming for Twin Cities small businesses left in rubble amid George Floyd protests When Segal returned to his business Friday, he found a person who lived nearby sweeping glass from the sidewalk, which raised his spirits. Monetary support has begun, too. It's especially vital, small business advocates say, because many companies were already running out of money because of closures due to COVID-19. The Lake Street Council has received over $1.5 million to help support the hundreds of businesses that line the heavily damaged area. Sharkey said companies owned by people of color and immigrants have been especially affected by the days of unrest. Several ""big, beautiful"" buildings on the southside have been replaced by rubble, which will be eventually replaced by vacant lots. ""($1.5 million) sounds like a big number, but we're gonna need a lot more government and nonprofit support,"" Sharkey said. ""We have a long road ahead of us."" She said her organization had already begun to save money to distribute to companies dealing with financial contractions from the coronavirus, but it's not been shifted to riot recovery. The council will request an aid package from the state, but Sharkey thinks they'll need federal dollars as well. ""We're headed toward a recession,"" she said. ""We're really going to have to create a long-term strategy along with stakeholders, business owners, property owners business groups, elected officials."" Donations to that fund can be made here. Fundraising has begun in Segal's area, as well. The Hamline Midway Coalition has received more than $75,000 to help aid small businesses in their recovery from property damage and lost sales. Kate Mudge, the coalition's director, said the organization has been raising funds to help small and minority business owners worried about gentrification and corporatization coming with the new U.S. soccer stadium built nearby. ""We already have been dealing with a pandemic, we've been dealing with some long-term issues in our community, and this is the icing on the cake. We hope that this is gonna bring new people to Midway, new businesses,"" she said. ""We've dealt with worse."" Donations to the Midway fund can be made at here. Despite the uncertainty, the organizations are confident many businesses will survive if community support keeps up. ""I'm not blaming people, you can't judge anybody's pain or anger. Everyone acts and reacts to things in different ways,"" Moore said. ""I have a black-owned business, it was burned down and we were protesting, for a black man's life that was taken. So, I was just a little confused on where we're going with this. But, at the end of the day, everything is about sacrifices.""",0.0

Most demonstrations, some attracting hundreds of people, were peaceful though violence, including the burning of police vehicles and looting, prompted police in some cities to deploy tear gas to gain control of the crowd. Early in the day, volunteers turned out in many cities to sweep up debris from businesses that had been burned, had their windows broken or were otherwise damaged Saturday. Here's a look at how protests are unfolding around the country on Sunday: Washington, D.C.: Historic St. John's Church near White House set ablaze As protesters gathered near the White House, flames were seen at the Washington, D.C., landmark that bills itself as ""the church of the presidents."" The fire, apparently an act of arson, was in the basement of St. John's Church, across from the White House, The Washington Post reported, and was extinguished. It occurred as a demonstration was taking place outside. The gathering had attracted as many as 1,000 Sunday, who faced off against officers in riot gear. The Episcopalian church in Lafayette Square boasts on its website that every U.S. president since James Madison has attended services there. Consecrated in 1816, the church also says the bell in its steeple, weighing almost 1,000 pounds, was cast in 1822 by Paul Revere's son Joseph. New York City: Protesters force closure of Manhattan Bridge; street fires, looting A crucial bridge into Manhattan was closed Sunday to make way for protesters, a day after hundreds of arrests including the mayor's daughter, it was reported. Street fires were being set and sporadic looting was reported Sunday evening after a day that saw large groups of protesters walk from Brooklyn to Manhattan over the Manhattan Bridge, which had to be closed, ABC7 in New York reported. Mayor Bill de Blasio's daughter Chiara, 25, was among 345 arrested, the station reported based on unnamed NYPD sources. The Daily Mail said it was able to confirm the arrest from a police report. She was reportedly arrested as part of a group of 100 demonstrators who refused to leave a roadway when ordered by police. Seattle: National Guard called to Bellevue; protesters block Interstate 5 National Guard troops were ordered to the Seattle suburb of Bellevue after reports of widespread looting. Washington Gov. Jay Inslee ordered 200 National Guard members to Bellevue after the mayor declared an emergency due to violence. Rioters broke into the Bellevue Mall and were stealing goods from stores. The thefts were part of a day of protests in the Seattle area that included shutting down Interstate 5, the same freeway that San Diego demonstrators blocked more than 1,000 miles away in southern California. Chicago: Gov. JB Pritzker activates National Guardsmen to assist police Vandalism reports continued to crop up in several city neighborhoods and some suburbs. The communities of Tinley Park, Crestwood and Oak Lawn alerted residents to stay home due to civil unrest. Many businesses boarded up. Gov. J.B. Pritzker said he activated 375 Illinois National Guard soldiers to assist local law enforcement with street closures. The downtown Chicago demonstrations that drew thousands started peacefully Saturday afternoon in a plaza, with protesters reading the names of black people who have died at the hands of police. But that gave way to violence and destruction that continued overnight Sunday in Chicago and elsewhere. Police used batons to beat back demonstrators as police cars were set ablaze and windows were smashed at businesses ranging from neighborhood convenience stores to high-end Michigan Avenue shops. Santa Monica, California: Unchecked looting as marchers confront police Looters took advantage of a large demonstration several blocks away to hit stores in the city's business district. In late afternoon, police were met with resistance when they tried to end a demonstration that had been peaceful. Demonstrators constructed a makeshift barricade in the middle of a street to protect themselves from non-lethal rounds fired by officers. The march had attracted hundreds along the city's main oceanfront boulevard. Though there were many police officers present for the march, looters were able to plunder stores with few to stop them. Cars were seen pulling up in front of stores, with looters running in to collect bundles of clothes and other merchandise, then running out. Boxes littered the sidewalk as thieves were seen transferring goods into plastic trash bags. A 5:30 p.m. PST curfew was announced due to the protests. The looting came despite the arrival of the National Guard troops in neighboring Los Angeles, which had seen extensive looting, vandalism and arson on Saturday. Murfreesboro, Tennessee: Brick thrown into business, police use tear gas A small but tense demonstration in Murfreesboro, Tennessee, appeared to have dispersed after demonstrators blocked traffic and threw a brick through the window of a local business, prompting police to respond with canisters of tear gas. About 50 protesters, many of whom appeared to be Middle Tennessee State University students, marched from Main Street toward Forrest Hall, a campus building named for Confederate general and Ku Klux Klan founder Nathan Bedford Forrest. Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee said protests in Murfreesboro are now “overt threats to public safety and property.” Police said an armored vehicle was vandalized and protesters have blocked traffic by lying in the street in an intersection. Officers responded by throwing canisters of tear gas to drive protesters out of the street. However, before the protest escalated, negotiations between police and protest leaders led to calm, then students and officers were seen walking together and posing for photos. – Nancy DeGennaro, Joseph Spears, Mealand Ragland-Hudgins and Brinley Hineman, Murfreesboro Daily News Journal Savannah, Georgia: Protesters chant 'Arrest the other three' during rally Thousands demonstrated against racism and the killings of black people at the hands of police Sunday in Savannah, Georgia. City leaders joined protesters who peacefully marched from Johnson Square to City Hall. “We need to make sure that we stop apologizing and we move from apology to action,” Savannah Police Chief Roy Minter said. At one point during Mayor Van Johnson’s speech, the crowd broke into a chant of “arrest the other three,” referring to other Minneapolis police officers who stood by while an officer knelt on Floyd’s neck. “Yeah, they should arrest the other three,” Johnson said. “We are tired of the mess and we want it to stop now. We stand here as a united community to say that we are standing with George Floyd and his family, because no man should ever have to die like that,” Johnson said. “We stand here united as a community to say that crooked police officers are called criminals. And in jail, they should be.” – Will Peebles, Dennis Knight, Mary Landers, Nathan Dominitz and Zach Dennis, Savannah Morning News San Diego: Police fire tear gas after being assaulted by rocks and bottles San Diego Police said they fired tear gas canisters Sunday after rocks and bottles were thrown at them. The department said in a series of tweets that the confrontation was taking place at Second Avenue and Broadway in the seaside city's downtown. ""Certain protestors continue to throw objects and vandalize our city,"" the department said in one post. ""The criminal behavior of these few is unacceptable. We are continuing to order the crowd to disperse."" Earlier, however, the department praised the peacefulness of most demonstrators. But it said it had to issue the order to disperse because of the dangerous actions of a few. At one point, demonstrators occupied Interstate 5, stopping traffic in both directions, the San Diego Union-Tribune reported. Philadelphia: Mayor Jim Kenney 'saddened and disappointed' beyond words Another day of street protests gave way to looting, with at least one police vehicle set on fire. Looters were running out of stores in the northeastern section of the city with armloads of merchandise. In the downtown, workers and volunteers swept up broken glass from windows shattered during riots the previous day. Graffiti was being removed. Mayor Jim Kenney said the mayhem “saddened and disappointed me beyond words, and I’m sure it saddened every Philadelphian who takes pride in their city.” He said those responsible “not only desecrated private businesses, they also desecrated the important message that was heard in the earlier peaceful protests.” Spartanburg, South Carolina: Passing motorists show support for protesters Chanting “No justice, no peace,” about 100 peaceful Spartanburg, South Carolina, protesters gathered at Barnet Park, drawing support from motorists who honked their car horns. “We want to take a peaceful stand to show support,” said organizer Kelvin Brown. “If we can all come together as a people, black and white, we can make a difference.” Many protesters said it wasn’t just Floyd’s death at the hand of a white police officer, or that it took days before the officer was arrested, that triggered anger. “We need to end the racist system,” said Curtis Pickens. “If you want all this to stop, real justice is what is needed. Stop the racial and social profiling. Stop hiring white supremacist officers.” “It’s time to stand up for what we believe in,” Isaiah Jordan said. “What happened to George Floyd terrorizes the whole nation. We’ve got to do something about it. I’m just sick and tired of young, black men dying."" --Bob Montgomery, GoUpstate.com Lafayette, Louisiana: Protesters want police to know 'we're human' Hundreds of protesters, some wearing protective face coverings, lined Lafayette streets to join a peaceful demonstration against police brutality. The protest, peaceful like others in Baton Rouge and New Orleans this weekend, began in the morning with protesters lining the streets to chant. “I am sick and tired of being sick and tired,” Lafayette NAACP President Marja Broussard said to protesters. “I have a message for law enforcement. The message is: we want you to know that we’re human just like you...We want you to know we have families. We’re human.” – William Taylor Potter, Lafayette Daily Advertiser Augusta, Georgia: Demonstrators chant 'No justice, no peace' Demonstrators chanted “no justice, no peace” as they walked along Washington Road in Augusta, Georgia. While “No justice, no peace,” was a popular chant among protesters, Sunday’s peaceful march was about showing strength through peace rather than through violence, organizers said. Latoya Lovett said she asked the Street Justice Council to help her organize the marches after hearing many Augusta residents talk about going to Atlanta to join protests there, which have turned violent after peaceful starts. “You can march in your own city, you can have a voice in your own city,” Lovett said. “You don’t have to go smash windows, you don’t have to go beat people, you don’t have to drop on the police.” Demonstrators were escorted by Richmond County Sheriff’s Office deputies who blocked off roads and intersections as needed. Sheriff Richard Roundtree was among those who helped guide the marchers and ensure safety for both them and the motorists. “We believe in free speech and protesting and voicing your opinion, as long as you do it in a safe manner,” Roundtree said. “As long as you’re doing that, we’re all for it.” – Will Cheney and Miguel Legoas, The Augusta Chronicle Jacksonville, Florida: Peaceful rally follows violent Saturday night of protests A peaceful demonstration was held Sunday outside the Duval County Courthouse. Then protesters started moving downtown and Jacksonville, Florida, police worked to keep them in certain areas. The cleanup of smashed store windows began Sunday around Florida after a night of unrest throughout the state’s cities. Jacksonville Sheriff Mike Williams said an unnamed deputy was either stabbed or slashed in the neck and was taken to a hospital for treatment Saturday night. A sheriff’s office spokeswoman would not comment on the deputy’s condition Sunday morning. A protest Saturday resulted in many arrests, “but we still don’t know how many or anything related to those arrests,” the sheriff said. – Sarasota News-Tribune Cincinnati: Police make 100 arrests after urging protesters to go home Police arrested as many as 100 people after using tear gas and imploring the crowd to go home ahead of a curfew. It ended a day that earlier featured a large crowd gathered at Inwood Park in Cincinnati to hear speakers as a rally, followed by a march. Organizers gave instructions about what to do if they are tear-gassed. The rally started with a fist-up salute and a song about the death Sam DuBose, shot by a police officer not far from the scene of this protest in 2015. Some Cincinnati City Council members tweeted from the rally. – Sarah Brookbank, Cincinnati Enquirer Contributing: The Associated Press",0.0

The protests over George Floyd's death hit the nation's capital Friday night as angry protesters arrived at Pennsylvania Avenue, leading to a lockdown at the White House. Outside the White House on Friday, Secret Service could be seen after 7 p.m. taking at least one person into custody. Videos showed a large group of protesters gathering, with some burning flags and knocking over barricades. There were also some violent encounters. The president remained there about an hour before returning to the residence, according to a Republican close to the White House and an administration official who spoke to the Associated Press on the condition of anonymity. It is currently unknown whether first lady Melania Trump and their son, Barron, were with the president but the family has been shaken by the size and venom of the crowds, AP reported. ""The White House does not comment on security protocols and decisions,” said White House spokesman Judd Deere. The Secret Service said it does not discuss the means and methods of its protective operations. Officials told The New York Times, which first reported the story, they never believed Trump was in danger but took the precaution of moving him to the bunker as tensions escalated. Trump has told advisers he worries about his safety, while both privately and publicly praising the work of the Secret Service, according to the AP. Floyd, an unarmed black man, died in Minneapolis police custody this week after a white officer pinned him to the ground under his knee. His death has sparked demonstrations against police brutality and racial discrimination in cities across the United States. Trump praised the Secret Service and said he “watched every move” from inside the White House during Friday's protest and that he “couldn't have felt more safe.” ""They let the ‘protesters’ scream & rant as much as they wanted, but whenever someone got too frisky or out of line, they would quickly come down on them, hard – didn’t know what hit them,"" he said Saturday. Trump continued, ""The front line was replaced with fresh agents, like magic. Big crowd, professionally organized, but nobody came close to breaching the fence. If they had, they would have been greeted with the most vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons, I have ever seen. That’s when people would have been really badly hurt, at least."" He also claimed DC Mayor Muriel Bowser didn't allow DC police to ""get involved"" and assist Secret Service, though Secret Service later said they were on the scene. Bowser, a Democrat, said on Twitter the city's police department would protect everyone regardless of whether the mayor agreed with them. ""While he hides behind his fence afraid/alone, I stand w/ people peacefully exercising their First Amendment Right after the murder of #GeorgeFloyd & hundreds of years of institutional racism There are no vicious dogs & ominous weapons. There is just a scared man,"" she wrote. This is the same bunker Vice President Dick Cheney was brought after the September 11 attacks when authorities feared a hijacked plane hijacked was heading toward the White House. President George W. Bush, when he returned to D.C. later that evening, was later taken there after a false alarm of another plane. The recent protests have led to one of the highest alerts at the White House complex since those attacks.",0.0

More than 4,400 arrests have been made at protests nationwide since viral video emerged showing former Minneapolis Officer Derek Chauvin holding his knee to Floyd's neck for more than eight minutes on Memorial Day, resulting in Floyd's death. Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo apologized to Floyd's family Sunday, saying that firing Chauvin and the other three officers involved in the incident was the right thing to do. Peaceful protests continued to be marred by violence. The Minneapolis Department of Public safety confirmed a semi-truck drove into a group of peaceful protesters on Interstate 35. The driver of the truck was taken into custody, but not before protesters pulled him from the truck's cab. The driver was taken to the hospital with minor injuries. Elsewhere, vandalism and looting continued across the country, as did the use of tear gas and rubber bullets by police in confrontations with protesters. Reports: President Trump hustled to bunker amid Washington protests President Donald Trump was briefly moved to the White House's underground bunker Friday night to shelter in place as the protest grew outside the Executive Mansion, according to multiple outlets. The protests over George Floyd's death hit the nation's capital Friday night as angry protesters arrived at Pennsylvania Avenue, leading to a lockdown at the White House. Dozens of Secret Service agents were injured in clashes with protesters over the weekend, and videos showed a large group of protesters – some burning flags and knocking over barricades.

Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said she saw a video, which she called ""disturbing,"" of five officers pulling two college students out of a car downtown. Bottoms and police Chief Erika Shields made the announcement at a press conference after reviewing body-camera footage. ""We understand that our officers are working very long hours under an enormous amount of stress,"" Bottoms said. ""But we also understand that the use of excessive force is never acceptable."" – Jessica Flores At least 4,400 arrests since George Floyd's death: AP data At least 4,400 people nationwide have been arrested over days of protests since George Floyd’s death on Memorial Day, according to a tally compiled by The Associated Press. About 150 people were arrested in Minnesota after violating curfew amid protests Sunday night, the Minnesota Department of Public Safety tweeted. DPS continued to tweet about arrests late into the night and added, ""Even peaceful protesters who are breaking curfew are subject to arrest. Please go home and stay there."" DPS announced the arrests of more than 155 people Saturday night across multiple agencies. A dozen firearms were confiscated between the State Patrol and the Minneapolis Police Department.

""Please stay safe, and stay home."" Minneapolis police chief: George Floyd's death 'a violation of humanity' Minneapolis Police Department Chief Medaria Arradondo told CNN that George Floyd's death was ""a violation of humanity."" Speaking at the site where Floyd died after fired police officer Derek Chauvin held his knee to Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes, Arradondo apologized to Floyd's family and said he had a ""visceral"" and ""emotional"" reaction to the video that has sparked outrage across the nation. “There are absolute truths in life,"" Arradondo told CNN. ""We need air to breathe. ... I did not need days or weeks or months or processes or bureaucracies to tell me what occurred out here last Monday, it was wrong.” When asked why he fired the four officers involved in the incident that led to Floyd's death, Arradondo said: ""In my mind, this was a violation of humanity. This was a violation of the oath the majority of the men and women that put this uniform on — this goes absolutely against it. This goes contrary to what we believe in.""

In the video, the people vandalize three police vehicles, smashing windows and hitting and kicking the vehicles. One of the people opens a door to the SUV and those at the scene start lighting things inside of it on fire. Police eventually got to the scene and began pushing back protesters as the vehicles burned behind them. Minnesota AG Keith Ellison to lead prosecution of Derek Chauvin Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz announced Sunday that state Attorney General Keith Ellison will lead the prosecution in the Floyd case. Ellison called the case “unusual because of the way that Mr. Floyd was killed and who did it — at the hands of the defendant who was a Minneapolis police officer.” He said he expects to work together with Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman on the case. Ellison didn’t announce additional charges for Chauvin or charges for the three other officers involved in the incident. He added “prosecuting police officers for misconduct, including homicide and murder, is very difficult.” “Every single link in the prosecutorial chain will come under attack as we present this case to a jury or a fact finder and we need to make sure that we be absolutely prepared. We intend to be absolutely prepared.”",0.0

Smoke continued to waft in the air 24 hours after people protesting the death of George Floyd lit fire to Moore's storefront, and several others along Lake Street. ""My business burned down two days ago, you see the flames? It's still going,"" Moore, 41, said Sunday. ""That flame down in people's soul? It's still going. They want justice."" She is among dozens of Minneapolis and St. Paul business owners, small and large, trying to rebuild after fiery riots and demonstrations in the Twin Cities on Thursday and Friday. Her company, ""Levels,"" which also has a St. Paul location that remains undamaged, was Moore's ""baby."" Moore, a black woman, said she started the business from the trunk of her car once she left a job with Minneapolis Public Schools in 2011 to pursue her passion for fashion and music. It had been opened for five years before people broke in Friday and started a fire that destroyed her business and several adjacent stores. When she was alerted to the break-in, Moore went to Lake Street and watched nearly a decade of work collapse into the concrete. ""I'm hurt that I lost this. But ... I can't cry right now,"" she said. ""I can't go home and cry and be hurt because I lost businesses. George Floyd lost his life. He'll never be here again."" She's confident she can recover but isn't sure if she can rebuild at the same location — in the heart of a diverse southside neighborhood. A GoFundMe has been started to help with those expenses. Other small businesses face similar uncertainty, but several fundraisers have been started to help support Minneapolis' littlest companies. As looters ransacked his St. Paul store, this business owner hid in the bathroom and whispered to 911 In St. Paul's Midway neighborhood, just blocks from where Moore's second Levels location was protected by armed men standing on its porch, one business owner said he hid in his office as people ransacked, urinated in and damaged the building. Jim Segal closed Ax-Man Surplus earlier than normal Thursday afternoon because daylight looting took hold at the nearby intersection of University and Snelling avenues. After sending customers and employees home and locking the front door, Segal said he continued to work in the office of the six-decade-old company. Then he heard multiple glass windows break. ""Luckily, I have a steel door because they were trying to enter the office,"" said Segal, who bought the surplus store about 20 years ago. ""I don't think they knew anybody was in there, but I basically barricaded myself within a bathroom inside the office."" He felt as if he were in a movie, the St. Paul native said. As display cases were shattered and electronics taken from inside his store, he whispered to 911 dispatch asking for help. ""Police said, 'Don't even bother boarding up your store,'"" Segal said Saturday. ""'There's a 50/50 chance it won't be here tomorrow."" About 6:30 p.m. Thursday, he returned to the St. Paul Ax-Man location, one of three in the metro, in an unsuccessful effort to shoo away people running in and out of his store. A company agreed to board up his windows, Segal said, but left quickly after arriving, not wanting to work amongst the crowd. He tried to get a license plate of someone stealing, but others tried to take his phone so he retreated to his car. Segal sat in his vehicle for hours as rioters peed in his store and took items ranging from knick-knacks and DVDs to a snow-blower. He said coronavirus concerns forced him to close his business for the better part of two months. They'd been reopened a little more than a week when the building was ransacked. ""I don't recall ever being in a situation where I was that panicked. I was petrified, actually,"" he said. Ax-Man won't reopen for at least a week or two, and Segal fears it may close permanently because of the lack of sales during the spring. That would mean a loss of livelihood for him and about 10 employees. He sympathizes with those upset about Floyd's death in police custody on Memorial Day, describing the video of Minneapolis police officers' actions ""horrific."" ""This is just stuff, no comparison (to a person dying),"" said Segal, a white man. ""But what I'm disappointed about is the lack of leadership in the government — Mayor (Melvin) Carter, Mayor (Jacob) Frey, Gov. (Tim) Walz — to just allow lawlessness. ""Indefensible what happened to Mr. Floyd, but this doesn't make it better. And I don't know what does."" Insurance helps small business owners, but a full recovery is 'a lot more complicated' While Moore and Segal both said they are insured, they don't believe insurance alone will enough to replace everything they've lost. People typically see business owner and think ""wealth,"" Segal said. ""That's not true for me,"" he said. ""I'm the last one to get paid."" Understanding insurance policies can be difficult for many small business owners, said Allison Sharkey, executive director of the Lake Street Council, which supports local companies. Lake Street has always been an area for Minneapolis's immigrant entrepreneurs to start businesses, she said, and many of those folks may not be familiar with aid systems or insurance proceedings. ""There's a lot of detail to go through in your contract that most people don't really understand until a situation like this happens,"" Sharkey said. ""It's a lot more complicated than just paying a $500 deductible and thinking the rest is going to be covered."" Minority business owners may not have the credit or assets to withstand closures as long as white business owners with more resources, she said. The council, and other metro business associations like it, try to fill that gap and provide guidance, but insurance claims won't stop some businesses from completely fading away. For Moore, she's frustrated when people bring up the fact she's insured because it ignores the work she put into the building and the items she won't get back. ""When you get it out the mud — meaning when you get it on your own, no handouts ... someone just handing you money doesn't equate,"" she said. ""It's deeper than that."" Financial support is coming for Twin Cities small businesses left in rubble amid George Floyd protests When Segal returned to his business Friday, he found a person who lived nearby sweeping glass from the sidewalk, which raised his spirits. Monetary support has begun, too. It's especially vital, small business advocates say, because many companies were already running out of money because of closures due to COVID-19. The Lake Street Council has received over $1.5 million to help support the hundreds of businesses that line the heavily damaged area. Sharkey said companies owned by people of color and immigrants have been especially affected by the days of unrest. Several ""big, beautiful"" buildings on the southside have been replaced by rubble, which will be eventually replaced by vacant lots. ""($1.5 million) sounds like a big number, but we're gonna need a lot more government and nonprofit support,"" Sharkey said. ""We have a long road ahead of us."" She said her organization had already begun to save money to distribute to companies dealing with financial contractions from the coronavirus, but it's not been shifted to riot recovery. The council will request an aid package from the state, but Sharkey thinks they'll need federal dollars as well. ""We're headed toward a recession,"" she said. ""We're really going to have to create a long-term strategy along with stakeholders, business owners, property owners business groups, elected officials."" Donations to that fund can be made here. Fundraising has begun in Segal's area, as well. The Hamline Midway Coalition has received more than $75,000 to help aid small businesses in their recovery from property damage and lost sales. Kate Mudge, the coalition's director, said the organization has been raising funds to help small and minority business owners worried about gentrification and corporatization coming with the new U.S. soccer stadium built nearby. ""We already have been dealing with a pandemic, we've been dealing with some long-term issues in our community, and this is the icing on the cake. We hope that this is gonna bring new people to Midway, new businesses,"" she said. ""We've dealt with worse."" Donations to the Midway fund can be made at here. Despite the uncertainty, the organizations are confident many businesses will survive if community support keeps up. ""I'm not blaming people, you can't judge anybody's pain or anger. Everyone acts and reacts to things in different ways,"" Moore said. ""I have a black-owned business, it was burned down and we were protesting, for a black man's life that was taken. So, I was just a little confused on where we're going with this. But, at the end of the day, everything is about sacrifices.""",0.0

The movement has no unified structure or national leadership but has emerged in the form of local bodies nationwide, particularly on the West Coast. Some of the groups, such as the 10-year-old Rose City Antifa in Portland, the oldest antifa group in the U.S., are particularly well-organized and active online and on Facebook, while its members are individually anonymous. President Trump has singled out antifa as part of what he calls the alt-left in his initial claim that ""many sides"" were to blame for violence in Charlottesville the weekend of Aug. 12, not just the neo-Nazis, KKK and white nationalists. How is it pronounced? ""AN-tifa"" with the emphasis on the first syllable, which sounds more like ""on"" in English than ""an."" When did it start? Anti-fascist groups, particularly in Europe, have been around for many decades, notably in Italy, against Mussolini, and in Germany, against Hitler. In the postwar period, antifa groups resurged to fight neo-Nazi groups, particularly in Germany. In the U.S., the anti-fascist movements grew out of leftist politics of the late '80s, primarily under the umbrella of Anti-Racist Action. What does the movement want? The primary goal is to stop neo-Nazis and white supremacists from gaining a platform rather than to promote a specific antifa agenda. The antifa groups are decidedly anti-racist, anti-sexist and anti-homophobia, but also by and large socially leftist and anti-capitalist. How do the groups operate? Mark Bray, a lecturer and Dartmouth and author of the new book Antifa: The Antifascist Handbook, says the groups ""organize educational campaigns, build community coalitions, monitor fascists, pressure venues to cancel their events, organize self-defense trainings and physically confront the far right when necessary."" A main goal is to try to deny fascists a public forum, which is why they turn out in numbers to physically confront neo-Nazis, the KKK and white supremacists at public demonstrations. They also step in to protect counter-protesters at such events. In addition, antifa is particularly active in ""doxxing,"" or identifying neo-Nazis and like-minded individuals and disseminating that private information to the public and employers to discourage people from joining their ranks. Is antifa violent? Members pointedly do not eschew violence but rather see themselves as engaging in ""self-defense,"" protecting other protesters and primarily confronting neo-Nazis and white supremacists to deny them a platform to publicly spread their views. ""We are unapologetic about the reality that fighting fascism at points requires physical militancy,” Rose City Antifa’s Facebook page reads. “Anti-fascism is, by nature, a form of self-defense: the goal of fascism is to exterminate the vast majority of human beings.” Political activist and author Cornel West, speaking to Amy Goodman on the program Democracy Now about the clashes in Charlottesville, said antifa intervened when the ""neofascists"" move against his group of protesters. ""We would have been crushed like cockroaches if it were not for the anarchists and the anti-fascists,"" he said. Bray says the rise of fascism in the 1930s demonstrates that it was a mistake to allow such groups to air their views in hopes that public opinion would blunt their growth. ""We should be wary of those who are more distressed about alleged violations of the speech of fascists than the actual violence they perpetrate,"" he says. Where has the movement demonstrated? In addition to Charlottesville, antifa forces, who often dress in black and wear masks, have confronted or clashed with far-right groups in such places as the University of California at Berkeley, where protests by West Coast antifa forces, some of whom smashed windows and set fires, forced the cancellation of a speech by alt-right activist Milo Yiannopoulos in February and another by conservative commentator Ann Coulter in April. In June, antifa forces turned out to protest a pro-Trump free-speech in Portland. Some antifa counterprotesters began throwing objects at police, who responded with flash grenades and pepper balls, according to the The Oregonian. Antifa was also out in force in June to confront Patriot Prayer, a free speech group protesting “political correctness and hatred” at Evergreen State College in Olympia, Wash.",0.0

Most demonstrations, some attracting hundreds of people, were peaceful though violence, including the burning of police vehicles and looting, prompted police in some cities to deploy tear gas to gain control of the crowd. Early in the day, volunteers turned out in many cities to sweep up debris from businesses that had been burned, had their windows broken or were otherwise damaged Saturday. Here's a look at how protests are unfolding around the country on Sunday: Washington, D.C.: Historic St. John's Church near White House set ablaze As protesters gathered near the White House, flames were seen at the Washington, D.C., landmark that bills itself as ""the church of the presidents."" The fire, apparently an act of arson, was in the basement of St. John's Church, across from the White House, The Washington Post reported, and was extinguished. It occurred as a demonstration was taking place outside. The gathering had attracted as many as 1,000 Sunday, who faced off against officers in riot gear. The Episcopalian church in Lafayette Square boasts on its website that every U.S. president since James Madison has attended services there. Consecrated in 1816, the church also says the bell in its steeple, weighing almost 1,000 pounds, was cast in 1822 by Paul Revere's son Joseph. New York City: Protesters force closure of Manhattan Bridge; street fires, looting A crucial bridge into Manhattan was closed Sunday to make way for protesters, a day after hundreds of arrests including the mayor's daughter, it was reported. Street fires were being set and sporadic looting was reported Sunday evening after a day that saw large groups of protesters walk from Brooklyn to Manhattan over the Manhattan Bridge, which had to be closed, ABC7 in New York reported. Mayor Bill de Blasio's daughter Chiara, 25, was among 345 arrested, the station reported based on unnamed NYPD sources. The Daily Mail said it was able to confirm the arrest from a police report. She was reportedly arrested as part of a group of 100 demonstrators who refused to leave a roadway when ordered by police. Seattle: National Guard called to Bellevue; protesters block Interstate 5 National Guard troops were ordered to the Seattle suburb of Bellevue after reports of widespread looting. Washington Gov. Jay Inslee ordered 200 National Guard members to Bellevue after the mayor declared an emergency due to violence. Rioters broke into the Bellevue Mall and were stealing goods from stores. The thefts were part of a day of protests in the Seattle area that included shutting down Interstate 5, the same freeway that San Diego demonstrators blocked more than 1,000 miles away in southern California. Chicago: Gov. JB Pritzker activates National Guardsmen to assist police Vandalism reports continued to crop up in several city neighborhoods and some suburbs. The communities of Tinley Park, Crestwood and Oak Lawn alerted residents to stay home due to civil unrest. Many businesses boarded up. Gov. J.B. Pritzker said he activated 375 Illinois National Guard soldiers to assist local law enforcement with street closures. The downtown Chicago demonstrations that drew thousands started peacefully Saturday afternoon in a plaza, with protesters reading the names of black people who have died at the hands of police. But that gave way to violence and destruction that continued overnight Sunday in Chicago and elsewhere. Police used batons to beat back demonstrators as police cars were set ablaze and windows were smashed at businesses ranging from neighborhood convenience stores to high-end Michigan Avenue shops. Santa Monica, California: Unchecked looting as marchers confront police Looters took advantage of a large demonstration several blocks away to hit stores in the city's business district. In late afternoon, police were met with resistance when they tried to end a demonstration that had been peaceful. Demonstrators constructed a makeshift barricade in the middle of a street to protect themselves from non-lethal rounds fired by officers. The march had attracted hundreds along the city's main oceanfront boulevard. Though there were many police officers present for the march, looters were able to plunder stores with few to stop them. Cars were seen pulling up in front of stores, with looters running in to collect bundles of clothes and other merchandise, then running out. Boxes littered the sidewalk as thieves were seen transferring goods into plastic trash bags. A 5:30 p.m. PST curfew was announced due to the protests. The looting came despite the arrival of the National Guard troops in neighboring Los Angeles, which had seen extensive looting, vandalism and arson on Saturday. Murfreesboro, Tennessee: Brick thrown into business, police use tear gas A small but tense demonstration in Murfreesboro, Tennessee, appeared to have dispersed after demonstrators blocked traffic and threw a brick through the window of a local business, prompting police to respond with canisters of tear gas. About 50 protesters, many of whom appeared to be Middle Tennessee State University students, marched from Main Street toward Forrest Hall, a campus building named for Confederate general and Ku Klux Klan founder Nathan Bedford Forrest. Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee said protests in Murfreesboro are now “overt threats to public safety and property.” Police said an armored vehicle was vandalized and protesters have blocked traffic by lying in the street in an intersection. Officers responded by throwing canisters of tear gas to drive protesters out of the street. However, before the protest escalated, negotiations between police and protest leaders led to calm, then students and officers were seen walking together and posing for photos. – Nancy DeGennaro, Joseph Spears, Mealand Ragland-Hudgins and Brinley Hineman, Murfreesboro Daily News Journal Savannah, Georgia: Protesters chant 'Arrest the other three' during rally Thousands demonstrated against racism and the killings of black people at the hands of police Sunday in Savannah, Georgia. City leaders joined protesters who peacefully marched from Johnson Square to City Hall. “We need to make sure that we stop apologizing and we move from apology to action,” Savannah Police Chief Roy Minter said. At one point during Mayor Van Johnson’s speech, the crowd broke into a chant of “arrest the other three,” referring to other Minneapolis police officers who stood by while an officer knelt on Floyd’s neck. “Yeah, they should arrest the other three,” Johnson said. “We are tired of the mess and we want it to stop now. We stand here as a united community to say that we are standing with George Floyd and his family, because no man should ever have to die like that,” Johnson said. “We stand here united as a community to say that crooked police officers are called criminals. And in jail, they should be.” – Will Peebles, Dennis Knight, Mary Landers, Nathan Dominitz and Zach Dennis, Savannah Morning News San Diego: Police fire tear gas after being assaulted by rocks and bottles San Diego Police said they fired tear gas canisters Sunday after rocks and bottles were thrown at them. The department said in a series of tweets that the confrontation was taking place at Second Avenue and Broadway in the seaside city's downtown. ""Certain protestors continue to throw objects and vandalize our city,"" the department said in one post. ""The criminal behavior of these few is unacceptable. We are continuing to order the crowd to disperse."" Earlier, however, the department praised the peacefulness of most demonstrators. But it said it had to issue the order to disperse because of the dangerous actions of a few. At one point, demonstrators occupied Interstate 5, stopping traffic in both directions, the San Diego Union-Tribune reported. Philadelphia: Mayor Jim Kenney 'saddened and disappointed' beyond words Another day of street protests gave way to looting, with at least one police vehicle set on fire. Looters were running out of stores in the northeastern section of the city with armloads of merchandise. In the downtown, workers and volunteers swept up broken glass from windows shattered during riots the previous day. Graffiti was being removed. Mayor Jim Kenney said the mayhem “saddened and disappointed me beyond words, and I’m sure it saddened every Philadelphian who takes pride in their city.” He said those responsible “not only desecrated private businesses, they also desecrated the important message that was heard in the earlier peaceful protests.” Spartanburg, South Carolina: Passing motorists show support for protesters Chanting “No justice, no peace,” about 100 peaceful Spartanburg, South Carolina, protesters gathered at Barnet Park, drawing support from motorists who honked their car horns. “We want to take a peaceful stand to show support,” said organizer Kelvin Brown. “If we can all come together as a people, black and white, we can make a difference.” Many protesters said it wasn’t just Floyd’s death at the hand of a white police officer, or that it took days before the officer was arrested, that triggered anger. “We need to end the racist system,” said Curtis Pickens. “If you want all this to stop, real justice is what is needed. Stop the racial and social profiling. Stop hiring white supremacist officers.” “It’s time to stand up for what we believe in,” Isaiah Jordan said. “What happened to George Floyd terrorizes the whole nation. We’ve got to do something about it. I’m just sick and tired of young, black men dying."" --Bob Montgomery, GoUpstate.com Lafayette, Louisiana: Protesters want police to know 'we're human' Hundreds of protesters, some wearing protective face coverings, lined Lafayette streets to join a peaceful demonstration against police brutality. The protest, peaceful like others in Baton Rouge and New Orleans this weekend, began in the morning with protesters lining the streets to chant. “I am sick and tired of being sick and tired,” Lafayette NAACP President Marja Broussard said to protesters. “I have a message for law enforcement. The message is: we want you to know that we’re human just like you...We want you to know we have families. We’re human.” – William Taylor Potter, Lafayette Daily Advertiser Augusta, Georgia: Demonstrators chant 'No justice, no peace' Demonstrators chanted “no justice, no peace” as they walked along Washington Road in Augusta, Georgia. While “No justice, no peace,” was a popular chant among protesters, Sunday’s peaceful march was about showing strength through peace rather than through violence, organizers said. Latoya Lovett said she asked the Street Justice Council to help her organize the marches after hearing many Augusta residents talk about going to Atlanta to join protests there, which have turned violent after peaceful starts. “You can march in your own city, you can have a voice in your own city,” Lovett said. “You don’t have to go smash windows, you don’t have to go beat people, you don’t have to drop on the police.” Demonstrators were escorted by Richmond County Sheriff’s Office deputies who blocked off roads and intersections as needed. Sheriff Richard Roundtree was among those who helped guide the marchers and ensure safety for both them and the motorists. “We believe in free speech and protesting and voicing your opinion, as long as you do it in a safe manner,” Roundtree said. “As long as you’re doing that, we’re all for it.” – Will Cheney and Miguel Legoas, The Augusta Chronicle Jacksonville, Florida: Peaceful rally follows violent Saturday night of protests A peaceful demonstration was held Sunday outside the Duval County Courthouse. Then protesters started moving downtown and Jacksonville, Florida, police worked to keep them in certain areas. The cleanup of smashed store windows began Sunday around Florida after a night of unrest throughout the state’s cities. Jacksonville Sheriff Mike Williams said an unnamed deputy was either stabbed or slashed in the neck and was taken to a hospital for treatment Saturday night. A sheriff’s office spokeswoman would not comment on the deputy’s condition Sunday morning. A protest Saturday resulted in many arrests, “but we still don’t know how many or anything related to those arrests,” the sheriff said. – Sarasota News-Tribune Cincinnati: Police make 100 arrests after urging protesters to go home Police arrested as many as 100 people after using tear gas and imploring the crowd to go home ahead of a curfew. It ended a day that earlier featured a large crowd gathered at Inwood Park in Cincinnati to hear speakers as a rally, followed by a march. Organizers gave instructions about what to do if they are tear-gassed. The rally started with a fist-up salute and a song about the death Sam DuBose, shot by a police officer not far from the scene of this protest in 2015. Some Cincinnati City Council members tweeted from the rally. – Sarah Brookbank, Cincinnati Enquirer Contributing: The Associated Press",0.0

What do we tell our children?,https://www.middletowntranscript.com/zz/news/20200601/george-floyd-ahmaud-arbery-breonna-taylor-what-do-we-tell-our-children?rssfeed=true,en,False,,489844,middletowntranscript.com,http://middletowntranscript.com/,"Should we tell the children? How? Those are among the many questions parents are asking after the recent deaths of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor. Many white parents wonder whether to talk with their kids at all, while parents of color swallow their grief and fear to have ""the talk"" once again. These deaths are part of a more complex story, one some parents have been telling for generations, and others have long felt they've had the luxury to ignore. But experts in child psychology and race-based stress say these conversations are essential for all parents to have, and they underscore that there are developmentally appropriate ways to talk to children of all ages about racism and police brutality. ""Silence will not protect you or them,"" said Beverly Daniel Tatum, a psychologist and author of, Why Are All The Black Kids Sitting Together in the Cafeteria? And Other Conversations About Race. ""Avoiding the topic is not a solution."" Racism persists, experts say, because many parents avoid difficult conversations. ""One of the most important things to remember is that you may not have all the answers and that is OK,"" said Erlanger Turner, a clinical psychologist and assistant professor of psychology at Pepperdine University who studies mental health among racial communities. USA TODAY spoke with Tatum and Turner about how to talk with children about racial violence: Why is it important to talk with children about what happened to George Floyd and other incidents of police brutality or racism in the news? Beverly Daniel Tatum: Even young children may see or hear about highly publicized incidents like the George Floyd case – perhaps overhearing the TV or the radio – and may ask questions. Or if parents are upset by the news, the child may perceive the parent’s distress and ask why mom or dad is upset. In either case, an age-appropriate explanation is better than silence. Older children with Internet access may see online images on their own. Initiating an age-appropriate conversation can give children a helpful frame for understanding difficult realities. If parents are silent, children will draw their own often faulty conclusions about what is happening and why. Erlanger Turner: Many adults are hurt and angered by these events and their children may notice changes in their mood. It is helpful to have a healthy conversation around what happened and also talk about ways to cope when you witness social injustice. Does COVID-19 warrant avoiding these conversations, given many children are already struggling with fear, anxiety and uncertainty? BDT: No. Not talking about upsetting events only fuels fear, anxiety and uncertainty. Being able to talk about something with a supportive adult can reduce fear, anxiety and uncertainty. Parents may avoid the conversation because they don’t know what to say, but it is a mistake to think that their silence is helpful. ET: I don't think that anxiety and fear about COVID-19 should stop a parent from talking about police brutality. This issue has been increasing in concern over the last few years as the number of black and brown people killed by police continue to rise. I think if you do talk with your child don't leave them in a high state of worry. Make sure to end the conversation by engaging in a pleasant activity after the difficult discussion so they won't stay worried or afraid. How do parents start these conversations and how does that change depending on the age of their children? ET: I think the first place to start a conversation around racism and police brutality is with honesty. Take ownership of your feelings and be comfortable sharing those feelings with your child. Then you can begin to allow them to share what they may already know about racial differences. I think that it is always good to allow children to share their opinion and understanding before you offer information. For younger children conversations about racism should be limited to basic facts about how people are treated differently due to the color of their skin but also acknowledge that not everyone treats people differently based on race. For older teens, parents can consider exposure to news or social media posts as discussion points about this issue. BDT: Regardless of the age of the child, it is important to balance acknowledging the reality of racism, or unfairness, with messages about the possibility of change, and the community of allies who are working together to make things better. If a child of color asks if a police officer is going to kill them, what do you say? BDT: The answer will depend on the age of the child. If it is a young child, a parent can be reassuring. “No, honey, you don’t have to worry about that. Police officers don’t want to hurt you.” In response to an older child, it can be reassuring to say something like: ""I know that it is scary to think that something like that might happen, and I really don’t want you to worry about anything like that. I know that most police officers want to help people, and most police officers never fire their guns. But sometimes they do get nervous and make mistakes. So it is important for you to know what to do if a police officer ever stops you…” Black parents often refer to this as “the talk” they have to have with their adolescent sons to increase the odds they will survive an encounter with a police officer if and when they are stopped. ET: That is a tough question. Depending on the age of the child, they may have some awareness of youth that have been killed by police. Obviously you don't want to respond in a way that is going to make children be more fearful for their safety. In my opinion, I think that you should let children know that most police officers work to protect them and their community. If a child says they are afraid or angry, what do you say? BDT: Acknowledge the child’s feelings. The parent may have similar feelings. “I know it’s upsetting to hear about and see these things happening. It upsets me too when bad things like this happen. Racism is very unfair. But it makes me feel better to know there are lots of people who want to change things."" Being able to offer specific examples of community change agents would be useful. Being able to talk about what family members are doing to speak up against unfairness is especially useful. Actions always speak louder than words. ET: If a child tells you that they are angry, that is appropriate. Don't force them to hide their emotional expression. However, be sure to help them identify ways to express their anger in a healthy manner which may include journaling or exercising to release the energy from their body. If a child is afraid for one of their friends, what do you say? BDT: “I can see that you are worried about your friend. What do you think we could do that might help him or her?” Depending on the situation, this could be an opportunity to talk about what it means to be an ally, and how to stand in solidarity with another person. ET: If a child is afraid for one of their friends, talk with them about those emotions. Allow the child to express why they may be afraid and help them identify how they can check on their friend's safety to ease their anxiety or fear. Part of what increases anxiety is the fear of the unknown. If you have a plan of action it will reduce some of those fears. How can parents talk about law enforcement in a way that is honest but also doesn’t discourage children from seeking help from law enforcement when appropriate? BDT: Most police officers become police officers because they want to help people. And there are times when we would really want a police officer to help us – give some examples – if there’s been a car accident, or if someone took something that belonged to us, etc. But sometimes a police officer does something bad, like today. When that happens, we might start to think that all police officers are like that. But it’s important to remember that that is not true. ET: I think that it is very important to talk with the children about law enforcement. For example, you can talk with them about how they protect rules in society such as making sure that people don't drive too fast so they won't harm themselves or others. Providing clear examples about the ways that law enforcement helps society will allow the child to better understand. You can also be honest about situations such as police brutality and let children know that some police officers break laws. If you have a trusted officer in your community it may be good to also allow the child to talk with them in person to reduce their fear. Should these conversations be different depending on the race of the child? BDT: Children of color are likely to experience racist encounters as they get older. They need to be helped to understand their own worth and feel affirmed in their identity as young people of color despite the negative messages they may get from others. Parents of color want to raise self-confident and empowered children who are not demoralized by other people’s racism. This requires lots of conversation about racism and how to resist it in an ongoing way throughout their children’s lives. White children are often racially isolated as a consequence of segregated schools and neighborhoods, and consequently limited in their understanding of people different from themselves. White parents who want to interrupt the cycle of racism must learn to talk to their children about it and model their own anti-racist activity. ET: According to research, white parents often don't talk with their children about race or may emphasize ""not seeing color."" The concept of colorblindness or ""not seeing color"" is more harmful than helpful and does not honor an individual's identity. ... For white families, research suggests ... conversations should focus on raising anti-racist children and encouraging more friendships with children from others races. Many of these deaths garner attention because footage of it goes viral. What should we say if our child asks to see it? BDT: There are many adults who don’t want to see such footage. I would not show it to a child at all. Once an image is in your head, it is very difficult to get it out. That said, it is reasonable to describe what happened and talk about why it was wrong. It is also likely that children with Internet access can view the footage without an adult’s permission or assistance. Talking about it after the fact will help children process their feelings. ET: You should not show your children these videos as it may increase the likelihood of them experiencing symptoms of trauma or having nightmares. What we know from research on witnessing disasters is that individuals may be at a higher risk of developing post-traumatic stress disorder even through indirect exposure to these events. What do we say if, in the course of this conversation, a child says something racist? BDT: Inquire about it with curiosity, not judgment. ""I’m wondering why you said that…"" After hearing more about what the child is thinking, you can offer correction by providing new information. “You know, a lot of people might think that is true, but I don’t because….” ET: I think the first thing to do is to not get defensive. You want to foster open communication with your child. However, I think you should explore why they have that opinion, where did they learn it from, and tell them why what they said was wrong. It might be helpful for you as a parent to think about ways that you may have unconsciously expressed racist attitudes. How can parents explain the uprisings in a way that doesn’t condone violence but also doesn't minimize the sense of injustice fueling them? BDT: Children understand the concept of unfairness as well as the experience of frustration. Years and years of unfairness – racism – results in intense anger and frustration. The conversation can then be about what we must do to fix the continuing unfairness. ET: I think it is important for parents to be honest. Share your hurt, anger, or disappointment with your child. You should also talk about different ways to protest social injustice such as calling your local politicians office or even visit their office to talk with them about policy change to reduce injustice.

Biden, the former vice president and presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, has struggled in recent weeks to be heard from his makeshift home TV studio over the noise of dueling national crises. But after another night of violent protests, Biden gathered with roughly a dozen local black leaders during an intimate hometown meeting ahead of a virtual meeting with mayors from Los Angeles, Atlanta, Chicago and St. Paul, Minnesota. “Hate just hides. It doesn’t go away, and when you have somebody in power who breathes oxygen into the hate under the rocks, it comes out from under the rocks,” Biden said, his face mask lowered around his chin, after several participants shared their thoughts on police brutality. If elected, he promised to “deal with institutional racism” and set up a police oversight body in his first 100 days in office. Biden’s low-key, high-touch approach marked a sharp contrast to that of President Donald Trump, who has made little effort to unify the country. The Republican president slammed governors as “weak” during a video teleconference Monday and demanded tougher crackdowns on protesters. Trump also lashed out at Biden on Twitter, writing that “Sleepy Joe Biden’s people are so Radical Left that they are working to get the Anarchists out of jail, and probably more.” Biden’s softer approach may foreshadow how he presents himself in the five months before the presidential election, emphasizing calm and competence as a contrast to a mercurial president. It is an approach that carries the risk of being drowned out by Trump’s much louder voice. “He’s not in office, and he certainly does not have the megaphone like the person currently occupying the White House does, but I do think our people are looking for someone who can make them feel better during these extremely tough times,” said Rep. Val Demings of Florida, whom Biden is considering as a running mate. “America just needs to be reassured that there’s someone who’s understanding, someone who’s willing to say, ‘Yes, we do have some issues,’ and someone who’s willing to address it.” Reassurance requires presence, and that has been a hurdle for the former vice president, driven inside by the coronavirus pandemic, still working to adapt to the power of social media as a substitute and without the natural platform of a public office. Biden delivered a well-received address on Friday calling on white people to shoulder the responsibility of ending America’s systemic racism. But he was largely out of sight over the weekend, which marked the fifth anniversary of the death of his son Beau Biden from brain cancer.",0.0

Erlanger Turner: Many adults are hurt and angered by these events and their children may notice changes in their mood. It is helpful to have a healthy conversation around what happened and also talk about ways to cope when you witness social injustice. Does COVID-19 warrant avoiding these conversations, given many children are already struggling with fear, anxiety and uncertainty? BDT: No. Not talking about upsetting events only fuels fear, anxiety and uncertainty. Being able to talk about something with a supportive adult can reduce fear, anxiety and uncertainty. Parents may avoid the conversation because they don’t know what to say, but it is a mistake to think that their silence is helpful. ET: I don't think that anxiety and fear about COVID-19 should stop a parent from talking about police brutality. This issue has been increasing in concern over the last few years as the number of black and brown people killed by police continue to rise. I think if you do talk with your child don't leave them in a high state of worry. Make sure to end the conversation by engaging in a pleasant activity after the difficult discussion so they won't stay worried or afraid. How do parents start these conversations and how does that change depending on the age of their children? ET: I think the first place to start a conversation around racism and police brutality is with honesty. Take ownership of your feelings and be comfortable sharing those feelings with your child. Then you can begin to allow them to share what they may already know about racial differences. I think that it is always good to allow children to share their opinion and understanding before you offer information. For younger children conversations about racism should be limited to basic facts about how people are treated differently due to the color of their skin but also acknowledge that not everyone treats people differently based on race. For older teens, parents can consider exposure to news or social media posts as discussion points about this issue. BDT: Regardless of the age of the child, it is important to balance acknowledging the reality of racism, or unfairness, with messages about the possibility of change, and the community of allies who are working together to make things better. If a child of color asks if a police officer is going to kill them, what do you say? BDT: The answer will depend on the age of the child. If it is a young child, a parent can be reassuring. “No, honey, you don’t have to worry about that. Police officers don’t want to hurt you.” In response to an older child, it can be reassuring to say something like: ""I know that it is scary to think that something like that might happen, and I really don’t want you to worry about anything like that. I know that most police officers want to help people, and most police officers never fire their guns. But sometimes they do get nervous and make mistakes. So it is important for you to know what to do if a police officer ever stops you…” Black parents often refer to this as “the talk” they have to have with their adolescent sons to increase the odds they will survive an encounter with a police officer if and when they are stopped. ET: That is a tough question. Depending on the age of the child, they may have some awareness of youth that have been killed by police. Obviously you don't want to respond in a way that is going to make children be more fearful for their safety. In my opinion, I think that you should let children know that most police officers work to protect them and their community. If a child says they are afraid or angry, what do you say? BDT: Acknowledge the child’s feelings. The parent may have similar feelings. “I know it’s upsetting to hear about and see these things happening. It upsets me too when bad things like this happen. Racism is very unfair. But it makes me feel better to know there are lots of people who want to change things."" Being able to offer specific examples of community change agents would be useful. Being able to talk about what family members are doing to speak up against unfairness is especially useful. Actions always speak louder than words. ET: If a child tells you that they are angry, that is appropriate. Don't force them to hide their emotional expression. However, be sure to help them identify ways to express their anger in a healthy manner which may include journaling or exercising to release the energy from their body. If a child is afraid for one of their friends, what do you say? BDT: “I can see that you are worried about your friend. What do you think we could do that might help him or her?” Depending on the situation, this could be an opportunity to talk about what it means to be an ally, and how to stand in solidarity with another person. ET: If a child is afraid for one of their friends, talk with them about those emotions. Allow the child to express why they may be afraid and help them identify how they can check on their friend's safety to ease their anxiety or fear. Part of what increases anxiety is the fear of the unknown. If you have a plan of action it will reduce some of those fears. How can parents talk about law enforcement in a way that is honest but also doesn’t discourage children from seeking help from law enforcement when appropriate? BDT: Most police officers become police officers because they want to help people. And there are times when we would really want a police officer to help us – give some examples – if there’s been a car accident, or if someone took something that belonged to us, etc. But sometimes a police officer does something bad, like today. When that happens, we might start to think that all police officers are like that. But it’s important to remember that that is not true. ET: I think that it is very important to talk with the children about law enforcement. For example, you can talk with them about how they protect rules in society such as making sure that people don't drive too fast so they won't harm themselves or others. Providing clear examples about the ways that law enforcement helps society will allow the child to better understand. You can also be honest about situations such as police brutality and let children know that some police officers break laws. If you have a trusted officer in your community it may be good to also allow the child to talk with them in person to reduce their fear. Should these conversations be different depending on the race of the child? BDT: Children of color are likely to experience racist encounters as they get older. They need to be helped to understand their own worth and feel affirmed in their identity as young people of color despite the negative messages they may get from others. Parents of color want to raise self-confident and empowered children who are not demoralized by other people’s racism. This requires lots of conversation about racism and how to resist it in an ongoing way throughout their children’s lives. White children are often racially isolated as a consequence of segregated schools and neighborhoods, and consequently limited in their understanding of people different from themselves. White parents who want to interrupt the cycle of racism must learn to talk to their children about it and model their own anti-racist activity. ET: According to research, white parents often don't talk with their children about race or may emphasize ""not seeing color."" The concept of colorblindness or ""not seeing color"" is more harmful than helpful and does not honor an individual's identity. ... For white families, research suggests ... conversations should focus on raising anti-racist children and encouraging more friendships with children from others races. Many of these deaths garner attention because footage of it goes viral. What should we say if our child asks to see it? BDT: There are many adults who don’t want to see such footage. I would not show it to a child at all. Once an image is in your head, it is very difficult to get it out. That said, it is reasonable to describe what happened and talk about why it was wrong. It is also likely that children with Internet access can view the footage without an adult’s permission or assistance. Talking about it after the fact will help children process their feelings. ET: You should not show your children these videos as it may increase the likelihood of them experiencing symptoms of trauma or having nightmares. What we know from research on witnessing disasters is that individuals may be at a higher risk of developing post-traumatic stress disorder even through indirect exposure to these events. What do we say if, in the course of this conversation, a child says something racist? BDT: Inquire about it with curiosity, not judgment. ""I’m wondering why you said that…"" After hearing more about what the child is thinking, you can offer correction by providing new information. “You know, a lot of people might think that is true, but I don’t because….” ET: I think the first thing to do is to not get defensive. You want to foster open communication with your child. However, I think you should explore why they have that opinion, where did they learn it from, and tell them why what they said was wrong. It might be helpful for you as a parent to think about ways that you may have unconsciously expressed racist attitudes. How can parents explain the uprisings in a way that doesn’t condone violence but also doesn't minimize the sense of injustice fueling them? BDT: Children understand the concept of unfairness as well as the experience of frustration. Years and years of unfairness – racism – results in intense anger and frustration. The conversation can then be about what we must do to fix the continuing unfairness. ET: I think it is important for parents to be honest. Share your hurt, anger, or disappointment with your child. You should also talk about different ways to protest social injustice such as calling your local politicians office or even visit their office to talk with them about policy change to reduce injustice.

There have been five nights of anguished protests following the Monday death of George Floyd, a black man whose neck was knelt on for nearly nine minutes by Derek Chauvin, a white police officer.

Meanwhile, Dan Halvorsen picked up trash and swept away debris along with seven other members of his church in suburban Bloomington. “We wanted to perform a good deed.

Soon, they descended on her with sacks of bread, beans and other groceries, plus diapers, bottled water and even more garbage bags ready to be filled. Knutson, who said she is recently homeless, enjoyed giving the goods away to a line of people who politely approached her, asking if it was really free. “Anything you want, brother.

Delaware News Journal In a meeting with black Wilmington leaders Monday, Joe Biden said he will create a police oversight board in the first 100 days of his presidency. The former vice president and presumed Democratic presidential nominee met with about a dozen community leaders at Bethel AME Church in Wilmington, including U.S. Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester. It was his first in-person campaign event since March due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Like in cities across the country, Delawareans protested in Wilmington following the death of George Floyd, a black man who died after a white police officer in Minneapolis pressed his knee into his neck for about eight minutes. In Wilmington on Saturday, a peaceful protest turned heated and eventually violent as day turned into night. The evening ended with more than a dozen businesses on Market and Shipley streets being damaged or looted. On Sunday afternoon, Biden visited Market Street to see the recovery efforts. Later that day, a protest in Dover ended with the Dover Mall being looted. We are a nation in pain right now, but we must not allow this pain to destroy us.

A couple of people spoke about their relationship with Biden's son Beau, who died five years ago from brain cancer.

The candidate, wearing a blue suit, sat at the front of the church and took notes. The community leaders, many of them pastors, wore masks and sat far apart in the pews. When he got up and spoke, pushing down the mask on his face, Biden said the COVID-19 epidemic has ripped the ""Band-Aid"" off the problems this country faces. ""Nobody can pretend any longer what this is all about,"" Biden said. ""Nobody can pretend who has carried us on our backs. It’s been minorities. It's been Hispanics. It’s been blacks."" Throughout the campaign, Biden has remarked about the 1968 riots in Wilmington, and how it shaped him as a young adult. On Monday, he said that time in Wilmington contributed to his decision to quit the law firm he was working for and become a public defender, which he was for a brief time. He also credited his relationships with Delaware's black community as the foundation for his strong support from black Americans nationwide. Biden said his administration would have an economic recovery plan that ""deals with the institutional structures and institutional racism."" He hinted about releasing a new economic plan in the coming weeks. When he finished speaking, Biden asked the group if they would join him in prayer. “This is like family,"" he said.

The protests over George Floyd's death hit the nation's capital Friday night as angry protesters arrived at Pennsylvania Avenue, leading to a lockdown at the White House. Outside the White House on Friday, Secret Service could be seen after 7 p.m. taking at least one person into custody. Videos showed a large group of protesters gathering, with some burning flags and knocking over barricades. There were also some violent encounters. The president remained there about an hour before returning to the residence, according to a Republican close to the White House and an administration official who spoke to the Associated Press on the condition of anonymity. It is currently unknown whether first lady Melania Trump and their son, Barron, were with the president but the family has been shaken by the size and venom of the crowds, AP reported. ""The White House does not comment on security protocols and decisions,” said White House spokesman Judd Deere. The Secret Service said it does not discuss the means and methods of its protective operations. Officials told The New York Times, which first reported the story, they never believed Trump was in danger but took the precaution of moving him to the bunker as tensions escalated. Trump has told advisers he worries about his safety, while both privately and publicly praising the work of the Secret Service, according to the AP. Floyd, an unarmed black man, died in Minneapolis police custody this week after a white officer pinned him to the ground under his knee. His death has sparked demonstrations against police brutality and racial discrimination in cities across the United States. Trump praised the Secret Service and said he “watched every move” from inside the White House during Friday's protest and that he “couldn't have felt more safe.” ""They let the ‘protesters’ scream & rant as much as they wanted, but whenever someone got too frisky or out of line, they would quickly come down on them, hard – didn’t know what hit them,"" he said Saturday. Trump continued, ""The front line was replaced with fresh agents, like magic. Big crowd, professionally organized, but nobody came close to breaching the fence. If they had, they would have been greeted with the most vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons, I have ever seen. That’s when people would have been really badly hurt, at least."" He also claimed DC Mayor Muriel Bowser didn't allow DC police to ""get involved"" and assist Secret Service, though Secret Service later said they were on the scene. Bowser, a Democrat, said on Twitter the city's police department would protect everyone regardless of whether the mayor agreed with them. ""While he hides behind his fence afraid/alone, I stand w/ people peacefully exercising their First Amendment Right after the murder of #GeorgeFloyd & hundreds of years of institutional racism There are no vicious dogs & ominous weapons. There is just a scared man,"" she wrote. This is the same bunker Vice President Dick Cheney was brought after the September 11 attacks when authorities feared a hijacked plane hijacked was heading toward the White House. President George W. Bush, when he returned to D.C. later that evening, was later taken there after a false alarm of another plane. The recent protests have led to one of the highest alerts at the White House complex since those attacks.",0.0

More than 4,400 arrests have been made at protests nationwide since viral video emerged showing former Minneapolis Officer Derek Chauvin holding his knee to Floyd's neck for more than eight minutes on Memorial Day, resulting in Floyd's death. Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo apologized to Floyd's family Sunday, saying that firing Chauvin and the other three officers involved in the incident was the right thing to do. Peaceful protests continued to be marred by violence. The Minneapolis Department of Public safety confirmed a semi-truck drove into a group of peaceful protesters on Interstate 35. The driver of the truck was taken into custody, but not before protesters pulled him from the truck's cab. The driver was taken to the hospital with minor injuries. Elsewhere, vandalism and looting continued across the country, as did the use of tear gas and rubber bullets by police in confrontations with protesters. Reports: President Trump hustled to bunker amid Washington protests President Donald Trump was briefly moved to the White House's underground bunker Friday night to shelter in place as the protest grew outside the Executive Mansion, according to multiple outlets. The protests over George Floyd's death hit the nation's capital Friday night as angry protesters arrived at Pennsylvania Avenue, leading to a lockdown at the White House. Dozens of Secret Service agents were injured in clashes with protesters over the weekend, and videos showed a large group of protesters – some burning flags and knocking over barricades. CNN reported that the president remained in the bunker for about an hour before returning to the residence, and it is currently unknown whether the First Lady and their son, Barron, were with him. – Savannah Behrmann 2 Atlanta officers fired, accused of excessive force against protesters Atlanta officials fired two police officers and placed three on desk duty pending review over the alleged use of excessive force against protesters in a clash Saturday night. Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said she saw a video, which she called ""disturbing,"" of five officers pulling two college students out of a car downtown. Bottoms and police Chief Erika Shields made the announcement at a press conference after reviewing body-camera footage. ""We understand that our officers are working very long hours under an enormous amount of stress,"" Bottoms said. ""But we also understand that the use of excessive force is never acceptable."" – Jessica Flores At least 4,400 arrests since George Floyd's death: AP data At least 4,400 people nationwide have been arrested over days of protests since George Floyd’s death on Memorial Day, according to a tally compiled by The Associated Press. About 150 people were arrested in Minnesota after violating curfew amid protests Sunday night, the Minnesota Department of Public Safety tweeted. DPS continued to tweet about arrests late into the night and added, ""Even peaceful protesters who are breaking curfew are subject to arrest. Please go home and stay there."" DPS announced the arrests of more than 155 people Saturday night across multiple agencies. A dozen firearms were confiscated between the State Patrol and the Minneapolis Police Department. Historic St. John's Church near White House set ablaze amid DC protests As protesters gathered near the White House, flames were seen at Washington, D.C., landmark that bills itself as ""the church of the presidents."" The fire, apparently an act of arson, was in the basement of St. John's Church, across from the White House, The Washington Post reported, and was extinguished. It occurred as a demonstration was taking place outside. The gathering had attracted as many as 1,000 Sunday, who faced off against officers in riot gear. The Episcopalian church in Lafayette Square boasts on its website that every U.S. president since James Madison has attended services. Consecrated in 1816, the church also says the bell in its steeple, weighing almost 1,000 pounds, was cast in 1822 by Paul Revere's son Joseph. Illinois governor calls on National Guard to assist Chicago police Vandalism and fires were reported in several Chicago neighborhoods and some suburbs Sunday night after Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot severely restricted access to downtown following nights of violent protests. The communities of Tinley Park, Crestwood and Oak Lawn alerted residents to stay home due to civil unrest. Many businesses boarded up. Gov. J.B. Pritzker said he activated 375 Illinois National Guard soldiers to assist local law enforcement with street closures. ""This has been a scary and unsettling time, but I know we will get through this and begin the process of healing together,"" Lightfoot said in a midnight Twitter post. ""Please stay safe, and stay home."" Minneapolis police chief: George Floyd's death 'a violation of humanity' Minneapolis Police Department Chief Medaria Arradondo told CNN that George Floyd's death was ""a violation of humanity."" Speaking at the site where Floyd died after fired police officer Derek Chauvin held his knee to Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes, Arradondo apologized to Floyd's family and said he had a ""visceral"" and ""emotional"" reaction to the video that has sparked outrage across the nation. “There are absolute truths in life,"" Arradondo told CNN. ""We need air to breathe. ... I did not need days or weeks or months or processes or bureaucracies to tell me what occurred out here last Monday, it was wrong.” When asked why he fired the four officers involved in the incident that led to Floyd's death, Arradondo said: ""In my mind, this was a violation of humanity. This was a violation of the oath the majority of the men and women that put this uniform on — this goes absolutely against it. This goes contrary to what we believe in."" Protesters vandalize, set fire to police SUVs in New Jersey A group of people was captured on video destroying police SUVs in Trenton, New Jersey. In the video, the people vandalize three police vehicles, smashing windows and hitting and kicking the vehicles. One of the people opens a door to the SUV and those at the scene start lighting things inside of it on fire. Police eventually got to the scene and began pushing back protesters as the vehicles burned behind them. Minnesota AG Keith Ellison to lead prosecution of Derek Chauvin Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz announced Sunday that state Attorney General Keith Ellison will lead the prosecution in the Floyd case. Ellison called the case “unusual because of the way that Mr. Floyd was killed and who did it — at the hands of the defendant who was a Minneapolis police officer.” He said he expects to work together with Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman on the case. Ellison didn’t announce additional charges for Chauvin or charges for the three other officers involved in the incident. He added “prosecuting police officers for misconduct, including homicide and murder, is very difficult.” “Every single link in the prosecutorial chain will come under attack as we present this case to a jury or a fact finder and we need to make sure that we be absolutely prepared. We intend to be absolutely prepared.”",0.0

What's next for Minneapolis-area small business owners in danger of losing livelihoods?",https://www.hockessincommunitynews.com/zz/news/20200601/their-stores-were-burned-ransacked-and-looted-whats-next-for-minneapolis-area-small-business-owners-in-danger-of-losing-livelihoods?rssfeed=true,en,False,,348142,hockessincommunitynews.com,http://hockessincommunitynews.com/,"MINNEAPOLIS — Brandy Moore likened the charred remains of her south Minneapolis clothing store and recording studio to the pangs for equality that minorities here feel. Smoke continued to waft in the air 24 hours after people protesting the death of George Floyd lit fire to Moore's storefront, and several others along Lake Street. ""My business burned down two days ago, you see the flames? It's still going,"" Moore, 41, said Sunday. ""That flame down in people's soul? It's still going. They want justice."" She is among dozens of Minneapolis and St. Paul business owners, small and large, trying to rebuild after fiery riots and demonstrations in the Twin Cities on Thursday and Friday. Her company, ""Levels,"" which also has a St. Paul location that remains undamaged, was Moore's ""baby."" Moore, a black woman, said she started the business from the trunk of her car once she left a job with Minneapolis Public Schools in 2011 to pursue her passion for fashion and music. It had been opened for five years before people broke in Friday and started a fire that destroyed her business and several adjacent stores. When she was alerted to the break-in, Moore went to Lake Street and watched nearly a decade of work collapse into the concrete. ""I'm hurt that I lost this. But ... I can't cry right now,"" she said. ""I can't go home and cry and be hurt because I lost businesses. George Floyd lost his life. He'll never be here again."" She's confident she can recover but isn't sure if she can rebuild at the same location — in the heart of a diverse southside neighborhood. A GoFundMe has been started to help with those expenses. Other small businesses face similar uncertainty, but several fundraisers have been started to help support Minneapolis' littlest companies. As looters ransacked his St. Paul store, this business owner hid in the bathroom and whispered to 911 In St. Paul's Midway neighborhood, just blocks from where Moore's second Levels location was protected by armed men standing on its porch, one business owner said he hid in his office as people ransacked, urinated in and damaged the building. Jim Segal closed Ax-Man Surplus earlier than normal Thursday afternoon because daylight looting took hold at the nearby intersection of University and Snelling avenues. After sending customers and employees home and locking the front door, Segal said he continued to work in the office of the six-decade-old company. Then he heard multiple glass windows break. ""Luckily, I have a steel door because they were trying to enter the office,"" said Segal, who bought the surplus store about 20 years ago. ""I don't think they knew anybody was in there, but I basically barricaded myself within a bathroom inside the office."" He felt as if he were in a movie, the St. Paul native said. As display cases were shattered and electronics taken from inside his store, he whispered to 911 dispatch asking for help. ""Police said, 'Don't even bother boarding up your store,'"" Segal said Saturday. ""'There's a 50/50 chance it won't be here tomorrow."" About 6:30 p.m. Thursday, he returned to the St. Paul Ax-Man location, one of three in the metro, in an unsuccessful effort to shoo away people running in and out of his store. A company agreed to board up his windows, Segal said, but left quickly after arriving, not wanting to work amongst the crowd. He tried to get a license plate of someone stealing, but others tried to take his phone so he retreated to his car. Segal sat in his vehicle for hours as rioters peed in his store and took items ranging from knick-knacks and DVDs to a snow-blower. He said coronavirus concerns forced him to close his business for the better part of two months. They'd been reopened a little more than a week when the building was ransacked. ""I don't recall ever being in a situation where I was that panicked. I was petrified, actually,"" he said. Ax-Man won't reopen for at least a week or two, and Segal fears it may close permanently because of the lack of sales during the spring. That would mean a loss of livelihood for him and about 10 employees. He sympathizes with those upset about Floyd's death in police custody on Memorial Day, describing the video of Minneapolis police officers' actions ""horrific."" ""This is just stuff, no comparison (to a person dying),"" said Segal, a white man. ""But what I'm disappointed about is the lack of leadership in the government — Mayor (Melvin) Carter, Mayor (Jacob) Frey, Gov. (Tim) Walz — to just allow lawlessness. ""Indefensible what happened to Mr. Floyd, but this doesn't make it better. And I don't know what does."" Insurance helps small business owners, but a full recovery is 'a lot more complicated' While Moore and Segal both said they are insured, they don't believe insurance alone will enough to replace everything they've lost. People typically see business owner and think ""wealth,"" Segal said. ""That's not true for me,"" he said. ""I'm the last one to get paid."" Understanding insurance policies can be difficult for many small business owners, said Allison Sharkey, executive director of the Lake Street Council, which supports local companies. Lake Street has always been an area for Minneapolis's immigrant entrepreneurs to start businesses, she said, and many of those folks may not be familiar with aid systems or insurance proceedings. ""There's a lot of detail to go through in your contract that most people don't really understand until a situation like this happens,"" Sharkey said. ""It's a lot more complicated than just paying a $500 deductible and thinking the rest is going to be covered."" Minority business owners may not have the credit or assets to withstand closures as long as white business owners with more resources, she said. The council, and other metro business associations like it, try to fill that gap and provide guidance, but insurance claims won't stop some businesses from completely fading away. For Moore, she's frustrated when people bring up the fact she's insured because it ignores the work she put into the building and the items she won't get back. ""When you get it out the mud — meaning when you get it on your own, no handouts ... someone just handing you money doesn't equate,"" she said. ""It's deeper than that."" Financial support is coming for Twin Cities small businesses left in rubble amid George Floyd protests When Segal returned to his business Friday, he found a person who lived nearby sweeping glass from the sidewalk, which raised his spirits. Monetary support has begun, too. It's especially vital, small business advocates say, because many companies were already running out of money because of closures due to COVID-19. The Lake Street Council has received over $1.5 million to help support the hundreds of businesses that line the heavily damaged area. Sharkey said companies owned by people of color and immigrants have been especially affected by the days of unrest. Several ""big, beautiful"" buildings on the southside have been replaced by rubble, which will be eventually replaced by vacant lots. ""($1.5 million) sounds like a big number, but we're gonna need a lot more government and nonprofit support,"" Sharkey said. ""We have a long road ahead of us."" She said her organization had already begun to save money to distribute to companies dealing with financial contractions from the coronavirus, but it's not been shifted to riot recovery. The council will request an aid package from the state, but Sharkey thinks they'll need federal dollars as well. ""We're headed toward a recession,"" she said. ""We're really going to have to create a long-term strategy along with stakeholders, business owners, property owners business groups, elected officials."" Donations to that fund can be made here. Fundraising has begun in Segal's area, as well. The Hamline Midway Coalition has received more than $75,000 to help aid small businesses in their recovery from property damage and lost sales. Kate Mudge, the coalition's director, said the organization has been raising funds to help small and minority business owners worried about gentrification and corporatization coming with the new U.S. soccer stadium built nearby. ""We already have been dealing with a pandemic, we've been dealing with some long-term issues in our community, and this is the icing on the cake. We hope that this is gonna bring new people to Midway, new businesses,"" she said. ""We've dealt with worse."" Donations to the Midway fund can be made at here. Despite the uncertainty, the organizations are confident many businesses will survive if community support keeps up. ""I'm not blaming people, you can't judge anybody's pain or anger. Everyone acts and reacts to things in different ways,"" Moore said. ""I have a black-owned business, it was burned down and we were protesting, for a black man's life that was taken. So, I was just a little confused on where we're going with this. But, at the end of the day, everything is about sacrifices.""",0.0
1622526367,2020-06-01 10:51:55,What is antifa and what does the movement want?,https://www.hockessincommunitynews.com/zz/news/20200601/what-is-antifa-and-what-does-movement-want?rssfeed=true,en,False,,348142,hockessincommunitynews.com,http://hockessincommunitynews.com/,"Antifa — short for ""anti-fascist"" — is the name for loosely affiliated, left-leaning anti-racist groups that monitor and track the activities of local neo-Nazis. The movement has no unified structure or national leadership but has emerged in the form of local bodies nationwide, particularly on the West Coast. Some of the groups, such as the 10-year-old Rose City Antifa in Portland, the oldest antifa group in the U.S., are particularly well-organized and active online and on Facebook, while its members are individually anonymous. President Trump has singled out antifa as part of what he calls the alt-left in his initial claim that ""many sides"" were to blame for violence in Charlottesville the weekend of Aug. 12, not just the neo-Nazis, KKK and white nationalists. How is it pronounced? ""AN-tifa"" with the emphasis on the first syllable, which sounds more like ""on"" in English than ""an."" When did it start? Anti-fascist groups, particularly in Europe, have been around for many decades, notably in Italy, against Mussolini, and in Germany, against Hitler. In the postwar period, antifa groups resurged to fight neo-Nazi groups, particularly in Germany. In the U.S., the anti-fascist movements grew out of leftist politics of the late '80s, primarily under the umbrella of Anti-Racist Action. What does the movement want? The primary goal is to stop neo-Nazis and white supremacists from gaining a platform rather than to promote a specific antifa agenda. The antifa groups are decidedly anti-racist, anti-sexist and anti-homophobia, but also by and large socially leftist and anti-capitalist. How do the groups operate? Mark Bray, a lecturer and Dartmouth and author of the new book Antifa: The Antifascist Handbook, says the groups ""organize educational campaigns, build community coalitions, monitor fascists, pressure venues to cancel their events, organize self-defense trainings and physically confront the far right when necessary."" A main goal is to try to deny fascists a public forum, which is why they turn out in numbers to physically confront neo-Nazis, the KKK and white supremacists at public demonstrations. They also step in to protect counter-protesters at such events. In addition, antifa is particularly active in ""doxxing,"" or identifying neo-Nazis and like-minded individuals and disseminating that private information to the public and employers to discourage people from joining their ranks. Is antifa violent? Members pointedly do not eschew violence but rather see themselves as engaging in ""self-defense,"" protecting other protesters and primarily confronting neo-Nazis and white supremacists to deny them a platform to publicly spread their views. ""We are unapologetic about the reality that fighting fascism at points requires physical militancy,” Rose City Antifa’s Facebook page reads. “Anti-fascism is, by nature, a form of self-defense: the goal of fascism is to exterminate the vast majority of human beings.” Political activist and author Cornel West, speaking to Amy Goodman on the program Democracy Now about the clashes in Charlottesville, said antifa intervened when the ""neofascists"" move against his group of protesters. ""We would have been crushed like cockroaches if it were not for the anarchists and the anti-fascists,"" he said. Bray says the rise of fascism in the 1930s demonstrates that it was a mistake to allow such groups to air their views in hopes that public opinion would blunt their growth. ""We should be wary of those who are more distressed about alleged violations of the speech of fascists than the actual violence they perpetrate,"" he says. Where has the movement demonstrated? In addition to Charlottesville, antifa forces, who often dress in black and wear masks, have confronted or clashed with far-right groups in such places as the University of California at Berkeley, where protests by West Coast antifa forces, some of whom smashed windows and set fires, forced the cancellation of a speech by alt-right activist Milo Yiannopoulos in February and another by conservative commentator Ann Coulter in April. In June, antifa forces turned out to protest a pro-Trump free-speech in Portland. Some antifa counterprotesters began throwing objects at police, who responded with flash grenades and pepper balls, according to the The Oregonian. Antifa was also out in force in June to confront Patriot Prayer, a free speech group protesting “political correctness and hatred” at Evergreen State College in Olympia, Wash.",0.0

Most demonstrations, some attracting hundreds of people, were peaceful though violence, including the burning of police vehicles and looting, prompted police in some cities to deploy tear gas to gain control of the crowd. Early in the day, volunteers turned out in many cities to sweep up debris from businesses that had been burned, had their windows broken or were otherwise damaged Saturday. Here's a look at how protests are unfolding around the country on Sunday: Washington, D.C.: Historic St. John's Church near White House set ablaze As protesters gathered near the White House, flames were seen at the Washington, D.C., landmark that bills itself as ""the church of the presidents."" The fire, apparently an act of arson, was in the basement of St. John's Church, across from the White House, The Washington Post reported, and was extinguished.

New York City: Protesters force closure of Manhattan Bridge; street fires, looting A crucial bridge into Manhattan was closed Sunday to make way for protesters, a day after hundreds of arrests including the mayor's daughter, it was reported. Street fires were being set and sporadic looting was reported Sunday evening after a day that saw large groups of protesters walk from Brooklyn to Manhattan over the Manhattan Bridge, which had to be closed, ABC7 in New York reported. Mayor Bill de Blasio's daughter Chiara, 25, was among 345 arrested, the station reported based on unnamed NYPD sources. The Daily Mail said it was able to confirm the arrest from a police report. She was reportedly arrested as part of a group of 100 demonstrators who refused to leave a roadway when ordered by police. Seattle: National Guard called to Bellevue; protesters block Interstate 5 National Guard troops were ordered to the Seattle suburb of Bellevue after reports of widespread looting. Washington Gov. Jay Inslee ordered 200 National Guard members to Bellevue after the mayor declared an emergency due to violence. Rioters broke into the Bellevue Mall and were stealing goods from stores. The thefts were part of a day of protests in the Seattle area that included shutting down Interstate 5, the same freeway that San Diego demonstrators blocked more than 1,000 miles away in southern California. Chicago: Gov. JB Pritzker activates National Guardsmen to assist police Vandalism reports continued to crop up in several city neighborhoods and some suburbs. The communities of Tinley Park, Crestwood and Oak Lawn alerted residents to stay home due to civil unrest. Many businesses boarded up. Gov. J.B. Pritzker said he activated 375 Illinois National Guard soldiers to assist local law enforcement with street closures. The downtown Chicago demonstrations that drew thousands started peacefully Saturday afternoon in a plaza, with protesters reading the names of black people who have died at the hands of police. But that gave way to violence and destruction that continued overnight Sunday in Chicago and elsewhere. Police used batons to beat back demonstrators as police cars were set ablaze and windows were smashed at businesses ranging from neighborhood convenience stores to high-end Michigan Avenue shops. Santa Monica, California: Unchecked looting as marchers confront police Looters took advantage of a large demonstration several blocks away to hit stores in the city's business district. In late afternoon, police were met with resistance when they tried to end a demonstration that had been peaceful. Demonstrators constructed a makeshift barricade in the middle of a street to protect themselves from non-lethal rounds fired by officers. The march had attracted hundreds along the city's main oceanfront boulevard. Though there were many police officers present for the march, looters were able to plunder stores with few to stop them. Cars were seen pulling up in front of stores, with looters running in to collect bundles of clothes and other merchandise, then running out. Boxes littered the sidewalk as thieves were seen transferring goods into plastic trash bags. A 5:30 p.m. PST curfew was announced due to the protests. The looting came despite the arrival of the National Guard troops in neighboring Los Angeles, which had seen extensive looting, vandalism and arson on Saturday. Murfreesboro, Tennessee: Brick thrown into business, police use tear gas A small but tense demonstration in Murfreesboro, Tennessee, appeared to have dispersed after demonstrators blocked traffic and threw a brick through the window of a local business, prompting police to respond with canisters of tear gas. About 50 protesters, many of whom appeared to be Middle Tennessee State University students, marched from Main Street toward Forrest Hall, a campus building named for Confederate general and Ku Klux Klan founder Nathan Bedford Forrest. Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee said protests in Murfreesboro are now “overt threats to public safety and property.” Police said an armored vehicle was vandalized and protesters have blocked traffic by lying in the street in an intersection. Officers responded by throwing canisters of tear gas to drive protesters out of the street. However, before the protest escalated, negotiations between police and protest leaders led to calm, then students and officers were seen walking together and posing for photos. – Nancy DeGennaro, Joseph Spears, Mealand Ragland-Hudgins and Brinley Hineman, Murfreesboro Daily News Journal Savannah, Georgia: Protesters chant 'Arrest the other three' during rally Thousands demonstrated against racism and the killings of black people at the hands of police Sunday in Savannah, Georgia. City leaders joined protesters who peacefully marched from Johnson Square to City Hall. “We need to make sure that we stop apologizing and we move from apology to action,” Savannah Police Chief Roy Minter said. At one point during Mayor Van Johnson’s speech, the crowd broke into a chant of “arrest the other three,” referring to other Minneapolis police officers who stood by while an officer knelt on Floyd’s neck. “Yeah, they should arrest the other three,” Johnson said. “We are tired of the mess and we want it to stop now. We stand here as a united community to say that we are standing with George Floyd and his family, because no man should ever have to die like that,” Johnson said. “We stand here united as a community to say that crooked police officers are called criminals. And in jail, they should be.” – Will Peebles, Dennis Knight, Mary Landers, Nathan Dominitz and Zach Dennis, Savannah Morning News San Diego: Police fire tear gas after being assaulted by rocks and bottles San Diego Police said they fired tear gas canisters Sunday after rocks and bottles were thrown at them. The department said in a series of tweets that the confrontation was taking place at Second Avenue and Broadway in the seaside city's downtown. ""Certain protestors continue to throw objects and vandalize our city,"" the department said in one post. ""The criminal behavior of these few is unacceptable. We are continuing to order the crowd to disperse."" Earlier, however, the department praised the peacefulness of most demonstrators. But it said it had to issue the order to disperse because of the dangerous actions of a few. At one point, demonstrators occupied Interstate 5, stopping traffic in both directions, the San Diego Union-Tribune reported. Philadelphia: Mayor Jim Kenney 'saddened and disappointed' beyond words Another day of street protests gave way to looting, with at least one police vehicle set on fire. Looters were running out of stores in the northeastern section of the city with armloads of merchandise. In the downtown, workers and volunteers swept up broken glass from windows shattered during riots the previous day. Graffiti was being removed. Mayor Jim Kenney said the mayhem “saddened and disappointed me beyond words, and I’m sure it saddened every Philadelphian who takes pride in their city.” He said those responsible “not only desecrated private businesses, they also desecrated the important message that was heard in the earlier peaceful protests.” Spartanburg, South Carolina: Passing motorists show support for protesters Chanting “No justice, no peace,” about 100 peaceful Spartanburg, South Carolina, protesters gathered at Barnet Park, drawing support from motorists who honked their car horns. “We want to take a peaceful stand to show support,” said organizer Kelvin Brown. “If we can all come together as a people, black and white, we can make a difference.” Many protesters said it wasn’t just Floyd’s death at the hand of a white police officer, or that it took days before the officer was arrested, that triggered anger. “We need to end the racist system,” said Curtis Pickens. “If you want all this to stop, real justice is what is needed. Stop the racial and social profiling. Stop hiring white supremacist officers.” “It’s time to stand up for what we believe in,” Isaiah Jordan said. “What happened to George Floyd terrorizes the whole nation. We’ve got to do something about it. I’m just sick and tired of young, black men dying."" --Bob Montgomery, GoUpstate.com Lafayette, Louisiana: Protesters want police to know 'we're human' Hundreds of protesters, some wearing protective face coverings, lined Lafayette streets to join a peaceful demonstration against police brutality. The protest, peaceful like others in Baton Rouge and New Orleans this weekend, began in the morning with protesters lining the streets to chant. “I am sick and tired of being sick and tired,” Lafayette NAACP President Marja Broussard said to protesters. “I have a message for law enforcement. The message is: we want you to know that we’re human just like you...We want you to know we have families. We’re human.” – William Taylor Potter, Lafayette Daily Advertiser Augusta, Georgia: Demonstrators chant 'No justice, no peace' Demonstrators chanted “no justice, no peace” as they walked along Washington Road in Augusta, Georgia. While “No justice, no peace,” was a popular chant among protesters, Sunday’s peaceful march was about showing strength through peace rather than through violence, organizers said. Latoya Lovett said she asked the Street Justice Council to help her organize the marches after hearing many Augusta residents talk about going to Atlanta to join protests there, which have turned violent after peaceful starts. “You can march in your own city, you can have a voice in your own city,” Lovett said. “You don’t have to go smash windows, you don’t have to go beat people, you don’t have to drop on the police.” Demonstrators were escorted by Richmond County Sheriff’s Office deputies who blocked off roads and intersections as needed. Sheriff Richard Roundtree was among those who helped guide the marchers and ensure safety for both them and the motorists. “We believe in free speech and protesting and voicing your opinion, as long as you do it in a safe manner,” Roundtree said. “As long as you’re doing that, we’re all for it.” – Will Cheney and Miguel Legoas, The Augusta Chronicle Jacksonville, Florida: Peaceful rally follows violent Saturday night of protests A peaceful demonstration was held Sunday outside the Duval County Courthouse. Then protesters started moving downtown and Jacksonville, Florida, police worked to keep them in certain areas. The cleanup of smashed store windows began Sunday around Florida after a night of unrest throughout the state’s cities. Jacksonville Sheriff Mike Williams said an unnamed deputy was either stabbed or slashed in the neck and was taken to a hospital for treatment Saturday night. A sheriff’s office spokeswoman would not comment on the deputy’s condition Sunday morning. A protest Saturday resulted in many arrests, “but we still don’t know how many or anything related to those arrests,” the sheriff said. – Sarasota News-Tribune Cincinnati: Police make 100 arrests after urging protesters to go home Police arrested as many as 100 people after using tear gas and imploring the crowd to go home ahead of a curfew. It ended a day that earlier featured a large crowd gathered at Inwood Park in Cincinnati to hear speakers as a rally, followed by a march. Organizers gave instructions about what to do if they are tear-gassed. The rally started with a fist-up salute and a song about the death Sam DuBose, shot by a police officer not far from the scene of this protest in 2015. Some Cincinnati City Council members tweeted from the rally. – Sarah Brookbank, Cincinnati Enquirer Contributing: The Associated Press",0.0

1622526351,2020-06-01 12:10:10,George Floyd. Ahmaud Arbery. Breonna Taylor. What do we tell our children?,https://www.hockessincommunitynews.com/zz/news/20200601/george-floyd-ahmaud-arbery-breonna-taylor-what-do-we-tell-our-children?rssfeed=true,en,False,,348142,hockessincommunitynews.com,http://hockessincommunitynews.com/,"Should we tell the children? How? Those are among the many questions parents are asking after the recent deaths of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor. Many white parents wonder whether to talk with their kids at all, while parents of color swallow their grief and fear to have ""the talk"" once again. These deaths are part of a more complex story, one some parents have been telling for generations, and others have long felt they've had the luxury to ignore. But experts in child psychology and race-based stress say these conversations are essential for all parents to have, and they underscore that there are developmentally appropriate ways to talk to children of all ages about racism and police brutality. ""Silence will not protect you or them,"" said Beverly Daniel Tatum, a psychologist and author of, Why Are All The Black Kids Sitting Together in the Cafeteria? And Other Conversations About Race. ""Avoiding the topic is not a solution."" Racism persists, experts say, because many parents avoid difficult conversations. ""One of the most important things to remember is that you may not have all the answers and that is OK,"" said Erlanger Turner, a clinical psychologist and assistant professor of psychology at Pepperdine University who studies mental health among racial communities. USA TODAY spoke with Tatum and Turner about how to talk with children about racial violence: Why is it important to talk with children about what happened to George Floyd and other incidents of police brutality or racism in the news? Beverly Daniel Tatum: Even young children may see or hear about highly publicized incidents like the George Floyd case – perhaps overhearing the TV or the radio – and may ask questions. Or if parents are upset by the news, the child may perceive the parent’s distress and ask why mom or dad is upset. In either case, an age-appropriate explanation is better than silence. Older children with Internet access may see online images on their own. Initiating an age-appropriate conversation can give children a helpful frame for understanding difficult realities. If parents are silent, children will draw their own often faulty conclusions about what is happening and why. Erlanger Turner: Many adults are hurt and angered by these events and their children may notice changes in their mood. It is helpful to have a healthy conversation around what happened and also talk about ways to cope when you witness social injustice. Does COVID-19 warrant avoiding these conversations, given many children are already struggling with fear, anxiety and uncertainty? BDT: No. Not talking about upsetting events only fuels fear, anxiety and uncertainty. Being able to talk about something with a supportive adult can reduce fear, anxiety and uncertainty. Parents may avoid the conversation because they don’t know what to say, but it is a mistake to think that their silence is helpful. ET: I don't think that anxiety and fear about COVID-19 should stop a parent from talking about police brutality. This issue has been increasing in concern over the last few years as the number of black and brown people killed by police continue to rise. I think if you do talk with your child don't leave them in a high state of worry. Make sure to end the conversation by engaging in a pleasant activity after the difficult discussion so they won't stay worried or afraid. How do parents start these conversations and how does that change depending on the age of their children? ET: I think the first place to start a conversation around racism and police brutality is with honesty. Take ownership of your feelings and be comfortable sharing those feelings with your child. Then you can begin to allow them to share what they may already know about racial differences. I think that it is always good to allow children to share their opinion and understanding before you offer information. For younger children conversations about racism should be limited to basic facts about how people are treated differently due to the color of their skin but also acknowledge that not everyone treats people differently based on race. For older teens, parents can consider exposure to news or social media posts as discussion points about this issue. BDT: Regardless of the age of the child, it is important to balance acknowledging the reality of racism, or unfairness, with messages about the possibility of change, and the community of allies who are working together to make things better. If a child of color asks if a police officer is going to kill them, what do you say? BDT: The answer will depend on the age of the child. If it is a young child, a parent can be reassuring. “No, honey, you don’t have to worry about that. Police officers don’t want to hurt you.” In response to an older child, it can be reassuring to say something like: ""I know that it is scary to think that something like that might happen, and I really don’t want you to worry about anything like that. I know that most police officers want to help people, and most police officers never fire their guns. But sometimes they do get nervous and make mistakes. So it is important for you to know what to do if a police officer ever stops you…” Black parents often refer to this as “the talk” they have to have with their adolescent sons to increase the odds they will survive an encounter with a police officer if and when they are stopped. ET: That is a tough question. Depending on the age of the child, they may have some awareness of youth that have been killed by police. Obviously you don't want to respond in a way that is going to make children be more fearful for their safety. In my opinion, I think that you should let children know that most police officers work to protect them and their community. If a child says they are afraid or angry, what do you say? BDT: Acknowledge the child’s feelings. The parent may have similar feelings. “I know it’s upsetting to hear about and see these things happening. It upsets me too when bad things like this happen. Racism is very unfair. But it makes me feel better to know there are lots of people who want to change things."" Being able to offer specific examples of community change agents would be useful. Being able to talk about what family members are doing to speak up against unfairness is especially useful. Actions always speak louder than words. ET: If a child tells you that they are angry, that is appropriate. Don't force them to hide their emotional expression. However, be sure to help them identify ways to express their anger in a healthy manner which may include journaling or exercising to release the energy from their body. If a child is afraid for one of their friends, what do you say? BDT: “I can see that you are worried about your friend. What do you think we could do that might help him or her?” Depending on the situation, this could be an opportunity to talk about what it means to be an ally, and how to stand in solidarity with another person. ET: If a child is afraid for one of their friends, talk with them about those emotions. Allow the child to express why they may be afraid and help them identify how they can check on their friend's safety to ease their anxiety or fear. Part of what increases anxiety is the fear of the unknown. If you have a plan of action it will reduce some of those fears. How can parents talk about law enforcement in a way that is honest but also doesn’t discourage children from seeking help from law enforcement when appropriate? BDT: Most police officers become police officers because they want to help people. And there are times when we would really want a police officer to help us – give some examples – if there’s been a car accident, or if someone took something that belonged to us, etc. But sometimes a police officer does something bad, like today. When that happens, we might start to think that all police officers are like that. But it’s important to remember that that is not true. ET: I think that it is very important to talk with the children about law enforcement. For example, you can talk with them about how they protect rules in society such as making sure that people don't drive too fast so they won't harm themselves or others. Providing clear examples about the ways that law enforcement helps society will allow the child to better understand. You can also be honest about situations such as police brutality and let children know that some police officers break laws. If you have a trusted officer in your community it may be good to also allow the child to talk with them in person to reduce their fear. Should these conversations be different depending on the race of the child? BDT: Children of color are likely to experience racist encounters as they get older. They need to be helped to understand their own worth and feel affirmed in their identity as young people of color despite the negative messages they may get from others. Parents of color want to raise self-confident and empowered children who are not demoralized by other people’s racism. This requires lots of conversation about racism and how to resist it in an ongoing way throughout their children’s lives. White children are often racially isolated as a consequence of segregated schools and neighborhoods, and consequently limited in their understanding of people different from themselves. White parents who want to interrupt the cycle of racism must learn to talk to their children about it and model their own anti-racist activity. ET: According to research, white parents often don't talk with their children about race or may emphasize ""not seeing color."" The concept of colorblindness or ""not seeing color"" is more harmful than helpful and does not honor an individual's identity. ... For white families, research suggests ... conversations should focus on raising anti-racist children and encouraging more friendships with children from others races. Many of these deaths garner attention because footage of it goes viral. What should we say if our child asks to see it? BDT: There are many adults who don’t want to see such footage. I would not show it to a child at all. Once an image is in your head, it is very difficult to get it out. That said, it is reasonable to describe what happened and talk about why it was wrong. It is also likely that children with Internet access can view the footage without an adult’s permission or assistance. Talking about it after the fact will help children process their feelings. ET: You should not show your children these videos as it may increase the likelihood of them experiencing symptoms of trauma or having nightmares. What we know from research on witnessing disasters is that individuals may be at a higher risk of developing post-traumatic stress disorder even through indirect exposure to these events. What do we say if, in the course of this conversation, a child says something racist? BDT: Inquire about it with curiosity, not judgment. ""I’m wondering why you said that…"" After hearing more about what the child is thinking, you can offer correction by providing new information. “You know, a lot of people might think that is true, but I don’t because….” ET: I think the first thing to do is to not get defensive. You want to foster open communication with your child. However, I think you should explore why they have that opinion, where did they learn it from, and tell them why what they said was wrong. It might be helpful for you as a parent to think about ways that you may have unconsciously expressed racist attitudes. How can parents explain the uprisings in a way that doesn’t condone violence but also doesn't minimize the sense of injustice fueling them? BDT: Children understand the concept of unfairness as well as the experience of frustration. Years and years of unfairness – racism – results in intense anger and frustration. The conversation can then be about what we must do to fix the continuing unfairness. ET: I think it is important for parents to be honest. Share your hurt, anger, or disappointment with your child. You should also talk about different ways to protest social injustice such as calling your local politicians office or even visit their office to talk with them about policy change to reduce injustice.

Jack Manderscheid, a University of Minnesota senior, exemplified the spirit of the day by meticulously walking through the Uptown neighborhood filling up four trash bags that he carried on his bicycle. “I’ve never really seen a community come together,” said Manderscheid, a native of suburban Edina who woke up Sunday intent on finding one gesture to help put the city. There have been five nights of anguished protests following the Monday death of George Floyd, a black man whose neck was knelt on for nearly nine minutes by Derek Chauvin, a white police officer. Manderscheid had attended a demonstration earlier in the week, but the fumes from tear gas used by police officers bothered him. So had the large crowds during a time when he is trying to keep his distance from people over fears of spreading the new coronavirus. He instead decided to clean the streets and sidewalks, only to find that hundreds of others had the same idea. “The longer this goes on, the more I realize I’m going to remember this the rest of my life,” Manderscheid said. Meanwhile, Dan Halvorsen picked up trash and swept away debris along with seven other members of his church in suburban Bloomington. “We wanted to perform a good deed. Our hearts are just breaking about this whole situation,” he said. “By the time we got here, the response has been so amazing, that there wasn’t a big need for us.” Other residents found a way to help by providing food, diapers and other essentials in a city where most stores and restaurants are closed. That’s how Tracy Gray Knutson found herself an unwitting, but perfectly willing, Santa Claus of sorts. Knutson, 40, sat down on a chair on the sidewalk outside a boarded-up Franklin Avenue café, planning to rest her sunburned feet. Above her, a large sign read: “Free Food and Stuff.” Residents of the south Minneapolis neighborhood surveyed the scene and decided that Knutson was in charge of a popup pantry. Soon, they descended on her with sacks of bread, beans and other groceries, plus diapers, bottled water and even more garbage bags ready to be filled. Knutson, who said she is recently homeless, enjoyed giving the goods away to a line of people who politely approached her, asking if it was really free. “Anything you want, brother. Take anything,” she implored one hesitant man. “I love you.” A few blocks away on Franklin Avenue, an east-west thoroughfare lined with stores that now sit empty, Alan Gross oversaw an impromptu food shelf that quickly resembled a warehouse. Gross, 52, jokingly called himself a barista/counselor/bouncer at two businesses that share a building: Powwow Grounds Coffee and All My Relations Gallery. The latter is a large space that typically displays American Indian art. It was shuttered in March after the COVID-19 threat forced the closure of museums and galleries in Minnesota. The art has been relocated, although Gross hopes to reopen soon. On Sunday, the floor was rapidly filling with food brought in by the carload from people eager to help. It all happened over the course of 72 hours, after word went out on Facebook that the gallery would serve as a distribution point for groceries in the neighborhood. Gross was surprised by the amount of donated food but philosophical about the motivation of his fellow Minnesotans. “Pitching in, believing that there’s a better way to do things, I think that’s the draw,” he said. “Everyone’s got to have a cause.”",0.0

The protests over George Floyd's death hit the nation's capital Friday night as angry protesters arrived at Pennsylvania Avenue, leading to a lockdown at the White House. Outside the White House on Friday, Secret Service could be seen after 7 p.m. taking at least one person into custody. Videos showed a large group of protesters gathering, with some burning flags and knocking over barricades. There were also some violent encounters. The president remained there about an hour before returning to the residence, according to a Republican close to the White House and an administration official who spoke to the Associated Press on the condition of anonymity. It is currently unknown whether first lady Melania Trump and their son, Barron, were with the president but the family has been shaken by the size and venom of the crowds, AP reported. ""The White House does not comment on security protocols and decisions,” said White House spokesman Judd Deere. The Secret Service said it does not discuss the means and methods of its protective operations. Officials told The New York Times, which first reported the story, they never believed Trump was in danger but took the precaution of moving him to the bunker as tensions escalated. Trump has told advisers he worries about his safety, while both privately and publicly praising the work of the Secret Service, according to the AP. Floyd, an unarmed black man, died in Minneapolis police custody this week after a white officer pinned him to the ground under his knee. His death has sparked demonstrations against police brutality and racial discrimination in cities across the United States. Trump praised the Secret Service and said he “watched every move” from inside the White House during Friday's protest and that he “couldn't have felt more safe.” ""They let the ‘protesters’ scream & rant as much as they wanted, but whenever someone got too frisky or out of line, they would quickly come down on them, hard – didn’t know what hit them,"" he said Saturday. Trump continued, ""The front line was replaced with fresh agents, like magic. Big crowd, professionally organized, but nobody came close to breaching the fence. If they had, they would have been greeted with the most vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons, I have ever seen. That’s when people would have been really badly hurt, at least."" He also claimed DC Mayor Muriel Bowser didn't allow DC police to ""get involved"" and assist Secret Service, though Secret Service later said they were on the scene. Bowser, a Democrat, said on Twitter the city's police department would protect everyone regardless of whether the mayor agreed with them. ""While he hides behind his fence afraid/alone, I stand w/ people peacefully exercising their First Amendment Right after the murder of #GeorgeFloyd & hundreds of years of institutional racism There are no vicious dogs & ominous weapons. There is just a scared man,"" she wrote.

DPS continued to tweet about arrests late into the night and added, ""Even peaceful protesters who are breaking curfew are subject to arrest. Please go home and stay there."" DPS announced the arrests of more than 155 people Saturday night across multiple agencies. A dozen firearms were confiscated between the State Patrol and the Minneapolis Police Department. Historic St. John's Church near White House set ablaze amid DC protests As protesters gathered near the White House, flames were seen at Washington, D.C., landmark that bills itself as ""the church of the presidents."" The fire, apparently an act of arson, was in the basement of St. John's Church, across from the White House, The Washington Post reported, and was extinguished. It occurred as a demonstration was taking place outside. The gathering had attracted as many as 1,000 Sunday, who faced off against officers in riot gear. The Episcopalian church in Lafayette Square boasts on its website that every U.S. president since James Madison has attended services. Consecrated in 1816, the church also says the bell in its steeple, weighing almost 1,000 pounds, was cast in 1822 by Paul Revere's son Joseph.

Speaking at the site where Floyd died after fired police officer Derek Chauvin held his knee to Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes, Arradondo apologized to Floyd's family and said he had a ""visceral"" and ""emotional"" reaction to the video that has sparked outrage across the nation. “There are absolute truths in life,"" Arradondo told CNN. ""We need air to breathe. ... I did not need days or weeks or months or processes or bureaucracies to tell me what occurred out here last Monday, it was wrong.” When asked why he fired the four officers involved in the incident that led to Floyd's death, Arradondo said: ""In my mind, this was a violation of humanity. This was a violation of the oath the majority of the men and women that put this uniform on — this goes absolutely against it. This goes contrary to what we believe in.""

One of the people opens a door to the SUV and those at the scene start lighting things inside of it on fire. Police eventually got to the scene and began pushing back protesters as the vehicles burned behind them. Minnesota AG Keith Ellison to lead prosecution of Derek Chauvin Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz announced Sunday that state Attorney General Keith Ellison will lead the prosecution in the Floyd case. Ellison called the case “unusual because of the way that Mr. Floyd was killed and who did it — at the hands of the defendant who was a Minneapolis police officer.” He said he expects to work together with Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman on the case. Ellison didn’t announce additional charges for Chauvin or charges for the three other officers involved in the incident. He added “prosecuting police officers for misconduct, including homicide and murder, is very difficult.” “Every single link in the prosecutorial chain will come under attack as we present this case to a jury or a fact finder and we need to make sure that we be absolutely prepared.

""My business burned down two days ago, you see the flames? It's still going,"" Moore, 41, said Sunday. ""That flame down in people's soul? It's still going. They want justice."" She is among dozens of Minneapolis and St. Paul business owners, small and large, trying to rebuild after fiery riots and demonstrations in the Twin Cities on Thursday and Friday. Her company, ""Levels,"" which also has a St. Paul location that remains undamaged, was Moore's ""baby."" Moore, a black woman, said she started the business from the trunk of her car once she left a job with Minneapolis Public Schools in 2011 to pursue her passion for fashion and music. It had been opened for five years before people broke in Friday and started a fire that destroyed her business and several adjacent stores. When she was alerted to the break-in, Moore went to Lake Street and watched nearly a decade of work collapse into the concrete. ""I'm hurt that I lost this. But ... I can't cry right now,"" she said. ""I can't go home and cry and be hurt because I lost businesses. George Floyd lost his life. He'll never be here again."" She's confident she can recover but isn't sure if she can rebuild at the same location — in the heart of a diverse southside neighborhood. A GoFundMe has been started to help with those expenses. Other small businesses face similar uncertainty, but several fundraisers have been started to help support Minneapolis' littlest companies. As looters ransacked his St. Paul store, this business owner hid in the bathroom and whispered to 911 In St. Paul's Midway neighborhood, just blocks from where Moore's second Levels location was protected by armed men standing on its porch, one business owner said he hid in his office as people ransacked, urinated in and damaged the building. Jim Segal closed Ax-Man Surplus earlier than normal Thursday afternoon because daylight looting took hold at the nearby intersection of University and Snelling avenues. After sending customers and employees home and locking the front door, Segal said he continued to work in the office of the six-decade-old company. Then he heard multiple glass windows break. ""Luckily, I have a steel door because they were trying to enter the office,"" said Segal, who bought the surplus store about 20 years ago. ""I don't think they knew anybody was in there, but I basically barricaded myself within a bathroom inside the office."" He felt as if he were in a movie, the St. Paul native said. As display cases were shattered and electronics taken from inside his store, he whispered to 911 dispatch asking for help. ""Police said, 'Don't even bother boarding up your store,'"" Segal said Saturday. ""'There's a 50/50 chance it won't be here tomorrow."" About 6:30 p.m. Thursday, he returned to the St. Paul Ax-Man location, one of three in the metro, in an unsuccessful effort to shoo away people running in and out of his store. A company agreed to board up his windows, Segal said, but left quickly after arriving, not wanting to work amongst the crowd. He tried to get a license plate of someone stealing, but others tried to take his phone so he retreated to his car. Segal sat in his vehicle for hours as rioters peed in his store and took items ranging from knick-knacks and DVDs to a snow-blower. He said coronavirus concerns forced him to close his business for the better part of two months. They'd been reopened a little more than a week when the building was ransacked. ""I don't recall ever being in a situation where I was that panicked. I was petrified, actually,"" he said. Ax-Man won't reopen for at least a week or two, and Segal fears it may close permanently because of the lack of sales during the spring. That would mean a loss of livelihood for him and about 10 employees. He sympathizes with those upset about Floyd's death in police custody on Memorial Day, describing the video of Minneapolis police officers' actions ""horrific."" ""This is just stuff, no comparison (to a person dying),"" said Segal, a white man. ""But what I'm disappointed about is the lack of leadership in the government — Mayor (Melvin) Carter, Mayor (Jacob) Frey, Gov. (Tim) Walz — to just allow lawlessness. ""Indefensible what happened to Mr. Floyd, but this doesn't make it better. And I don't know what does."" Insurance helps small business owners, but a full recovery is 'a lot more complicated' While Moore and Segal both said they are insured, they don't believe insurance alone will enough to replace everything they've lost. People typically see business owner and think ""wealth,"" Segal said. ""That's not true for me,"" he said. ""I'm the last one to get paid."" Understanding insurance policies can be difficult for many small business owners, said Allison Sharkey, executive director of the Lake Street Council, which supports local companies. Lake Street has always been an area for Minneapolis's immigrant entrepreneurs to start businesses, she said, and many of those folks may not be familiar with aid systems or insurance proceedings. ""There's a lot of detail to go through in your contract that most people don't really understand until a situation like this happens,"" Sharkey said. ""It's a lot more complicated than just paying a $500 deductible and thinking the rest is going to be covered."" Minority business owners may not have the credit or assets to withstand closures as long as white business owners with more resources, she said. The council, and other metro business associations like it, try to fill that gap and provide guidance, but insurance claims won't stop some businesses from completely fading away. For Moore, she's frustrated when people bring up the fact she's insured because it ignores the work she put into the building and the items she won't get back. ""When you get it out the mud — meaning when you get it on your own, no handouts ... someone just handing you money doesn't equate,"" she said. ""It's deeper than that."" Financial support is coming for Twin Cities small businesses left in rubble amid George Floyd protests When Segal returned to his business Friday, he found a person who lived nearby sweeping glass from the sidewalk, which raised his spirits. Monetary support has begun, too. It's especially vital, small business advocates say, because many companies were already running out of money because of closures due to COVID-19. The Lake Street Council has received over $1.5 million to help support the hundreds of businesses that line the heavily damaged area. Sharkey said companies owned by people of color and immigrants have been especially affected by the days of unrest. Several ""big, beautiful"" buildings on the southside have been replaced by rubble, which will be eventually replaced by vacant lots. ""($1.5 million) sounds like a big number, but we're gonna need a lot more government and nonprofit support,"" Sharkey said. ""We have a long road ahead of us."" She said her organization had already begun to save money to distribute to companies dealing with financial contractions from the coronavirus, but it's not been shifted to riot recovery. The council will request an aid package from the state, but Sharkey thinks they'll need federal dollars as well. ""We're headed toward a recession,"" she said. ""We're really going to have to create a long-term strategy along with stakeholders, business owners, property owners business groups, elected officials."" Donations to that fund can be made here. Fundraising has begun in Segal's area, as well. The Hamline Midway Coalition has received more than $75,000 to help aid small businesses in their recovery from property damage and lost sales. Kate Mudge, the coalition's director, said the organization has been raising funds to help small and minority business owners worried about gentrification and corporatization coming with the new U.S. soccer stadium built nearby. ""We already have been dealing with a pandemic, we've been dealing with some long-term issues in our community, and this is the icing on the cake. We hope that this is gonna bring new people to Midway, new businesses,"" she said. ""We've dealt with worse."" Donations to the Midway fund can be made at here. Despite the uncertainty, the organizations are confident many businesses will survive if community support keeps up. ""I'm not blaming people, you can't judge anybody's pain or anger. Everyone acts and reacts to things in different ways,"" Moore said. ""I have a black-owned business, it was burned down and we were protesting, for a black man's life that was taken. So, I was just a little confused on where we're going with this. But, at the end of the day, everything is about sacrifices.""",0.0
1622542167,2020-06-01 10:51:55,What is antifa and what does the movement want?,https://www.scsuntimes.com/zz/news/20200601/what-is-antifa-and-what-does-movement-want?rssfeed=true,en,False,,371176,scsuntimes.com,http://scsuntimes.com/,"Antifa — short for ""anti-fascist"" — is the name for loosely affiliated, left-leaning anti-racist groups that monitor and track the activities of local neo-Nazis. The movement has no unified structure or national leadership but has emerged in the form of local bodies nationwide, particularly on the West Coast. Some of the groups, such as the 10-year-old Rose City Antifa in Portland, the oldest antifa group in the U.S., are particularly well-organized and active online and on Facebook, while its members are individually anonymous. President Trump has singled out antifa as part of what he calls the alt-left in his initial claim that ""many sides"" were to blame for violence in Charlottesville the weekend of Aug. 12, not just the neo-Nazis, KKK and white nationalists. How is it pronounced? ""AN-tifa"" with the emphasis on the first syllable, which sounds more like ""on"" in English than ""an."" When did it start? Anti-fascist groups, particularly in Europe, have been around for many decades, notably in Italy, against Mussolini, and in Germany, against Hitler. In the postwar period, antifa groups resurged to fight neo-Nazi groups, particularly in Germany. In the U.S., the anti-fascist movements grew out of leftist politics of the late '80s, primarily under the umbrella of Anti-Racist Action. What does the movement want? The primary goal is to stop neo-Nazis and white supremacists from gaining a platform rather than to promote a specific antifa agenda. The antifa groups are decidedly anti-racist, anti-sexist and anti-homophobia, but also by and large socially leftist and anti-capitalist. How do the groups operate? Mark Bray, a lecturer and Dartmouth and author of the new book Antifa: The Antifascist Handbook, says the groups ""organize educational campaigns, build community coalitions, monitor fascists, pressure venues to cancel their events, organize self-defense trainings and physically confront the far right when necessary."" A main goal is to try to deny fascists a public forum, which is why they turn out in numbers to physically confront neo-Nazis, the KKK and white supremacists at public demonstrations. They also step in to protect counter-protesters at such events. In addition, antifa is particularly active in ""doxxing,"" or identifying neo-Nazis and like-minded individuals and disseminating that private information to the public and employers to discourage people from joining their ranks. Is antifa violent? Members pointedly do not eschew violence but rather see themselves as engaging in ""self-defense,"" protecting other protesters and primarily confronting neo-Nazis and white supremacists to deny them a platform to publicly spread their views. ""We are unapologetic about the reality that fighting fascism at points requires physical militancy,” Rose City Antifa’s Facebook page reads. “Anti-fascism is, by nature, a form of self-defense: the goal of fascism is to exterminate the vast majority of human beings.” Political activist and author Cornel West, speaking to Amy Goodman on the program Democracy Now about the clashes in Charlottesville, said antifa intervened when the ""neofascists"" move against his group of protesters. ""We would have been crushed like cockroaches if it were not for the anarchists and the anti-fascists,"" he said. Bray says the rise of fascism in the 1930s demonstrates that it was a mistake to allow such groups to air their views in hopes that public opinion would blunt their growth. ""We should be wary of those who are more distressed about alleged violations of the speech of fascists than the actual violence they perpetrate,"" he says. Where has the movement demonstrated? In addition to Charlottesville, antifa forces, who often dress in black and wear masks, have confronted or clashed with far-right groups in such places as the University of California at Berkeley, where protests by West Coast antifa forces, some of whom smashed windows and set fires, forced the cancellation of a speech by alt-right activist Milo Yiannopoulos in February and another by conservative commentator Ann Coulter in April. In June, antifa forces turned out to protest a pro-Trump free-speech in Portland. Some antifa counterprotesters began throwing objects at police, who responded with flash grenades and pepper balls, according to the The Oregonian. Antifa was also out in force in June to confront Patriot Prayer, a free speech group protesting “political correctness and hatred” at Evergreen State College in Olympia, Wash.",0.0
1622542160,2020-06-01 11:35:39,"It's time to stand up': Peaceful demonstrations, looting and chanting on sixth night of George Floyd protests",https://www.scsuntimes.com/zz/news/20200601/its-time-to-stand-up-peaceful-demonstrations-looting-and-chanting-on-sixth-night-of-george-floyd-protests?rssfeed=true,en,False,,371176,scsuntimes.com,http://scsuntimes.com/,"Protesters marched in the streets again Sunday across the U.S. to call for reforms after the death of George Floyd, an unarmed black man who died in police custody on Memorial Day in Minneapolis. Most demonstrations, some attracting hundreds of people, were peaceful though violence, including the burning of police vehicles and looting, prompted police in some cities to deploy tear gas to gain control of the crowd. Early in the day, volunteers turned out in many cities to sweep up debris from businesses that had been burned, had their windows broken or were otherwise damaged Saturday. Here's a look at how protests are unfolding around the country on Sunday: Washington, D.C.: Historic St. John's Church near White House set ablaze As protesters gathered near the White House, flames were seen at the Washington, D.C., landmark that bills itself as ""the church of the presidents."" The fire, apparently an act of arson, was in the basement of St. John's Church, across from the White House, The Washington Post reported, and was extinguished. It occurred as a demonstration was taking place outside. The gathering had attracted as many as 1,000 Sunday, who faced off against officers in riot gear. The Episcopalian church in Lafayette Square boasts on its website that every U.S. president since James Madison has attended services there. Consecrated in 1816, the church also says the bell in its steeple, weighing almost 1,000 pounds, was cast in 1822 by Paul Revere's son Joseph. New York City: Protesters force closure of Manhattan Bridge; street fires, looting A crucial bridge into Manhattan was closed Sunday to make way for protesters, a day after hundreds of arrests including the mayor's daughter, it was reported. Street fires were being set and sporadic looting was reported Sunday evening after a day that saw large groups of protesters walk from Brooklyn to Manhattan over the Manhattan Bridge, which had to be closed, ABC7 in New York reported. Mayor Bill de Blasio's daughter Chiara, 25, was among 345 arrested, the station reported based on unnamed NYPD sources. The Daily Mail said it was able to confirm the arrest from a police report. She was reportedly arrested as part of a group of 100 demonstrators who refused to leave a roadway when ordered by police. Seattle: National Guard called to Bellevue; protesters block Interstate 5 National Guard troops were ordered to the Seattle suburb of Bellevue after reports of widespread looting. Washington Gov. Jay Inslee ordered 200 National Guard members to Bellevue after the mayor declared an emergency due to violence. Rioters broke into the Bellevue Mall and were stealing goods from stores. The thefts were part of a day of protests in the Seattle area that included shutting down Interstate 5, the same freeway that San Diego demonstrators blocked more than 1,000 miles away in southern California. Chicago: Gov. JB Pritzker activates National Guardsmen to assist police Vandalism reports continued to crop up in several city neighborhoods and some suburbs. The communities of Tinley Park, Crestwood and Oak Lawn alerted residents to stay home due to civil unrest. Many businesses boarded up. Gov. J.B. Pritzker said he activated 375 Illinois National Guard soldiers to assist local law enforcement with street closures. The downtown Chicago demonstrations that drew thousands started peacefully Saturday afternoon in a plaza, with protesters reading the names of black people who have died at the hands of police. But that gave way to violence and destruction that continued overnight Sunday in Chicago and elsewhere. Police used batons to beat back demonstrators as police cars were set ablaze and windows were smashed at businesses ranging from neighborhood convenience stores to high-end Michigan Avenue shops. Santa Monica, California: Unchecked looting as marchers confront police Looters took advantage of a large demonstration several blocks away to hit stores in the city's business district. In late afternoon, police were met with resistance when they tried to end a demonstration that had been peaceful. Demonstrators constructed a makeshift barricade in the middle of a street to protect themselves from non-lethal rounds fired by officers. The march had attracted hundreds along the city's main oceanfront boulevard. Though there were many police officers present for the march, looters were able to plunder stores with few to stop them. Cars were seen pulling up in front of stores, with looters running in to collect bundles of clothes and other merchandise, then running out. Boxes littered the sidewalk as thieves were seen transferring goods into plastic trash bags. A 5:30 p.m. PST curfew was announced due to the protests. The looting came despite the arrival of the National Guard troops in neighboring Los Angeles, which had seen extensive looting, vandalism and arson on Saturday. Murfreesboro, Tennessee: Brick thrown into business, police use tear gas A small but tense demonstration in Murfreesboro, Tennessee, appeared to have dispersed after demonstrators blocked traffic and threw a brick through the window of a local business, prompting police to respond with canisters of tear gas. About 50 protesters, many of whom appeared to be Middle Tennessee State University students, marched from Main Street toward Forrest Hall, a campus building named for Confederate general and Ku Klux Klan founder Nathan Bedford Forrest. Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee said protests in Murfreesboro are now “overt threats to public safety and property.” Police said an armored vehicle was vandalized and protesters have blocked traffic by lying in the street in an intersection. Officers responded by throwing canisters of tear gas to drive protesters out of the street. However, before the protest escalated, negotiations between police and protest leaders led to calm, then students and officers were seen walking together and posing for photos. – Nancy DeGennaro, Joseph Spears, Mealand Ragland-Hudgins and Brinley Hineman, Murfreesboro Daily News Journal Savannah, Georgia: Protesters chant 'Arrest the other three' during rally Thousands demonstrated against racism and the killings of black people at the hands of police Sunday in Savannah, Georgia. City leaders joined protesters who peacefully marched from Johnson Square to City Hall. “We need to make sure that we stop apologizing and we move from apology to action,” Savannah Police Chief Roy Minter said. At one point during Mayor Van Johnson’s speech, the crowd broke into a chant of “arrest the other three,” referring to other Minneapolis police officers who stood by while an officer knelt on Floyd’s neck. “Yeah, they should arrest the other three,” Johnson said. “We are tired of the mess and we want it to stop now. We stand here as a united community to say that we are standing with George Floyd and his family, because no man should ever have to die like that,” Johnson said. “We stand here united as a community to say that crooked police officers are called criminals. And in jail, they should be.” – Will Peebles, Dennis Knight, Mary Landers, Nathan Dominitz and Zach Dennis, Savannah Morning News San Diego: Police fire tear gas after being assaulted by rocks and bottles San Diego Police said they fired tear gas canisters Sunday after rocks and bottles were thrown at them. The department said in a series of tweets that the confrontation was taking place at Second Avenue and Broadway in the seaside city's downtown. ""Certain protestors continue to throw objects and vandalize our city,"" the department said in one post. ""The criminal behavior of these few is unacceptable. We are continuing to order the crowd to disperse."" Earlier, however, the department praised the peacefulness of most demonstrators. But it said it had to issue the order to disperse because of the dangerous actions of a few. At one point, demonstrators occupied Interstate 5, stopping traffic in both directions, the San Diego Union-Tribune reported. Philadelphia: Mayor Jim Kenney 'saddened and disappointed' beyond words Another day of street protests gave way to looting, with at least one police vehicle set on fire. Looters were running out of stores in the northeastern section of the city with armloads of merchandise. In the downtown, workers and volunteers swept up broken glass from windows shattered during riots the previous day. Graffiti was being removed. Mayor Jim Kenney said the mayhem “saddened and disappointed me beyond words, and I’m sure it saddened every Philadelphian who takes pride in their city.” He said those responsible “not only desecrated private businesses, they also desecrated the important message that was heard in the earlier peaceful protests.” Spartanburg, South Carolina: Passing motorists show support for protesters Chanting “No justice, no peace,” about 100 peaceful Spartanburg, South Carolina, protesters gathered at Barnet Park, drawing support from motorists who honked their car horns. “We want to take a peaceful stand to show support,” said organizer Kelvin Brown. “If we can all come together as a people, black and white, we can make a difference.” Many protesters said it wasn’t just Floyd’s death at the hand of a white police officer, or that it took days before the officer was arrested, that triggered anger. “We need to end the racist system,” said Curtis Pickens. “If you want all this to stop, real justice is what is needed. Stop the racial and social profiling. Stop hiring white supremacist officers.” “It’s time to stand up for what we believe in,” Isaiah Jordan said. “What happened to George Floyd terrorizes the whole nation. We’ve got to do something about it. I’m just sick and tired of young, black men dying."" --Bob Montgomery, GoUpstate.com Lafayette, Louisiana: Protesters want police to know 'we're human' Hundreds of protesters, some wearing protective face coverings, lined Lafayette streets to join a peaceful demonstration against police brutality. The protest, peaceful like others in Baton Rouge and New Orleans this weekend, began in the morning with protesters lining the streets to chant. “I am sick and tired of being sick and tired,” Lafayette NAACP President Marja Broussard said to protesters. “I have a message for law enforcement. The message is: we want you to know that we’re human just like you...We want you to know we have families. We’re human.” – William Taylor Potter, Lafayette Daily Advertiser Augusta, Georgia: Demonstrators chant 'No justice, no peace' Demonstrators chanted “no justice, no peace” as they walked along Washington Road in Augusta, Georgia. While “No justice, no peace,” was a popular chant among protesters, Sunday’s peaceful march was about showing strength through peace rather than through violence, organizers said. Latoya Lovett said she asked the Street Justice Council to help her organize the marches after hearing many Augusta residents talk about going to Atlanta to join protests there, which have turned violent after peaceful starts. “You can march in your own city, you can have a voice in your own city,” Lovett said. “You don’t have to go smash windows, you don’t have to go beat people, you don’t have to drop on the police.” Demonstrators were escorted by Richmond County Sheriff’s Office deputies who blocked off roads and intersections as needed. Sheriff Richard Roundtree was among those who helped guide the marchers and ensure safety for both them and the motorists. “We believe in free speech and protesting and voicing your opinion, as long as you do it in a safe manner,” Roundtree said. “As long as you’re doing that, we’re all for it.” – Will Cheney and Miguel Legoas, The Augusta Chronicle Jacksonville, Florida: Peaceful rally follows violent Saturday night of protests A peaceful demonstration was held Sunday outside the Duval County Courthouse. Then protesters started moving downtown and Jacksonville, Florida, police worked to keep them in certain areas. The cleanup of smashed store windows began Sunday around Florida after a night of unrest throughout the state’s cities. Jacksonville Sheriff Mike Williams said an unnamed deputy was either stabbed or slashed in the neck and was taken to a hospital for treatment Saturday night. A sheriff’s office spokeswoman would not comment on the deputy’s condition Sunday morning. A protest Saturday resulted in many arrests, “but we still don’t know how many or anything related to those arrests,” the sheriff said. – Sarasota News-Tribune Cincinnati: Police make 100 arrests after urging protesters to go home Police arrested as many as 100 people after using tear gas and imploring the crowd to go home ahead of a curfew. It ended a day that earlier featured a large crowd gathered at Inwood Park in Cincinnati to hear speakers as a rally, followed by a march. Organizers gave instructions about what to do if they are tear-gassed. The rally started with a fist-up salute and a song about the death Sam DuBose, shot by a police officer not far from the scene of this protest in 2015. Some Cincinnati City Council members tweeted from the rally. – Sarah Brookbank, Cincinnati Enquirer Contributing: The Associated Press",0.0
1622542158,2020-06-01 12:10:10,George Floyd. Ahmaud Arbery. Breonna Taylor. What do we tell our children?,https://www.scsuntimes.com/zz/news/20200601/george-floyd-ahmaud-arbery-breonna-taylor-what-do-we-tell-our-children?rssfeed=true,en,False,,371176,scsuntimes.com,http://scsuntimes.com/,"Should we tell the children? How? Those are among the many questions parents are asking after the recent deaths of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor. Many white parents wonder whether to talk with their kids at all, while parents of color swallow their grief and fear to have ""the talk"" once again. These deaths are part of a more complex story, one some parents have been telling for generations, and others have long felt they've had the luxury to ignore. But experts in child psychology and race-based stress say these conversations are essential for all parents to have, and they underscore that there are developmentally appropriate ways to talk to children of all ages about racism and police brutality. ""Silence will not protect you or them,"" said Beverly Daniel Tatum, a psychologist and author of, Why Are All The Black Kids Sitting Together in the Cafeteria? And Other Conversations About Race. ""Avoiding the topic is not a solution."" Racism persists, experts say, because many parents avoid difficult conversations. ""One of the most important things to remember is that you may not have all the answers and that is OK,"" said Erlanger Turner, a clinical psychologist and assistant professor of psychology at Pepperdine University who studies mental health among racial communities. USA TODAY spoke with Tatum and Turner about how to talk with children about racial violence: Why is it important to talk with children about what happened to George Floyd and other incidents of police brutality or racism in the news? Beverly Daniel Tatum: Even young children may see or hear about highly publicized incidents like the George Floyd case – perhaps overhearing the TV or the radio – and may ask questions. Or if parents are upset by the news, the child may perceive the parent’s distress and ask why mom or dad is upset. In either case, an age-appropriate explanation is better than silence. Older children with Internet access may see online images on their own. Initiating an age-appropriate conversation can give children a helpful frame for understanding difficult realities. If parents are silent, children will draw their own often faulty conclusions about what is happening and why. Erlanger Turner: Many adults are hurt and angered by these events and their children may notice changes in their mood. It is helpful to have a healthy conversation around what happened and also talk about ways to cope when you witness social injustice. Does COVID-19 warrant avoiding these conversations, given many children are already struggling with fear, anxiety and uncertainty? BDT: No. Not talking about upsetting events only fuels fear, anxiety and uncertainty. Being able to talk about something with a supportive adult can reduce fear, anxiety and uncertainty. Parents may avoid the conversation because they don’t know what to say, but it is a mistake to think that their silence is helpful. ET: I don't think that anxiety and fear about COVID-19 should stop a parent from talking about police brutality. This issue has been increasing in concern over the last few years as the number of black and brown people killed by police continue to rise. I think if you do talk with your child don't leave them in a high state of worry. Make sure to end the conversation by engaging in a pleasant activity after the difficult discussion so they won't stay worried or afraid. How do parents start these conversations and how does that change depending on the age of their children? ET: I think the first place to start a conversation around racism and police brutality is with honesty. Take ownership of your feelings and be comfortable sharing those feelings with your child. Then you can begin to allow them to share what they may already know about racial differences. I think that it is always good to allow children to share their opinion and understanding before you offer information. For younger children conversations about racism should be limited to basic facts about how people are treated differently due to the color of their skin but also acknowledge that not everyone treats people differently based on race. For older teens, parents can consider exposure to news or social media posts as discussion points about this issue. BDT: Regardless of the age of the child, it is important to balance acknowledging the reality of racism, or unfairness, with messages about the possibility of change, and the community of allies who are working together to make things better. If a child of color asks if a police officer is going to kill them, what do you say? BDT: The answer will depend on the age of the child. If it is a young child, a parent can be reassuring. “No, honey, you don’t have to worry about that. Police officers don’t want to hurt you.” In response to an older child, it can be reassuring to say something like: ""I know that it is scary to think that something like that might happen, and I really don’t want you to worry about anything like that. I know that most police officers want to help people, and most police officers never fire their guns. But sometimes they do get nervous and make mistakes. So it is important for you to know what to do if a police officer ever stops you…” Black parents often refer to this as “the talk” they have to have with their adolescent sons to increase the odds they will survive an encounter with a police officer if and when they are stopped. ET: That is a tough question. Depending on the age of the child, they may have some awareness of youth that have been killed by police. Obviously you don't want to respond in a way that is going to make children be more fearful for their safety. In my opinion, I think that you should let children know that most police officers work to protect them and their community. If a child says they are afraid or angry, what do you say? BDT: Acknowledge the child’s feelings. The parent may have similar feelings. “I know it’s upsetting to hear about and see these things happening. It upsets me too when bad things like this happen. Racism is very unfair. But it makes me feel better to know there are lots of people who want to change things."" Being able to offer specific examples of community change agents would be useful. Being able to talk about what family members are doing to speak up against unfairness is especially useful. Actions always speak louder than words. ET: If a child tells you that they are angry, that is appropriate. Don't force them to hide their emotional expression. However, be sure to help them identify ways to express their anger in a healthy manner which may include journaling or exercising to release the energy from their body. If a child is afraid for one of their friends, what do you say? BDT: “I can see that you are worried about your friend. What do you think we could do that might help him or her?” Depending on the situation, this could be an opportunity to talk about what it means to be an ally, and how to stand in solidarity with another person. ET: If a child is afraid for one of their friends, talk with them about those emotions. Allow the child to express why they may be afraid and help them identify how they can check on their friend's safety to ease their anxiety or fear. Part of what increases anxiety is the fear of the unknown. If you have a plan of action it will reduce some of those fears. How can parents talk about law enforcement in a way that is honest but also doesn’t discourage children from seeking help from law enforcement when appropriate? BDT: Most police officers become police officers because they want to help people. And there are times when we would really want a police officer to help us – give some examples – if there’s been a car accident, or if someone took something that belonged to us, etc. But sometimes a police officer does something bad, like today. When that happens, we might start to think that all police officers are like that. But it’s important to remember that that is not true. ET: I think that it is very important to talk with the children about law enforcement. For example, you can talk with them about how they protect rules in society such as making sure that people don't drive too fast so they won't harm themselves or others. Providing clear examples about the ways that law enforcement helps society will allow the child to better understand. You can also be honest about situations such as police brutality and let children know that some police officers break laws. If you have a trusted officer in your community it may be good to also allow the child to talk with them in person to reduce their fear. Should these conversations be different depending on the race of the child? BDT: Children of color are likely to experience racist encounters as they get older. They need to be helped to understand their own worth and feel affirmed in their identity as young people of color despite the negative messages they may get from others. Parents of color want to raise self-confident and empowered children who are not demoralized by other people’s racism. This requires lots of conversation about racism and how to resist it in an ongoing way throughout their children’s lives. White children are often racially isolated as a consequence of segregated schools and neighborhoods, and consequently limited in their understanding of people different from themselves. White parents who want to interrupt the cycle of racism must learn to talk to their children about it and model their own anti-racist activity. ET: According to research, white parents often don't talk with their children about race or may emphasize ""not seeing color."" The concept of colorblindness or ""not seeing color"" is more harmful than helpful and does not honor an individual's identity. ... For white families, research suggests ... conversations should focus on raising anti-racist children and encouraging more friendships with children from others races. Many of these deaths garner attention because footage of it goes viral. What should we say if our child asks to see it? BDT: There are many adults who don’t want to see such footage. I would not show it to a child at all. Once an image is in your head, it is very difficult to get it out. That said, it is reasonable to describe what happened and talk about why it was wrong. It is also likely that children with Internet access can view the footage without an adult’s permission or assistance. Talking about it after the fact will help children process their feelings. ET: You should not show your children these videos as it may increase the likelihood of them experiencing symptoms of trauma or having nightmares. What we know from research on witnessing disasters is that individuals may be at a higher risk of developing post-traumatic stress disorder even through indirect exposure to these events. What do we say if, in the course of this conversation, a child says something racist? BDT: Inquire about it with curiosity, not judgment. ""I’m wondering why you said that…"" After hearing more about what the child is thinking, you can offer correction by providing new information. “You know, a lot of people might think that is true, but I don’t because….” ET: I think the first thing to do is to not get defensive. You want to foster open communication with your child. However, I think you should explore why they have that opinion, where did they learn it from, and tell them why what they said was wrong. It might be helpful for you as a parent to think about ways that you may have unconsciously expressed racist attitudes. How can parents explain the uprisings in a way that doesn’t condone violence but also doesn't minimize the sense of injustice fueling them? BDT: Children understand the concept of unfairness as well as the experience of frustration. Years and years of unfairness – racism – results in intense anger and frustration. The conversation can then be about what we must do to fix the continuing unfairness. ET: I think it is important for parents to be honest. Share your hurt, anger, or disappointment with your child. You should also talk about different ways to protest social injustice such as calling your local politicians office or even visit their office to talk with them about policy change to reduce injustice.

The protests over George Floyd's death hit the nation's capital Friday night as angry protesters arrived at Pennsylvania Avenue, leading to a lockdown at the White House. Outside the White House on Friday, Secret Service could be seen after 7 p.m. taking at least one person into custody. Videos showed a large group of protesters gathering, with some burning flags and knocking over barricades. There were also some violent encounters. The president remained there about an hour before returning to the residence, according to a Republican close to the White House and an administration official who spoke to the Associated Press on the condition of anonymity. It is currently unknown whether first lady Melania Trump and their son, Barron, were with the president but the family has been shaken by the size and venom of the crowds, AP reported. ""The White House does not comment on security protocols and decisions,” said White House spokesman Judd Deere. The Secret Service said it does not discuss the means and methods of its protective operations. Officials told The New York Times, which first reported the story, they never believed Trump was in danger but took the precaution of moving him to the bunker as tensions escalated. Trump has told advisers he worries about his safety, while both privately and publicly praising the work of the Secret Service, according to the AP. Floyd, an unarmed black man, died in Minneapolis police custody this week after a white officer pinned him to the ground under his knee. His death has sparked demonstrations against police brutality and racial discrimination in cities across the United States. Trump praised the Secret Service and said he “watched every move” from inside the White House during Friday's protest and that he “couldn't have felt more safe.” ""They let the ‘protesters’ scream & rant as much as they wanted, but whenever someone got too frisky or out of line, they would quickly come down on them, hard – didn’t know what hit them,"" he said Saturday. Trump continued, ""The front line was replaced with fresh agents, like magic. Big crowd, professionally organized, but nobody came close to breaching the fence. If they had, they would have been greeted with the most vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons, I have ever seen. That’s when people would have been really badly hurt, at least."" He also claimed DC Mayor Muriel Bowser didn't allow DC police to ""get involved"" and assist Secret Service, though Secret Service later said they were on the scene.

Smoke continued to waft in the air 24 hours after people protesting the death of George Floyd lit fire to Moore's storefront, and several others along Lake Street. ""My business burned down two days ago, you see the flames? It's still going,"" Moore, 41, said Sunday. ""That flame down in people's soul? It's still going. They want justice."" She is among dozens of Minneapolis and St. Paul business owners, small and large, trying to rebuild after fiery riots and demonstrations in the Twin Cities on Thursday and Friday. Her company, ""Levels,"" which also has a St. Paul location that remains undamaged, was Moore's ""baby."" Moore, a black woman, said she started the business from the trunk of her car once she left a job with Minneapolis Public Schools in 2011 to pursue her passion for fashion and music. It had been opened for five years before people broke in Friday and started a fire that destroyed her business and several adjacent stores. When she was alerted to the break-in, Moore went to Lake Street and watched nearly a decade of work collapse into the concrete. ""I'm hurt that I lost this. But ... I can't cry right now,"" she said. ""I can't go home and cry and be hurt because I lost businesses. George Floyd lost his life. He'll never be here again."" She's confident she can recover but isn't sure if she can rebuild at the same location — in the heart of a diverse southside neighborhood. A GoFundMe has been started to help with those expenses. Other small businesses face similar uncertainty, but several fundraisers have been started to help support Minneapolis' littlest companies. As looters ransacked his St. Paul store, this business owner hid in the bathroom and whispered to 911 In St. Paul's Midway neighborhood, just blocks from where Moore's second Levels location was protected by armed men standing on its porch, one business owner said he hid in his office as people ransacked, urinated in and damaged the building. Jim Segal closed Ax-Man Surplus earlier than normal Thursday afternoon because daylight looting took hold at the nearby intersection of University and Snelling avenues. After sending customers and employees home and locking the front door, Segal said he continued to work in the office of the six-decade-old company. Then he heard multiple glass windows break. ""Luckily, I have a steel door because they were trying to enter the office,"" said Segal, who bought the surplus store about 20 years ago. ""I don't think they knew anybody was in there, but I basically barricaded myself within a bathroom inside the office."" He felt as if he were in a movie, the St. Paul native said. As display cases were shattered and electronics taken from inside his store, he whispered to 911 dispatch asking for help. ""Police said, 'Don't even bother boarding up your store,'"" Segal said Saturday. ""'There's a 50/50 chance it won't be here tomorrow."" About 6:30 p.m. Thursday, he returned to the St. Paul Ax-Man location, one of three in the metro, in an unsuccessful effort to shoo away people running in and out of his store. A company agreed to board up his windows, Segal said, but left quickly after arriving, not wanting to work amongst the crowd. He tried to get a license plate of someone stealing, but others tried to take his phone so he retreated to his car. Segal sat in his vehicle for hours as rioters peed in his store and took items ranging from knick-knacks and DVDs to a snow-blower. He said coronavirus concerns forced him to close his business for the better part of two months. They'd been reopened a little more than a week when the building was ransacked. ""I don't recall ever being in a situation where I was that panicked. I was petrified, actually,"" he said. Ax-Man won't reopen for at least a week or two, and Segal fears it may close permanently because of the lack of sales during the spring. That would mean a loss of livelihood for him and about 10 employees. He sympathizes with those upset about Floyd's death in police custody on Memorial Day, describing the video of Minneapolis police officers' actions ""horrific."" ""This is just stuff, no comparison (to a person dying),"" said Segal, a white man. ""But what I'm disappointed about is the lack of leadership in the government — Mayor (Melvin) Carter, Mayor (Jacob) Frey, Gov. (Tim) Walz — to just allow lawlessness. ""Indefensible what happened to Mr. Floyd, but this doesn't make it better. And I don't know what does."" Insurance helps small business owners, but a full recovery is 'a lot more complicated' While Moore and Segal both said they are insured, they don't believe insurance alone will enough to replace everything they've lost. People typically see business owner and think ""wealth,"" Segal said. ""That's not true for me,"" he said. ""I'm the last one to get paid."" Understanding insurance policies can be difficult for many small business owners, said Allison Sharkey, executive director of the Lake Street Council, which supports local companies. Lake Street has always been an area for Minneapolis's immigrant entrepreneurs to start businesses, she said, and many of those folks may not be familiar with aid systems or insurance proceedings. ""There's a lot of detail to go through in your contract that most people don't really understand until a situation like this happens,"" Sharkey said. ""It's a lot more complicated than just paying a $500 deductible and thinking the rest is going to be covered."" Minority business owners may not have the credit or assets to withstand closures as long as white business owners with more resources, she said. The council, and other metro business associations like it, try to fill that gap and provide guidance, but insurance claims won't stop some businesses from completely fading away. For Moore, she's frustrated when people bring up the fact she's insured because it ignores the work she put into the building and the items she won't get back. ""When you get it out the mud — meaning when you get it on your own, no handouts ... someone just handing you money doesn't equate,"" she said. ""It's deeper than that."" Financial support is coming for Twin Cities small businesses left in rubble amid George Floyd protests When Segal returned to his business Friday, he found a person who lived nearby sweeping glass from the sidewalk, which raised his spirits. Monetary support has begun, too. It's especially vital, small business advocates say, because many companies were already running out of money because of closures due to COVID-19. The Lake Street Council has received over $1.5 million to help support the hundreds of businesses that line the heavily damaged area. Sharkey said companies owned by people of color and immigrants have been especially affected by the days of unrest. Several ""big, beautiful"" buildings on the southside have been replaced by rubble, which will be eventually replaced by vacant lots. ""($1.5 million) sounds like a big number, but we're gonna need a lot more government and nonprofit support,"" Sharkey said. ""We have a long road ahead of us."" She said her organization had already begun to save money to distribute to companies dealing with financial contractions from the coronavirus, but it's not been shifted to riot recovery. The council will request an aid package from the state, but Sharkey thinks they'll need federal dollars as well. ""We're headed toward a recession,"" she said. ""We're really going to have to create a long-term strategy along with stakeholders, business owners, property owners business groups, elected officials."" Donations to that fund can be made here. Fundraising has begun in Segal's area, as well. The Hamline Midway Coalition has received more than $75,000 to help aid small businesses in their recovery from property damage and lost sales. Kate Mudge, the coalition's director, said the organization has been raising funds to help small and minority business owners worried about gentrification and corporatization coming with the new U.S. soccer stadium built nearby. ""We already have been dealing with a pandemic, we've been dealing with some long-term issues in our community, and this is the icing on the cake. We hope that this is gonna bring new people to Midway, new businesses,"" she said. ""We've dealt with worse."" Donations to the Midway fund can be made at here. Despite the uncertainty, the organizations are confident many businesses will survive if community support keeps up. ""I'm not blaming people, you can't judge anybody's pain or anger. Everyone acts and reacts to things in different ways,"" Moore said. ""I have a black-owned business, it was burned down and we were protesting, for a black man's life that was taken. So, I was just a little confused on where we're going with this. But, at the end of the day, everything is about sacrifices.""",0.0
1622542644,2020-06-01 11:20:00,"Their stores were burned, ransacked and looted. What's next for Minneapolis-area small business owners in danger of losing livelihoods?",https://www.milfordbeacon.com/zz/news/20200601/their-stores-were-burned-ransacked-and-looted-whats-next-for-minneapolis-area-small-business-owners-in-danger-of-losing-livelihoods?rssfeed=true,en,False,,659726,Milford Beacon,http://www.milfordbeacon.com/,"MINNEAPOLIS — Brandy Moore likened the charred remains of her south Minneapolis clothing store and recording studio to the pangs for equality that minorities here feel. Smoke continued to waft in the air 24 hours after people protesting the death of George Floyd lit fire to Moore's storefront, and several others along Lake Street. ""My business burned down two days ago, you see the flames? It's still going,"" Moore, 41, said Sunday. ""That flame down in people's soul? It's still going. They want justice."" She is among dozens of Minneapolis and St. Paul business owners, small and large, trying to rebuild after fiery riots and demonstrations in the Twin Cities on Thursday and Friday. Her company, ""Levels,"" which also has a St. Paul location that remains undamaged, was Moore's ""baby."" Moore, a black woman, said she started the business from the trunk of her car once she left a job with Minneapolis Public Schools in 2011 to pursue her passion for fashion and music. It had been opened for five years before people broke in Friday and started a fire that destroyed her business and several adjacent stores. When she was alerted to the break-in, Moore went to Lake Street and watched nearly a decade of work collapse into the concrete. ""I'm hurt that I lost this. But ... I can't cry right now,"" she said. ""I can't go home and cry and be hurt because I lost businesses. George Floyd lost his life. He'll never be here again."" She's confident she can recover but isn't sure if she can rebuild at the same location — in the heart of a diverse southside neighborhood. A GoFundMe has been started to help with those expenses. Other small businesses face similar uncertainty, but several fundraisers have been started to help support Minneapolis' littlest companies. As looters ransacked his St. Paul store, this business owner hid in the bathroom and whispered to 911 In St. Paul's Midway neighborhood, just blocks from where Moore's second Levels location was protected by armed men standing on its porch, one business owner said he hid in his office as people ransacked, urinated in and damaged the building. Jim Segal closed Ax-Man Surplus earlier than normal Thursday afternoon because daylight looting took hold at the nearby intersection of University and Snelling avenues. After sending customers and employees home and locking the front door, Segal said he continued to work in the office of the six-decade-old company. Then he heard multiple glass windows break. ""Luckily, I have a steel door because they were trying to enter the office,"" said Segal, who bought the surplus store about 20 years ago. ""I don't think they knew anybody was in there, but I basically barricaded myself within a bathroom inside the office."" He felt as if he were in a movie, the St. Paul native said. As display cases were shattered and electronics taken from inside his store, he whispered to 911 dispatch asking for help. ""Police said, 'Don't even bother boarding up your store,'"" Segal said Saturday. ""'There's a 50/50 chance it won't be here tomorrow."" About 6:30 p.m. Thursday, he returned to the St. Paul Ax-Man location, one of three in the metro, in an unsuccessful effort to shoo away people running in and out of his store. A company agreed to board up his windows, Segal said, but left quickly after arriving, not wanting to work amongst the crowd. He tried to get a license plate of someone stealing, but others tried to take his phone so he retreated to his car. Segal sat in his vehicle for hours as rioters peed in his store and took items ranging from knick-knacks and DVDs to a snow-blower. He said coronavirus concerns forced him to close his business for the better part of two months. They'd been reopened a little more than a week when the building was ransacked. ""I don't recall ever being in a situation where I was that panicked. I was petrified, actually,"" he said. Ax-Man won't reopen for at least a week or two, and Segal fears it may close permanently because of the lack of sales during the spring. That would mean a loss of livelihood for him and about 10 employees. He sympathizes with those upset about Floyd's death in police custody on Memorial Day, describing the video of Minneapolis police officers' actions ""horrific."" ""This is just stuff, no comparison (to a person dying),"" said Segal, a white man. ""But what I'm disappointed about is the lack of leadership in the government — Mayor (Melvin) Carter, Mayor (Jacob) Frey, Gov. (Tim) Walz — to just allow lawlessness. ""Indefensible what happened to Mr. Floyd, but this doesn't make it better. And I don't know what does."" Insurance helps small business owners, but a full recovery is 'a lot more complicated' While Moore and Segal both said they are insured, they don't believe insurance alone will enough to replace everything they've lost. People typically see business owner and think ""wealth,"" Segal said. ""That's not true for me,"" he said. ""I'm the last one to get paid."" Understanding insurance policies can be difficult for many small business owners, said Allison Sharkey, executive director of the Lake Street Council, which supports local companies. Lake Street has always been an area for Minneapolis's immigrant entrepreneurs to start businesses, she said, and many of those folks may not be familiar with aid systems or insurance proceedings. ""There's a lot of detail to go through in your contract that most people don't really understand until a situation like this happens,"" Sharkey said. ""It's a lot more complicated than just paying a $500 deductible and thinking the rest is going to be covered."" Minority business owners may not have the credit or assets to withstand closures as long as white business owners with more resources, she said. The council, and other metro business associations like it, try to fill that gap and provide guidance, but insurance claims won't stop some businesses from completely fading away. For Moore, she's frustrated when people bring up the fact she's insured because it ignores the work she put into the building and the items she won't get back. ""When you get it out the mud — meaning when you get it on your own, no handouts ... someone just handing you money doesn't equate,"" she said. ""It's deeper than that."" Financial support is coming for Twin Cities small businesses left in rubble amid George Floyd protests When Segal returned to his business Friday, he found a person who lived nearby sweeping glass from the sidewalk, which raised his spirits. Monetary support has begun, too. It's especially vital, small business advocates say, because many companies were already running out of money because of closures due to COVID-19. The Lake Street Council has received over $1.5 million to help support the hundreds of businesses that line the heavily damaged area. Sharkey said companies owned by people of color and immigrants have been especially affected by the days of unrest. Several ""big, beautiful"" buildings on the southside have been replaced by rubble, which will be eventually replaced by vacant lots. ""($1.5 million) sounds like a big number, but we're gonna need a lot more government and nonprofit support,"" Sharkey said. ""We have a long road ahead of us."" She said her organization had already begun to save money to distribute to companies dealing with financial contractions from the coronavirus, but it's not been shifted to riot recovery. The council will request an aid package from the state, but Sharkey thinks they'll need federal dollars as well. ""We're headed toward a recession,"" she said. ""We're really going to have to create a long-term strategy along with stakeholders, business owners, property owners business groups, elected officials."" Donations to that fund can be made here. Fundraising has begun in Segal's area, as well. The Hamline Midway Coalition has received more than $75,000 to help aid small businesses in their recovery from property damage and lost sales.

Jack Manderscheid, a University of Minnesota senior, exemplified the spirit of the day by meticulously walking through the Uptown neighborhood filling up four trash bags that he carried on his bicycle. “I’ve never really seen a community come together,” said Manderscheid, a native of suburban Edina who woke up Sunday intent on finding one gesture to help put the city. There have been five nights of anguished protests following the Monday death of George Floyd, a black man whose neck was knelt on for nearly nine minutes by Derek Chauvin, a white police officer. Manderscheid had attended a demonstration earlier in the week, but the fumes from tear gas used by police officers bothered him. So had the large crowds during a time when he is trying to keep his distance from people over fears of spreading the new coronavirus. He instead decided to clean the streets and sidewalks, only to find that hundreds of others had the same idea. “The longer this goes on, the more I realize I’m going to remember this the rest of my life,” Manderscheid said. Meanwhile, Dan Halvorsen picked up trash and swept away debris along with seven other members of his church in suburban Bloomington. “We wanted to perform a good deed. Our hearts are just breaking about this whole situation,” he said. “By the time we got here, the response has been so amazing, that there wasn’t a big need for us.” Other residents found a way to help by providing food, diapers and other essentials in a city where most stores and restaurants are closed. That’s how Tracy Gray Knutson found herself an unwitting, but perfectly willing, Santa Claus of sorts. Knutson, 40, sat down on a chair on the sidewalk outside a boarded-up Franklin Avenue café, planning to rest her sunburned feet. Above her, a large sign read: “Free Food and Stuff.” Residents of the south Minneapolis neighborhood surveyed the scene and decided that Knutson was in charge of a popup pantry. Soon, they descended on her with sacks of bread, beans and other groceries, plus diapers, bottled water and even more garbage bags ready to be filled. Knutson, who said she is recently homeless, enjoyed giving the goods away to a line of people who politely approached her, asking if it was really free. “Anything you want, brother. Take anything,” she implored one hesitant man. “I love you.” A few blocks away on Franklin Avenue, an east-west thoroughfare lined with stores that now sit empty, Alan Gross oversaw an impromptu food shelf that quickly resembled a warehouse. Gross, 52, jokingly called himself a barista/counselor/bouncer at two businesses that share a building: Powwow Grounds Coffee and All My Relations Gallery. The latter is a large space that typically displays American Indian art. It was shuttered in March after the COVID-19 threat forced the closure of museums and galleries in Minnesota. The art has been relocated, although Gross hopes to reopen soon. On Sunday, the floor was rapidly filling with food brought in by the carload from people eager to help. It all happened over the course of 72 hours, after word went out on Facebook that the gallery would serve as a distribution point for groceries in the neighborhood. Gross was surprised by the amount of donated food but philosophical about the motivation of his fellow Minnesotans. “Pitching in, believing that there’s a better way to do things, I think that’s the draw,” he said. “Everyone’s got to have a cause.”",0.0

1622542628,2020-06-01 12:10:10,George Floyd. Ahmaud Arbery. Breonna Taylor. What do we tell our children?,https://www.milfordbeacon.com/zz/news/20200601/george-floyd-ahmaud-arbery-breonna-taylor-what-do-we-tell-our-children?rssfeed=true,en,False,,659726,Milford Beacon,http://www.milfordbeacon.com/,"Should we tell the children? How? Those are among the many questions parents are asking after the recent deaths of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor. Many white parents wonder whether to talk with their kids at all, while parents of color swallow their grief and fear to have ""the talk"" once again. These deaths are part of a more complex story, one some parents have been telling for generations, and others have long felt they've had the luxury to ignore. But experts in child psychology and race-based stress say these conversations are essential for all parents to have, and they underscore that there are developmentally appropriate ways to talk to children of all ages about racism and police brutality. ""Silence will not protect you or them,"" said Beverly Daniel Tatum, a psychologist and author of, Why Are All The Black Kids Sitting Together in the Cafeteria? And Other Conversations About Race. ""Avoiding the topic is not a solution."" Racism persists, experts say, because many parents avoid difficult conversations. ""One of the most important things to remember is that you may not have all the answers and that is OK,"" said Erlanger Turner, a clinical psychologist and assistant professor of psychology at Pepperdine University who studies mental health among racial communities. USA TODAY spoke with Tatum and Turner about how to talk with children about racial violence: Why is it important to talk with children about what happened to George Floyd and other incidents of police brutality or racism in the news? Beverly Daniel Tatum: Even young children may see or hear about highly publicized incidents like the George Floyd case – perhaps overhearing the TV or the radio – and may ask questions. Or if parents are upset by the news, the child may perceive the parent’s distress and ask why mom or dad is upset. In either case, an age-appropriate explanation is better than silence. Older children with Internet access may see online images on their own. Initiating an age-appropriate conversation can give children a helpful frame for understanding difficult realities. If parents are silent, children will draw their own often faulty conclusions about what is happening and why. Erlanger Turner: Many adults are hurt and angered by these events and their children may notice changes in their mood. It is helpful to have a healthy conversation around what happened and also talk about ways to cope when you witness social injustice. Does COVID-19 warrant avoiding these conversations, given many children are already struggling with fear, anxiety and uncertainty? BDT: No. Not talking about upsetting events only fuels fear, anxiety and uncertainty. Being able to talk about something with a supportive adult can reduce fear, anxiety and uncertainty. Parents may avoid the conversation because they don’t know what to say, but it is a mistake to think that their silence is helpful. ET: I don't think that anxiety and fear about COVID-19 should stop a parent from talking about police brutality. This issue has been increasing in concern over the last few years as the number of black and brown people killed by police continue to rise. I think if you do talk with your child don't leave them in a high state of worry. Make sure to end the conversation by engaging in a pleasant activity after the difficult discussion so they won't stay worried or afraid. How do parents start these conversations and how does that change depending on the age of their children? ET: I think the first place to start a conversation around racism and police brutality is with honesty. Take ownership of your feelings and be comfortable sharing those feelings with your child. Then you can begin to allow them to share what they may already know about racial differences. I think that it is always good to allow children to share their opinion and understanding before you offer information. For younger children conversations about racism should be limited to basic facts about how people are treated differently due to the color of their skin but also acknowledge that not everyone treats people differently based on race. For older teens, parents can consider exposure to news or social media posts as discussion points about this issue. BDT: Regardless of the age of the child, it is important to balance acknowledging the reality of racism, or unfairness, with messages about the possibility of change, and the community of allies who are working together to make things better. If a child of color asks if a police officer is going to kill them, what do you say? BDT: The answer will depend on the age of the child. If it is a young child, a parent can be reassuring. “No, honey, you don’t have to worry about that. Police officers don’t want to hurt you.” In response to an older child, it can be reassuring to say something like: ""I know that it is scary to think that something like that might happen, and I really don’t want you to worry about anything like that. I know that most police officers want to help people, and most police officers never fire their guns. But sometimes they do get nervous and make mistakes. So it is important for you to know what to do if a police officer ever stops you…” Black parents often refer to this as “the talk” they have to have with their adolescent sons to increase the odds they will survive an encounter with a police officer if and when they are stopped. ET: That is a tough question. Depending on the age of the child, they may have some awareness of youth that have been killed by police. Obviously you don't want to respond in a way that is going to make children be more fearful for their safety. In my opinion, I think that you should let children know that most police officers work to protect them and their community. If a child says they are afraid or angry, what do you say? BDT: Acknowledge the child’s feelings. The parent may have similar feelings. “I know it’s upsetting to hear about and see these things happening. It upsets me too when bad things like this happen. Racism is very unfair. But it makes me feel better to know there are lots of people who want to change things."" Being able to offer specific examples of community change agents would be useful. Being able to talk about what family members are doing to speak up against unfairness is especially useful. Actions always speak louder than words. ET: If a child tells you that they are angry, that is appropriate. Don't force them to hide their emotional expression. However, be sure to help them identify ways to express their anger in a healthy manner which may include journaling or exercising to release the energy from their body. If a child is afraid for one of their friends, what do you say? BDT: “I can see that you are worried about your friend. What do you think we could do that might help him or her?” Depending on the situation, this could be an opportunity to talk about what it means to be an ally, and how to stand in solidarity with another person. ET: If a child is afraid for one of their friends, talk with them about those emotions. Allow the child to express why they may be afraid and help them identify how they can check on their friend's safety to ease their anxiety or fear. Part of what increases anxiety is the fear of the unknown. If you have a plan of action it will reduce some of those fears. How can parents talk about law enforcement in a way that is honest but also doesn’t discourage children from seeking help from law enforcement when appropriate? BDT: Most police officers become police officers because they want to help people. And there are times when we would really want a police officer to help us – give some examples – if there’s been a car accident, or if someone took something that belonged to us, etc. But sometimes a police officer does something bad, like today. When that happens, we might start to think that all police officers are like that. But it’s important to remember that that is not true. ET: I think that it is very important to talk with the children about law enforcement. For example, you can talk with them about how they protect rules in society such as making sure that people don't drive too fast so they won't harm themselves or others. Providing clear examples about the ways that law enforcement helps society will allow the child to better understand. You can also be honest about situations such as police brutality and let children know that some police officers break laws. If you have a trusted officer in your community it may be good to also allow the child to talk with them in person to reduce their fear. Should these conversations be different depending on the race of the child? BDT: Children of color are likely to experience racist encounters as they get older. They need to be helped to understand their own worth and feel affirmed in their identity as young people of color despite the negative messages they may get from others. Parents of color want to raise self-confident and empowered children who are not demoralized by other people’s racism. This requires lots of conversation about racism and how to resist it in an ongoing way throughout their children’s lives. White children are often racially isolated as a consequence of segregated schools and neighborhoods, and consequently limited in their understanding of people different from themselves. White parents who want to interrupt the cycle of racism must learn to talk to their children about it and model their own anti-racist activity. ET: According to research, white parents often don't talk with their children about race or may emphasize ""not seeing color."" The concept of colorblindness or ""not seeing color"" is more harmful than helpful and does not honor an individual's identity. ... For white families, research suggests ... conversations should focus on raising anti-racist children and encouraging more friendships with children from others races. Many of these deaths garner attention because footage of it goes viral. What should we say if our child asks to see it? BDT: There are many adults who don’t want to see such footage. I would not show it to a child at all. Once an image is in your head, it is very difficult to get it out. That said, it is reasonable to describe what happened and talk about why it was wrong. It is also likely that children with Internet access can view the footage without an adult’s permission or assistance. Talking about it after the fact will help children process their feelings. ET: You should not show your children these videos as it may increase the likelihood of them experiencing symptoms of trauma or having nightmares. What we know from research on witnessing disasters is that individuals may be at a higher risk of developing post-traumatic stress disorder even through indirect exposure to these events. What do we say if, in the course of this conversation, a child says something racist? BDT: Inquire about it with curiosity, not judgment. ""I’m wondering why you said that…"" After hearing more about what the child is thinking, you can offer correction by providing new information. “You know, a lot of people might think that is true, but I don’t because….” ET: I think the first thing to do is to not get defensive. You want to foster open communication with your child. However, I think you should explore why they have that opinion, where did they learn it from, and tell them why what they said was wrong. It might be helpful for you as a parent to think about ways that you may have unconsciously expressed racist attitudes. How can parents explain the uprisings in a way that doesn’t condone violence but also doesn't minimize the sense of injustice fueling them? BDT: Children understand the concept of unfairness as well as the experience of frustration. Years and years of unfairness – racism – results in intense anger and frustration. The conversation can then be about what we must do to fix the continuing unfairness. ET: I think it is important for parents to be honest. Share your hurt, anger, or disappointment with your child. You should also talk about different ways to protest social injustice such as calling your local politicians office or even visit their office to talk with them about policy change to reduce injustice.

Most demonstrations, some attracting hundreds of people, were peaceful though violence, including the burning of police vehicles and looting, prompted police in some cities to deploy tear gas to gain control of the crowd. Early in the day, volunteers turned out in many cities to sweep up debris from businesses that had been burned, had their windows broken or were otherwise damaged Saturday. Here's a look at how protests are unfolding around the country on Sunday: Washington, D.C.: Historic St. John's Church near White House set ablaze As protesters gathered near the White House, flames were seen at the Washington, D.C., landmark that bills itself as ""the church of the presidents."" The fire, apparently an act of arson, was in the basement of St. John's Church, across from the White House, The Washington Post reported, and was extinguished. It occurred as a demonstration was taking place outside. The gathering had attracted as many as 1,000 Sunday, who faced off against officers in riot gear. The Episcopalian church in Lafayette Square boasts on its website that every U.S. president since James Madison has attended services there. Consecrated in 1816, the church also says the bell in its steeple, weighing almost 1,000 pounds, was cast in 1822 by Paul Revere's son Joseph. New York City: Protesters force closure of Manhattan Bridge; street fires, looting A crucial bridge into Manhattan was closed Sunday to make way for protesters, a day after hundreds of arrests including the mayor's daughter, it was reported. Street fires were being set and sporadic looting was reported Sunday evening after a day that saw large groups of protesters walk from Brooklyn to Manhattan over the Manhattan Bridge, which had to be closed, ABC7 in New York reported. Mayor Bill de Blasio's daughter Chiara, 25, was among 345 arrested, the station reported based on unnamed NYPD sources. The Daily Mail said it was able to confirm the arrest from a police report. She was reportedly arrested as part of a group of 100 demonstrators who refused to leave a roadway when ordered by police. Seattle: National Guard called to Bellevue; protesters block Interstate 5 National Guard troops were ordered to the Seattle suburb of Bellevue after reports of widespread looting. Washington Gov. Jay Inslee ordered 200 National Guard members to Bellevue after the mayor declared an emergency due to violence. Rioters broke into the Bellevue Mall and were stealing goods from stores. The thefts were part of a day of protests in the Seattle area that included shutting down Interstate 5, the same freeway that San Diego demonstrators blocked more than 1,000 miles away in southern California. Chicago: Gov. JB Pritzker activates National Guardsmen to assist police Vandalism reports continued to crop up in several city neighborhoods and some suburbs. The communities of Tinley Park, Crestwood and Oak Lawn alerted residents to stay home due to civil unrest. Many businesses boarded up. Gov. J.B. Pritzker said he activated 375 Illinois National Guard soldiers to assist local law enforcement with street closures. The downtown Chicago demonstrations that drew thousands started peacefully Saturday afternoon in a plaza, with protesters reading the names of black people who have died at the hands of police. But that gave way to violence and destruction that continued overnight Sunday in Chicago and elsewhere. Police used batons to beat back demonstrators as police cars were set ablaze and windows were smashed at businesses ranging from neighborhood convenience stores to high-end Michigan Avenue shops. Santa Monica, California: Unchecked looting as marchers confront police Looters took advantage of a large demonstration several blocks away to hit stores in the city's business district. In late afternoon, police were met with resistance when they tried to end a demonstration that had been peaceful. Demonstrators constructed a makeshift barricade in the middle of a street to protect themselves from non-lethal rounds fired by officers. The march had attracted hundreds along the city's main oceanfront boulevard. Though there were many police officers present for the march, looters were able to plunder stores with few to stop them. Cars were seen pulling up in front of stores, with looters running in to collect bundles of clothes and other merchandise, then running out. Boxes littered the sidewalk as thieves were seen transferring goods into plastic trash bags. A 5:30 p.m. PST curfew was announced due to the protests. The looting came despite the arrival of the National Guard troops in neighboring Los Angeles, which had seen extensive looting, vandalism and arson on Saturday. Murfreesboro, Tennessee: Brick thrown into business, police use tear gas A small but tense demonstration in Murfreesboro, Tennessee, appeared to have dispersed after demonstrators blocked traffic and threw a brick through the window of a local business, prompting police to respond with canisters of tear gas. About 50 protesters, many of whom appeared to be Middle Tennessee State University students, marched from Main Street toward Forrest Hall, a campus building named for Confederate general and Ku Klux Klan founder Nathan Bedford Forrest. Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee said protests in Murfreesboro are now “overt threats to public safety and property.” Police said an armored vehicle was vandalized and protesters have blocked traffic by lying in the street in an intersection. Officers responded by throwing canisters of tear gas to drive protesters out of the street. However, before the protest escalated, negotiations between police and protest leaders led to calm, then students and officers were seen walking together and posing for photos. – Nancy DeGennaro, Joseph Spears, Mealand Ragland-Hudgins and Brinley Hineman, Murfreesboro Daily News Journal Savannah, Georgia: Protesters chant 'Arrest the other three' during rally Thousands demonstrated against racism and the killings of black people at the hands of police Sunday in Savannah, Georgia. City leaders joined protesters who peacefully marched from Johnson Square to City Hall. “We need to make sure that we stop apologizing and we move from apology to action,” Savannah Police Chief Roy Minter said. At one point during Mayor Van Johnson’s speech, the crowd broke into a chant of “arrest the other three,” referring to other Minneapolis police officers who stood by while an officer knelt on Floyd’s neck. “Yeah, they should arrest the other three,” Johnson said. “We are tired of the mess and we want it to stop now. We stand here as a united community to say that we are standing with George Floyd and his family, because no man should ever have to die like that,” Johnson said. “We stand here united as a community to say that crooked police officers are called criminals. And in jail, they should be.” – Will Peebles, Dennis Knight, Mary Landers, Nathan Dominitz and Zach Dennis, Savannah Morning News San Diego: Police fire tear gas after being assaulted by rocks and bottles San Diego Police said they fired tear gas canisters Sunday after rocks and bottles were thrown at them. The department said in a series of tweets that the confrontation was taking place at Second Avenue and Broadway in the seaside city's downtown. ""Certain protestors continue to throw objects and vandalize our city,"" the department said in one post. ""The criminal behavior of these few is unacceptable. We are continuing to order the crowd to disperse."" Earlier, however, the department praised the peacefulness of most demonstrators. But it said it had to issue the order to disperse because of the dangerous actions of a few. At one point, demonstrators occupied Interstate 5, stopping traffic in both directions, the San Diego Union-Tribune reported. Philadelphia: Mayor Jim Kenney 'saddened and disappointed' beyond words Another day of street protests gave way to looting, with at least one police vehicle set on fire. Looters were running out of stores in the northeastern section of the city with armloads of merchandise. In the downtown, workers and volunteers swept up broken glass from windows shattered during riots the previous day. Graffiti was being removed. Mayor Jim Kenney said the mayhem “saddened and disappointed me beyond words, and I’m sure it saddened every Philadelphian who takes pride in their city.” He said those responsible “not only desecrated private businesses, they also desecrated the important message that was heard in the earlier peaceful protests.” Spartanburg, South Carolina: Passing motorists show support for protesters Chanting “No justice, no peace,” about 100 peaceful Spartanburg, South Carolina, protesters gathered at Barnet Park, drawing support from motorists who honked their car horns. “We want to take a peaceful stand to show support,” said organizer Kelvin Brown. “If we can all come together as a people, black and white, we can make a difference.” Many protesters said it wasn’t just Floyd’s death at the hand of a white police officer, or that it took days before the officer was arrested, that triggered anger. “We need to end the racist system,” said Curtis Pickens. “If you want all this to stop, real justice is what is needed. Stop the racial and social profiling. Stop hiring white supremacist officers.” “It’s time to stand up for what we believe in,” Isaiah Jordan said. “What happened to George Floyd terrorizes the whole nation. We’ve got to do something about it. I’m just sick and tired of young, black men dying."" --Bob Montgomery, GoUpstate.com Lafayette, Louisiana: Protesters want police to know 'we're human' Hundreds of protesters, some wearing protective face coverings, lined Lafayette streets to join a peaceful demonstration against police brutality. The protest, peaceful like others in Baton Rouge and New Orleans this weekend, began in the morning with protesters lining the streets to chant. “I am sick and tired of being sick and tired,” Lafayette NAACP President Marja Broussard said to protesters. “I have a message for law enforcement. The message is: we want you to know that we’re human just like you...We want you to know we have families. We’re human.” – William Taylor Potter, Lafayette Daily Advertiser Augusta, Georgia: Demonstrators chant 'No justice, no peace' Demonstrators chanted “no justice, no peace” as they walked along Washington Road in Augusta, Georgia. While “No justice, no peace,” was a popular chant among protesters, Sunday’s peaceful march was about showing strength through peace rather than through violence, organizers said. Latoya Lovett said she asked the Street Justice Council to help her organize the marches after hearing many Augusta residents talk about going to Atlanta to join protests there, which have turned violent after peaceful starts. “You can march in your own city, you can have a voice in your own city,” Lovett said. “You don’t have to go smash windows, you don’t have to go beat people, you don’t have to drop on the police.” Demonstrators were escorted by Richmond County Sheriff’s Office deputies who blocked off roads and intersections as needed. Sheriff Richard Roundtree was among those who helped guide the marchers and ensure safety for both them and the motorists. “We believe in free speech and protesting and voicing your opinion, as long as you do it in a safe manner,” Roundtree said. “As long as you’re doing that, we’re all for it.” – Will Cheney and Miguel Legoas, The Augusta Chronicle Jacksonville, Florida: Peaceful rally follows violent Saturday night of protests A peaceful demonstration was held Sunday outside the Duval County Courthouse. Then protesters started moving downtown and Jacksonville, Florida, police worked to keep them in certain areas. The cleanup of smashed store windows began Sunday around Florida after a night of unrest throughout the state’s cities. Jacksonville Sheriff Mike Williams said an unnamed deputy was either stabbed or slashed in the neck and was taken to a hospital for treatment Saturday night. A sheriff’s office spokeswoman would not comment on the deputy’s condition Sunday morning. A protest Saturday resulted in many arrests, “but we still don’t know how many or anything related to those arrests,” the sheriff said. – Sarasota News-Tribune Cincinnati: Police make 100 arrests after urging protesters to go home Police arrested as many as 100 people after using tear gas and imploring the crowd to go home ahead of a curfew. It ended a day that earlier featured a large crowd gathered at Inwood Park in Cincinnati to hear speakers as a rally, followed by a march. Organizers gave instructions about what to do if they are tear-gassed. The rally started with a fist-up salute and a song about the death Sam DuBose, shot by a police officer not far from the scene of this protest in 2015. Some Cincinnati City Council members tweeted from the rally. – Sarah Brookbank, Cincinnati Enquirer Contributing: The Associated Press",0.0

Jack Manderscheid, a University of Minnesota senior, exemplified the spirit of the day by meticulously walking through the Uptown neighborhood filling up four trash bags that he carried on his bicycle. “I’ve never really seen a community come together,” said Manderscheid, a native of suburban Edina who woke up Sunday intent on finding one gesture to help put the city. There have been five nights of anguished protests following the Monday death of George Floyd, a black man whose neck was knelt on for nearly nine minutes by Derek Chauvin, a white police officer. Manderscheid had attended a demonstration earlier in the week, but the fumes from tear gas used by police officers bothered him. So had the large crowds during a time when he is trying to keep his distance from people over fears of spreading the new coronavirus. He instead decided to clean the streets and sidewalks, only to find that hundreds of others had the same idea. “The longer this goes on, the more I realize I’m going to remember this the rest of my life,” Manderscheid said. Meanwhile, Dan Halvorsen picked up trash and swept away debris along with seven other members of his church in suburban Bloomington. “We wanted to perform a good deed. Our hearts are just breaking about this whole situation,” he said. “By the time we got here, the response has been so amazing, that there wasn’t a big need for us.” Other residents found a way to help by providing food, diapers and other essentials in a city where most stores and restaurants are closed. That’s how Tracy Gray Knutson found herself an unwitting, but perfectly willing, Santa Claus of sorts. Knutson, 40, sat down on a chair on the sidewalk outside a boarded-up Franklin Avenue café, planning to rest her sunburned feet. Above her, a large sign read: “Free Food and Stuff.” Residents of the south Minneapolis neighborhood surveyed the scene and decided that Knutson was in charge of a popup pantry. Soon, they descended on her with sacks of bread, beans and other groceries, plus diapers, bottled water and even more garbage bags ready to be filled. Knutson, who said she is recently homeless, enjoyed giving the goods away to a line of people who politely approached her, asking if it was really free. “Anything you want, brother. Take anything,” she implored one hesitant man. “I love you.” A few blocks away on Franklin Avenue, an east-west thoroughfare lined with stores that now sit empty, Alan Gross oversaw an impromptu food shelf that quickly resembled a warehouse. Gross, 52, jokingly called himself a barista/counselor/bouncer at two businesses that share a building: Powwow Grounds Coffee and All My Relations Gallery. The latter is a large space that typically displays American Indian art. It was shuttered in March after the COVID-19 threat forced the closure of museums and galleries in Minnesota. The art has been relocated, although Gross hopes to reopen soon. On Sunday, the floor was rapidly filling with food brought in by the carload from people eager to help. It all happened over the course of 72 hours, after word went out on Facebook that the gallery would serve as a distribution point for groceries in the neighborhood. Gross was surprised by the amount of donated food but philosophical about the motivation of his fellow Minnesotans. “Pitching in, believing that there’s a better way to do things, I think that’s the draw,” he said. “Everyone’s got to have a cause.”",0.0

1622542614,2020-06-01 12:10:10,George Floyd. Ahmaud Arbery. Breonna Taylor. What do we tell our children?,https://www.sussexcountian.com/zz/news/20200601/george-floyd-ahmaud-arbery-breonna-taylor-what-do-we-tell-our-children?rssfeed=true,en,False,,349515,sussexcountian.com,http://sussexcountian.com/,"Should we tell the children? How? Those are among the many questions parents are asking after the recent deaths of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor. Many white parents wonder whether to talk with their kids at all, while parents of color swallow their grief and fear to have ""the talk"" once again. These deaths are part of a more complex story, one some parents have been telling for generations, and others have long felt they've had the luxury to ignore. But experts in child psychology and race-based stress say these conversations are essential for all parents to have, and they underscore that there are developmentally appropriate ways to talk to children of all ages about racism and police brutality. ""Silence will not protect you or them,"" said Beverly Daniel Tatum, a psychologist and author of, Why Are All The Black Kids Sitting Together in the Cafeteria? And Other Conversations About Race. ""Avoiding the topic is not a solution."" Racism persists, experts say, because many parents avoid difficult conversations. ""One of the most important things to remember is that you may not have all the answers and that is OK,"" said Erlanger Turner, a clinical psychologist and assistant professor of psychology at Pepperdine University who studies mental health among racial communities. USA TODAY spoke with Tatum and Turner about how to talk with children about racial violence: Why is it important to talk with children about what happened to George Floyd and other incidents of police brutality or racism in the news? Beverly Daniel Tatum: Even young children may see or hear about highly publicized incidents like the George Floyd case – perhaps overhearing the TV or the radio – and may ask questions. Or if parents are upset by the news, the child may perceive the parent’s distress and ask why mom or dad is upset. In either case, an age-appropriate explanation is better than silence. Older children with Internet access may see online images on their own. Initiating an age-appropriate conversation can give children a helpful frame for understanding difficult realities. If parents are silent, children will draw their own often faulty conclusions about what is happening and why. Erlanger Turner: Many adults are hurt and angered by these events and their children may notice changes in their mood. It is helpful to have a healthy conversation around what happened and also talk about ways to cope when you witness social injustice. Does COVID-19 warrant avoiding these conversations, given many children are already struggling with fear, anxiety and uncertainty? BDT: No. Not talking about upsetting events only fuels fear, anxiety and uncertainty. Being able to talk about something with a supportive adult can reduce fear, anxiety and uncertainty. Parents may avoid the conversation because they don’t know what to say, but it is a mistake to think that their silence is helpful. ET: I don't think that anxiety and fear about COVID-19 should stop a parent from talking about police brutality. This issue has been increasing in concern over the last few years as the number of black and brown people killed by police continue to rise. I think if you do talk with your child don't leave them in a high state of worry. Make sure to end the conversation by engaging in a pleasant activity after the difficult discussion so they won't stay worried or afraid. How do parents start these conversations and how does that change depending on the age of their children? ET: I think the first place to start a conversation around racism and police brutality is with honesty. Take ownership of your feelings and be comfortable sharing those feelings with your child. Then you can begin to allow them to share what they may already know about racial differences. I think that it is always good to allow children to share their opinion and understanding before you offer information. For younger children conversations about racism should be limited to basic facts about how people are treated differently due to the color of their skin but also acknowledge that not everyone treats people differently based on race. For older teens, parents can consider exposure to news or social media posts as discussion points about this issue. BDT: Regardless of the age of the child, it is important to balance acknowledging the reality of racism, or unfairness, with messages about the possibility of change, and the community of allies who are working together to make things better. If a child of color asks if a police officer is going to kill them, what do you say? BDT: The answer will depend on the age of the child. If it is a young child, a parent can be reassuring. “No, honey, you don’t have to worry about that. Police officers don’t want to hurt you.” In response to an older child, it can be reassuring to say something like: ""I know that it is scary to think that something like that might happen, and I really don’t want you to worry about anything like that. I know that most police officers want to help people, and most police officers never fire their guns. But sometimes they do get nervous and make mistakes. So it is important for you to know what to do if a police officer ever stops you…” Black parents often refer to this as “the talk” they have to have with their adolescent sons to increase the odds they will survive an encounter with a police officer if and when they are stopped. ET: That is a tough question. Depending on the age of the child, they may have some awareness of youth that have been killed by police. Obviously you don't want to respond in a way that is going to make children be more fearful for their safety. In my opinion, I think that you should let children know that most police officers work to protect them and their community. If a child says they are afraid or angry, what do you say? BDT: Acknowledge the child’s feelings. The parent may have similar feelings. “I know it’s upsetting to hear about and see these things happening. It upsets me too when bad things like this happen. Racism is very unfair. But it makes me feel better to know there are lots of people who want to change things."" Being able to offer specific examples of community change agents would be useful. Being able to talk about what family members are doing to speak up against unfairness is especially useful. Actions always speak louder than words. ET: If a child tells you that they are angry, that is appropriate. Don't force them to hide their emotional expression. However, be sure to help them identify ways to express their anger in a healthy manner which may include journaling or exercising to release the energy from their body. If a child is afraid for one of their friends, what do you say? BDT: “I can see that you are worried about your friend. What do you think we could do that might help him or her?” Depending on the situation, this could be an opportunity to talk about what it means to be an ally, and how to stand in solidarity with another person. ET: If a child is afraid for one of their friends, talk with them about those emotions. Allow the child to express why they may be afraid and help them identify how they can check on their friend's safety to ease their anxiety or fear. Part of what increases anxiety is the fear of the unknown. If you have a plan of action it will reduce some of those fears. How can parents talk about law enforcement in a way that is honest but also doesn’t discourage children from seeking help from law enforcement when appropriate? BDT: Most police officers become police officers because they want to help people. And there are times when we would really want a police officer to help us – give some examples – if there’s been a car accident, or if someone took something that belonged to us, etc. But sometimes a police officer does something bad, like today. When that happens, we might start to think that all police officers are like that. But it’s important to remember that that is not true. ET: I think that it is very important to talk with the children about law enforcement. For example, you can talk with them about how they protect rules in society such as making sure that people don't drive too fast so they won't harm themselves or others. Providing clear examples about the ways that law enforcement helps society will allow the child to better understand. You can also be honest about situations such as police brutality and let children know that some police officers break laws. If you have a trusted officer in your community it may be good to also allow the child to talk with them in person to reduce their fear. Should these conversations be different depending on the race of the child? BDT: Children of color are likely to experience racist encounters as they get older. They need to be helped to understand their own worth and feel affirmed in their identity as young people of color despite the negative messages they may get from others. Parents of color want to raise self-confident and empowered children who are not demoralized by other people’s racism. This requires lots of conversation about racism and how to resist it in an ongoing way throughout their children’s lives. White children are often racially isolated as a consequence of segregated schools and neighborhoods, and consequently limited in their understanding of people different from themselves. White parents who want to interrupt the cycle of racism must learn to talk to their children about it and model their own anti-racist activity. ET: According to research, white parents often don't talk with their children about race or may emphasize ""not seeing color."" The concept of colorblindness or ""not seeing color"" is more harmful than helpful and does not honor an individual's identity. ... For white families, research suggests ... conversations should focus on raising anti-racist children and encouraging more friendships with children from others races. Many of these deaths garner attention because footage of it goes viral. What should we say if our child asks to see it? BDT: There are many adults who don’t want to see such footage. I would not show it to a child at all. Once an image is in your head, it is very difficult to get it out. That said, it is reasonable to describe what happened and talk about why it was wrong. It is also likely that children with Internet access can view the footage without an adult’s permission or assistance. Talking about it after the fact will help children process their feelings. ET: You should not show your children these videos as it may increase the likelihood of them experiencing symptoms of trauma or having nightmares. What we know from research on witnessing disasters is that individuals may be at a higher risk of developing post-traumatic stress disorder even through indirect exposure to these events. What do we say if, in the course of this conversation, a child says something racist? BDT: Inquire about it with curiosity, not judgment. ""I’m wondering why you said that…"" After hearing more about what the child is thinking, you can offer correction by providing new information. “You know, a lot of people might think that is true, but I don’t because….” ET: I think the first thing to do is to not get defensive. You want to foster open communication with your child. However, I think you should explore why they have that opinion, where did they learn it from, and tell them why what they said was wrong. It might be helpful for you as a parent to think about ways that you may have unconsciously expressed racist attitudes. How can parents explain the uprisings in a way that doesn’t condone violence but also doesn't minimize the sense of injustice fueling them? BDT: Children understand the concept of unfairness as well as the experience of frustration. Years and years of unfairness – racism – results in intense anger and frustration. The conversation can then be about what we must do to fix the continuing unfairness. ET: I think it is important for parents to be honest. Share your hurt, anger, or disappointment with your child. You should also talk about different ways to protest social injustice such as calling your local politicians office or even visit their office to talk with them about policy change to reduce injustice.

Most demonstrations, some attracting hundreds of people, were peaceful though violence, including the burning of police vehicles and looting, prompted police in some cities to deploy tear gas to gain control of the crowd. Early in the day, volunteers turned out in many cities to sweep up debris from businesses that had been burned, had their windows broken or were otherwise damaged Saturday. Here's a look at how protests are unfolding around the country on Sunday: Washington, D.C.: Historic St. John's Church near White House set ablaze As protesters gathered near the White House, flames were seen at the Washington, D.C., landmark that bills itself as ""the church of the presidents."" The fire, apparently an act of arson, was in the basement of St. John's Church, across from the White House, The Washington Post reported, and was extinguished. It occurred as a demonstration was taking place outside. The gathering had attracted as many as 1,000 Sunday, who faced off against officers in riot gear. The Episcopalian church in Lafayette Square boasts on its website that every U.S. president since James Madison has attended services there. Consecrated in 1816, the church also says the bell in its steeple, weighing almost 1,000 pounds, was cast in 1822 by Paul Revere's son Joseph. New York City: Protesters force closure of Manhattan Bridge; street fires, looting A crucial bridge into Manhattan was closed Sunday to make way for protesters, a day after hundreds of arrests including the mayor's daughter, it was reported. Street fires were being set and sporadic looting was reported Sunday evening after a day that saw large groups of protesters walk from Brooklyn to Manhattan over the Manhattan Bridge, which had to be closed, ABC7 in New York reported. Mayor Bill de Blasio's daughter Chiara, 25, was among 345 arrested, the station reported based on unnamed NYPD sources. The Daily Mail said it was able to confirm the arrest from a police report. She was reportedly arrested as part of a group of 100 demonstrators who refused to leave a roadway when ordered by police. Seattle: National Guard called to Bellevue; protesters block Interstate 5 National Guard troops were ordered to the Seattle suburb of Bellevue after reports of widespread looting. Washington Gov. Jay Inslee ordered 200 National Guard members to Bellevue after the mayor declared an emergency due to violence. Rioters broke into the Bellevue Mall and were stealing goods from stores. The thefts were part of a day of protests in the Seattle area that included shutting down Interstate 5, the same freeway that San Diego demonstrators blocked more than 1,000 miles away in southern California. Chicago: Gov. JB Pritzker activates National Guardsmen to assist police Vandalism reports continued to crop up in several city neighborhoods and some suburbs. The communities of Tinley Park, Crestwood and Oak Lawn alerted residents to stay home due to civil unrest. Many businesses boarded up. Gov. J.B. Pritzker said he activated 375 Illinois National Guard soldiers to assist local law enforcement with street closures. The downtown Chicago demonstrations that drew thousands started peacefully Saturday afternoon in a plaza, with protesters reading the names of black people who have died at the hands of police. But that gave way to violence and destruction that continued overnight Sunday in Chicago and elsewhere. Police used batons to beat back demonstrators as police cars were set ablaze and windows were smashed at businesses ranging from neighborhood convenience stores to high-end Michigan Avenue shops. Santa Monica, California: Unchecked looting as marchers confront police Looters took advantage of a large demonstration several blocks away to hit stores in the city's business district. In late afternoon, police were met with resistance when they tried to end a demonstration that had been peaceful. Demonstrators constructed a makeshift barricade in the middle of a street to protect themselves from non-lethal rounds fired by officers. The march had attracted hundreds along the city's main oceanfront boulevard. Though there were many police officers present for the march, looters were able to plunder stores with few to stop them. Cars were seen pulling up in front of stores, with looters running in to collect bundles of clothes and other merchandise, then running out. Boxes littered the sidewalk as thieves were seen transferring goods into plastic trash bags. A 5:30 p.m. PST curfew was announced due to the protests. The looting came despite the arrival of the National Guard troops in neighboring Los Angeles, which had seen extensive looting, vandalism and arson on Saturday. Murfreesboro, Tennessee: Brick thrown into business, police use tear gas A small but tense demonstration in Murfreesboro, Tennessee, appeared to have dispersed after demonstrators blocked traffic and threw a brick through the window of a local business, prompting police to respond with canisters of tear gas. About 50 protesters, many of whom appeared to be Middle Tennessee State University students, marched from Main Street toward Forrest Hall, a campus building named for Confederate general and Ku Klux Klan founder Nathan Bedford Forrest. Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee said protests in Murfreesboro are now “overt threats to public safety and property.” Police said an armored vehicle was vandalized and protesters have blocked traffic by lying in the street in an intersection. Officers responded by throwing canisters of tear gas to drive protesters out of the street. However, before the protest escalated, negotiations between police and protest leaders led to calm, then students and officers were seen walking together and posing for photos. – Nancy DeGennaro, Joseph Spears, Mealand Ragland-Hudgins and Brinley Hineman, Murfreesboro Daily News Journal Savannah, Georgia: Protesters chant 'Arrest the other three' during rally Thousands demonstrated against racism and the killings of black people at the hands of police Sunday in Savannah, Georgia. City leaders joined protesters who peacefully marched from Johnson Square to City Hall. “We need to make sure that we stop apologizing and we move from apology to action,” Savannah Police Chief Roy Minter said. At one point during Mayor Van Johnson’s speech, the crowd broke into a chant of “arrest the other three,” referring to other Minneapolis police officers who stood by while an officer knelt on Floyd’s neck. “Yeah, they should arrest the other three,” Johnson said. “We are tired of the mess and we want it to stop now. We stand here as a united community to say that we are standing with George Floyd and his family, because no man should ever have to die like that,” Johnson said. “We stand here united as a community to say that crooked police officers are called criminals. And in jail, they should be.” – Will Peebles, Dennis Knight, Mary Landers, Nathan Dominitz and Zach Dennis, Savannah Morning News San Diego: Police fire tear gas after being assaulted by rocks and bottles San Diego Police said they fired tear gas canisters Sunday after rocks and bottles were thrown at them. The department said in a series of tweets that the confrontation was taking place at Second Avenue and Broadway in the seaside city's downtown. ""Certain protestors continue to throw objects and vandalize our city,"" the department said in one post. ""The criminal behavior of these few is unacceptable. We are continuing to order the crowd to disperse."" Earlier, however, the department praised the peacefulness of most demonstrators. But it said it had to issue the order to disperse because of the dangerous actions of a few. At one point, demonstrators occupied Interstate 5, stopping traffic in both directions, the San Diego Union-Tribune reported. Philadelphia: Mayor Jim Kenney 'saddened and disappointed' beyond words Another day of street protests gave way to looting, with at least one police vehicle set on fire. Looters were running out of stores in the northeastern section of the city with armloads of merchandise. In the downtown, workers and volunteers swept up broken glass from windows shattered during riots the previous day. Graffiti was being removed. Mayor Jim Kenney said the mayhem “saddened and disappointed me beyond words, and I’m sure it saddened every Philadelphian who takes pride in their city.” He said those responsible “not only desecrated private businesses, they also desecrated the important message that was heard in the earlier peaceful protests.” Spartanburg, South Carolina: Passing motorists show support for protesters Chanting “No justice, no peace,” about 100 peaceful Spartanburg, South Carolina, protesters gathered at Barnet Park, drawing support from motorists who honked their car horns. “We want to take a peaceful stand to show support,” said organizer Kelvin Brown. “If we can all come together as a people, black and white, we can make a difference.” Many protesters said it wasn’t just Floyd’s death at the hand of a white police officer, or that it took days before the officer was arrested, that triggered anger. “We need to end the racist system,” said Curtis Pickens. “If you want all this to stop, real justice is what is needed. Stop the racial and social profiling. Stop hiring white supremacist officers.” “It’s time to stand up for what we believe in,” Isaiah Jordan said. “What happened to George Floyd terrorizes the whole nation. We’ve got to do something about it. I’m just sick and tired of young, black men dying."" --Bob Montgomery, GoUpstate.com Lafayette, Louisiana: Protesters want police to know 'we're human' Hundreds of protesters, some wearing protective face coverings, lined Lafayette streets to join a peaceful demonstration against police brutality. The protest, peaceful like others in Baton Rouge and New Orleans this weekend, began in the morning with protesters lining the streets to chant. “I am sick and tired of being sick and tired,” Lafayette NAACP President Marja Broussard said to protesters. “I have a message for law enforcement. The message is: we want you to know that we’re human just like you...We want you to know we have families. We’re human.” – William Taylor Potter, Lafayette Daily Advertiser Augusta, Georgia: Demonstrators chant 'No justice, no peace' Demonstrators chanted “no justice, no peace” as they walked along Washington Road in Augusta, Georgia. While “No justice, no peace,” was a popular chant among protesters, Sunday’s peaceful march was about showing strength through peace rather than through violence, organizers said. Latoya Lovett said she asked the Street Justice Council to help her organize the marches after hearing many Augusta residents talk about going to Atlanta to join protests there, which have turned violent after peaceful starts. “You can march in your own city, you can have a voice in your own city,” Lovett said. “You don’t have to go smash windows, you don’t have to go beat people, you don’t have to drop on the police.” Demonstrators were escorted by Richmond County Sheriff’s Office deputies who blocked off roads and intersections as needed. Sheriff Richard Roundtree was among those who helped guide the marchers and ensure safety for both them and the motorists. “We believe in free speech and protesting and voicing your opinion, as long as you do it in a safe manner,” Roundtree said. “As long as you’re doing that, we’re all for it.” – Will Cheney and Miguel Legoas, The Augusta Chronicle Jacksonville, Florida: Peaceful rally follows violent Saturday night of protests A peaceful demonstration was held Sunday outside the Duval County Courthouse. Then protesters started moving downtown and Jacksonville, Florida, police worked to keep them in certain areas. The cleanup of smashed store windows began Sunday around Florida after a night of unrest throughout the state’s cities. Jacksonville Sheriff Mike Williams said an unnamed deputy was either stabbed or slashed in the neck and was taken to a hospital for treatment Saturday night. A sheriff’s office spokeswoman would not comment on the deputy’s condition Sunday morning. A protest Saturday resulted in many arrests, “but we still don’t know how many or anything related to those arrests,” the sheriff said. – Sarasota News-Tribune Cincinnati: Police make 100 arrests after urging protesters to go home Police arrested as many as 100 people after using tear gas and imploring the crowd to go home ahead of a curfew. It ended a day that earlier featured a large crowd gathered at Inwood Park in Cincinnati to hear speakers as a rally, followed by a march. Organizers gave instructions about what to do if they are tear-gassed. The rally started with a fist-up salute and a song about the death Sam DuBose, shot by a police officer not far from the scene of this protest in 2015. Some Cincinnati City Council members tweeted from the rally. – Sarah Brookbank, Cincinnati Enquirer Contributing: The Associated Press",0.0
1622545722,2020-06-01 12:45:03,Church of the Holy Child among parishes to return to public Mass as Delaware begins to ease coronavirus restrictions: Photo gallery,http://thedialog.org/featured/church-of-the-holy-child-among-parishes-to-return-to-public-mass-as-delaware-begins-to-ease-coronavirus-restrictions-photo-gallery/,en,False,,655161,Dialog - United States,http://thedialog.org/,"BRANDYWINE HUNDRED – The coronavirus pandemic cost faithful Catholics 10 weeks of attending Mass in person, but that came to an end the morning of June 1, when several churches in the Diocese of Wilmington welcomed people back into their pews for the first time since March. The fact that a new reality has taken hold was immediately evident, however. All of those heading into the Church of the Holy Child in north Wilmington for 9 a.m. Mass went through a single entrance, where ushers instructed them to use hand sanitizer before proceeding to the pews. Every other row of pews was closed, and those that were available were marked with masking tape every six feet to show people where to sit. Before Mass started, the pastor, Father Michael Carrier, went through a list of changes made in the wake of the pandemic. There will be no singing at daily Mass, and only by the cantor on Sundays. The sign of peace is not happening for now. Communion would be available at the end of Mass, and distribution would be with outstretched arms on both sides. Of course, masks had to be worn in the parking lot and in church, and there was no socializing allowed. Still, Father Carrier told the approximately 35 folks who were in attendance, it was nice to be saying Mass in front of people instead of just an iPad. “It’s good to have you back,” he said. “I get to see your smiles.” During his homily, Father Carrier said he felt like “an empty-nester” whose children have returned home. “It has been lonely here the last 10 weeks as we set up the iPad. That’s our congregation,” he joked. “Today we come back as a family.” The priest also touched on the unrest and violence that has taken place in Delaware and across the country over the past several days in the wake of the death of George Floyd. The Minnesota man died a week ago while being restrained by police in Minneapolis, and protests have taken place since. Father Carrier called on Catholics to pray for healing and peace, and an end to racism. “We need to work, my brothers and sisters. We need to be the peacemakers. We ask Mary for her intercession,” he said. Parishioner Tina Gilbert was thrilled to be back at Holy Child. “Being away from church has been the hardest thing about the quarantine.” She said Father Carrier did a good job sticking to the rules that have been imposed, even if it was more uncomfortable for her to pray with a mask on. She has been watching Mass online, but getting back to church was a way for her to see some friends for the first time in months. “I wish I could talk to them, but it’s good to see everybody,” Gilbert said. Kathleen Deemer also has been tuning in on YouTube but was happy to get back into the routine of going to Holy Child. She’s curious to see how the weekend Masses work out since the church is limited to approximately 110 people under the current restrictions. She has been able to see her sister-in-law during the quarantine, but “the other people I haven’t seen since the last day of Mass here.” Neither Deemer nor Gilbert were able to secure their normal pew, but that is something they can live with. “I’m just happy to be here, no matter where I sit,” Gilbert said. After Mass, Father Carrier said having familiar faces in the church “put the joy back in your heart.” The congregation was about half the size of a normal daily Mass, but he understands some people might not be comfortable returning just yet. The staff at Holy Child has been busy making sure the church was properly marked off so they could resume services. He knows people have been watching online, but that is not the same for a big reason. “Being able to receive Eucharist – because they have not received Eucharist for all those weeks – that’s the main thing for a lot of folks, just that opportunity to do that again,” he said. The iPad, he added, will be going away, but not the streaming of Masses. Holy Child will have a camera installed soon, and the online availability will continue. “With an older parish, it affords those that aren’t able to come because of health or whatever under normal circumstances to be able to participate.”",0.0

1622579494,2020-06-01 14:41:13,Why do we save white monuments and let Black history rot?,https://whyy.org/articles/why-do-we-save-white-monuments-and-let-black-history-rot/,en,False,,82303,whyy.org,http://whyy.org/#spider,"The statue of former Police Commissioner and Mayor Frank Rizzo, on Saturday, became a target for protesters’ righteous anger as they defaced it, set it ablaze, and attempted to pull the hulking mass to the ground. By 8:00 a.m. Sunday, fresh from a power wash, the statue gleamed. It would soon be encircled by a dense blockade of more than 50 police officers and Pennsylvania state troopers—an extravagant use of taxpayer dollars, as some pointed out—a monumental statement refreshed, a projection of Philadelphia’s municipal priorities for restoring an image of order. As Queen Muse put it in an op-ed for Philadelphia Magazine calling for the immediate removal of the statue, “Whether the decision was intentional or haphazard, by rushing to have the Rizzo statue cleaned this weekend, Kenney sent a message to marginalized residents of this city that the issues that undergird their pain are not important to him.” Yesterday morning, I scrolled through my social media feeds and expressions of distress and dismay that the heart of our city, and cities across the country, had been torn to pieces. It is hard to see a place you love smashed up, bruised, burned. But it is unbearable to see Black fathers, mothers, sons, and daughters brutalized and killed by police on what feels like a never-ending loop, reduced to pixels and funneled straight into our most personal of devices, week upon week, month upon month, and year upon year. It goes without saying: damage to buildings is repairable, the murder and psychological torment inflicted by police brutality is not. As someone working in the field of historic preservation, I’m used to seeing—and am occasionally criticized for—posts that overemphasize buildings, affirming their importance, mourning their ongoing or imminent destruction. Windows were smashed, walls were tagged, and structures were burned this weekend, but this moment is not about buildings. This moment in time demands of us a more critical reflection. As we sweep up the glass, and assess the damage, we must reflect on what our environments—buildings, statues, and public spaces—symbolize, who they include and exclude, and what values they convey. In protests across the country this weekend, we saw anger directed at police precincts, corporate stores, government buildings, and unequivocal monuments to racism, like the Market House in Fayettville—where human beings were bought and sold—the headquarters of the Daughters of the Confederacy in Richmond, and here, the monument to a racist, bigoted former mayor that looms from Thomas Paine Plaza, a historical site of protest, and salutes City Hall. We need to take this as a moment to reflect on the legacy of racism in our country, the narratives and values that are embodied in architecture and monuments, and why they are being challenged right now. We need to remember how political uprisings in the past have brought about change. Part of what’s being communicated through this unrest is the fact that the current way of operating is disproportionately and violently harming Black Americans and people of color. This violence takes the form of police brutality, as it did this month for George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, but also manifests in lack of access to healthcare, disinvestment, predatory lending, poverty wages and income gaps, homelessness, ICE raids, and inhumane immigration policies. We can sweep up broken glass and restore the facades in Center City, but that doesn’t change the fact that during the 1950s and 60s, Philadelphia and other urban centers were left completely defunded and neglected during white flight, or that in the ensuing decades they have been taken back over, gentrified and tidied for a white audience, their spaces policed accordingly. “We are using the police force to protect a white icon when there are not police protecting black and brown families in this moment. @ddroyster https://t.co/BE7uSea9rm @FIAnational @powerinterfaith — Bishop Dwayne Royster (@ddroyster) May 31, 2020 Our cities and environments are shaped by prevailing value systems, by systems of power. And preservation—what we deem valuable and the “official” narratives we attach to it—is indelibly connected. Fixating on buildings at this moment is inappropriate. It’s not about restoring facades and restoring normalcy. We need to think about what these historic events say about where we are as a society. We need to work inclusively to rebuild our cities and institutions so that they work for all of us. Just as preservation recognizes that buildings embody and convey cultural values, it should recognize this kind of damage to them for what it is: the rightfully furious and desperate backlash to the failure of our system to recognize the humanity of all of our fellow citizens. Recognition matters. Interpretation matters. Who controls the narrative matters. How far would the resources that have been put towards protecting the statue of a racist go towards preserving sites related to Black history? Rasheda Phillips, creator of AfroFuturist Affair/Black Quantum Futurism and Community Futures Lab, pointed out the pattern of hand-off neglect that has defined much of the city’s approach to Black history to date. “They’re so worried about property but won’t protect the John Coltrane house, Dox Thrash house, the Checker club or any number of historical Black properties and monuments destroyed by the violence of developers and city neglect.” They’re so worried about property but won’t protect the John Coltrane house, Dox Thrash house, the Checker club or any number of historical Black properties and monuments destroyed by the violence of developers and city neglect. How does that work? — RP (@RPhillipsEsq) May 31, 2020 How can we progress from here? From a preservation and cultural heritage standpoint, there’s a lot of work to do. First, we need to reckon with the fact that the movement, particularly in Philadelphia, is overwhelmingly white. It shouldn’t be. Both formal preservation education and local advocacy efforts have to become more inclusive, accessible, and relevant. We can also ease back on the obsession with architectural purity, which favors high style architecture, wealthier neighborhoods, and places unnecessary burdens on lower income households and owners by imposing strict guidelines and review processes. We have to work to expand the basic criteria used to recognize places as important, which emphasize connections to important historical events, architects, and people, reinforcing all of the usual (white and male) historical biases. We need to come up with ways to recognize spaces that aren’t buildings, local institutions, buildings less than 50 years old, and places that undergo frequent change in order to survive. We need to include different narratives, invite new authors, and figure out how to communicate different stories in unexpected places, recognizing that there are far too few sites of “achievement” and “progress” and the sort of superlative, feel-good stories that we’re used to that represent all classes, races, genders, or sexual orientation. Intersecting identities have always informed who is and isn’t able to contribute, whose contributions are recognized, and whose are given credibility.",0.0

The chain drug store announced the closures in the wake of protests that began last week following the killing of George Floyd at the hands of Minnesota police. Amid the unrest, businesses in many cities have been broken into and looted. CVS told USA TODAY it does not have a complete list of the closed stores, due to the developing nature of the situation. The pharmacy chain confirmed while several stores have sustained damage, no employees were hurt during the protests. ""Each closed pharmacy’s phone system has been rerouted to a nearby CVS Pharmacy that is open so all patients will continue to have access to pharmacy care,"" said Amy Thibault, senior manager of corporate communications for CVS Health. ""We are continually monitoring protests as they occur in the communities we serve and will close stores, if needed, to help ensure the safety of employees and customers.""

The good news: You won’t automatically get put in handcuffs for heading to vote after 6 p.m. should the city extend its nightly lockdown into Tuesday. “Philly residents will not be arrested or prosecuted for going to or coming from voting tomorrow,” said District Attorney Larry Krasner. “No curfew is going to interfere with any voter going to the polls. Please do not let these circumstances dissuade you.” City Commissioner Lisa Deeley said her office is developing a contingency plan in the event that access to polling places — already reduced by nearly 80% by the pandemic — is hindered by ongoing protests or looting. That plan could involve relocating a polling location or funneling voters to another location, though details were scarce. A steep decline had long been expected for in-person voter turnout, even prior to the protests over police brutality and institutional racism. More than 1.8 million Pennsylvanians have been approved for mail-in ballots. The city’s top prosecutor said he didn’t think the unlawful activity would interfere with voters who still plan to vote in person. “Philadelphia is a tough city,” Krasner said. “I don’t think any of the looters out there are trying to steal votes. I think they’re trying to steal clothes.” But officials will still be carefully monitoring, watching for the usual array of voting concerns.",0.0

Dozens of police officers dressed in riot gear responded with what appeared to be tear gas or pepper spray, quickly pushing protesters off the major roadway and up onto an embankment near the Ben Franklin Parkway. Shortly after, many of those unable to scramble fully up the embankment were brought back down to the highway and into police custody. But the protest didn't stop there, continuing up onto the Parkway in a large public demonstration against police brutality. Protesters chanted ""Who do you protect? Who do you serve?"" in front of a line of Philadelphia police officers on bicycles while media helicopters circled overhead. Others laid on the ground with their hands up.

What's next? “That’s the biggest question,"" said Dashaun Buchanan, a 24-year-old West Philadelphia native. Buchanan was in his neighborhood Sunday night, when police officers used tear gas and rubber bullets to try and disperse crowds after the area around 52nd Street was badly looted and damaged. Now, he was sitting outside City Hall taking it all in. ""I wanted to record the aftermath and show people that here’s our new reality now,"" he said. ""Now that you displayed that demonstration, here’s what we’re left with. ""I get the frustration. I get the rage. I wish there was a different way that people went about how they displayed their emotions. But, also, at the same time, I’m not one to tell people how to display their rage."" CLEANING UP: Philadelphians took to the streets to clean up Sunday morning as their city prepared for more Buchanan said he didn't think the daily protests and riots could go on for days and weeks, and he credited a lot of the excess destruction to people being cooped up in their houses during the coronavirus pandemic. ""While I’m a big fan of protesting, I hope we can come together and form a plan,"" he said. Buy Photo Crowds gather on Benjamin Franklin Parkway in Philadelphia, Pa. on Monday, June 1, 2020 as part of a protest against police violence. (Photo: Jenna Miller/Delaware News Journal) That plan, he said, involves voting to select the people who can ""be the change within our community."" A police officer guarding the northwest corner of City Hall had a similar message to a heckler passing by around 11:30 a.m. Monday. ""Next time you vote, make sure you vote these guys out of office,” the officer said as he motioned toward the building behind him. Story continues below the photo gallery. The city said it would again enforce a 6 p.m. curfew Monday night and peaceful protests were already starting to begin shortly after noon. More than 400 people were arrested over the weekend. Sunday evening, a few hundred peaceful protestors marched from City Hall to West Philadelphia, and then to police headquarters before heading back to City Hall. Some of them later continued north on Broad Street, passing Temple University.

Health experts fear carriers of coronavirus, which causes the disease, with no symptoms could unwittingly infect others at protests where social distancing is simply not taking place. The merits of the protesters' cause ""doesn’t prevent them from getting the virus,” said Bradley Pollock, chairman of the Department of Public Health Sciences at the University of California, Davis. At least one protester in Tampa, Florida, is known to have COVID-19. Tampa Police Chief Brian Dugan, who expressed dismay last week about Floyd's death, tweeted Monday that five of his officers were exposed to the protester, whom he did not identify. Protesting – especially without a mask – can put people at higher risk for infection, said Dr. Michael Mina, an assistant professor of epidemiology at Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health. ""There's no doubt in my mind that these can become breeding grounds for this virus,"" he said during a Monday media availability. ""I would not be surprised to see in the next couple of weeks that we see increases that may be linked to protests."" Viral photos: A photo page of striking moments from the week’s protests. As businesses re-open, it will be difficult to figure out whether someone caught the virus at a protest or in some other encounter, Mina said. Hopefully, the fact that protests are taking place out of doors, will dilute the virus and reduce disease transmission, he said. Wearing a mask will help reduce infections, though it won't completely eliminate risk. ""If there's a floridly positive person who is coughing and spending a whole day around a lot of other people, that person might very well get other people sick despite having a mask on,"" Mina added, but ""there's a good chance that even homemade masks will actually do quite a bit to help people not get infected and not transmit."" There is historical precedent to suggest that viruses can be spread by large public gatherings. In September 1918, people in Philadelphia held a parade to celebrate the return of soldiers from World War I. The gathering of 200,000 people, crammed shoulder to shoulder, reignited a deadly flu epidemic, leading to massive closures and thousands of deaths, records show. Yet, there's a public health cost to not protesting the status quo, said Dr. Hillary Babcock, an infectious disease specialist at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, and immediate past president of the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America. ""Systemic racism also causes large public health impacts and public health risks for large portions of our population,"" Babcock said. She disagreed with calls for protesters to stay home to avoid fueling the outbreak. ""I don't think using public health as a reason to discourage protests after these events is really appropriate,"" Babcock said. ""It's a little disingenuous to say that the health risk from protesting is somehow bigger than the health risk at Lake of Ozarks (where people gathered for fun over Memorial Day weekend) or the practices that brought us to this point in the first place."" At least one reveler at the lake party tested positive for COVID-19, according to the Camden County Health Department. Others were advised to monitor for symptoms. Babcock said it is possible to minimize the risks of protesting, with masks, social distancing and asking sick people to stay home. Arresting people and putting them into close contact with others increases risk, Babcock said, as does spraying protesters with pepper spray, which causes violent coughing and can potentially spread the virus. Timeline: George Floyd protests: How did we get here? Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency room physician and former Baltimore health commissioner, said there is risk of longer-term effects in communities disproportionately affected by COVID-19. Wen was Baltimore's health commissioner when protests erupted following the 2015 death of Freddie Gray. The death triggered civil unrest in communities already burdened with deep-seated inequities, she said. ""When over a dozen pharmacies burned down and closed and stores were looted, it was community members themselves who were affected the most,"" Wen said. While protests over the past week following Floyd's death have highlighted police-community relations, demonstrators are also calling attention to social justice issues, including health disparities. ""The same communities that are already the most affected are potentially going to have an increase in the number of cases as a result of people gathering,"" Wen said. Melanie Campbell, president of the National Coalition on Black Civic Participation, said anger in the black community has been building for years. Floyd's death spurred them to take to the streets, even as the coronavirus has taken a disproportionate toll on African Americans. ""Black people are risking their lives protesting in the middle of a pandemic that’s killing black folks. That’s real,"" she said. ""There is no convenient time to fight back."" Meanwhile, state and local public health agencies plan to monitor for new COVID-19 cases. Any large gathering during a pandemic is a concern, said John C. Welch, director of partnerships and operations for the Massachusetts Covid Response project. Partners in Health, a Boston-based nonprofit, handles Massachusetts’ contact tracing of individuals infected with or exposed to the virus. Following such a large gathering, potential cases need to be monitored over two weeks, the virus’s incubation period. “The epidemic curve should guide the response and the phased reopening of society,"" Welch said. ""Until the epidemic is declared over, social distancing and wearing masks should remain the new normal."" Peter Pitts, president and co-founder of the Center for Medicine in the Public Interest, a nonpartisan research and educational organization, said he worries COVID-19 will take advantage of people gathering to protest police violence. ""Social distancing and social conflict are a very potent negative combination when it comes to spreading a virus,"" he said. ""The timing is highly unfortunate."" Public health concerns, which are usually complicated, can easily be drowned out by other ""sexier"" stories, he said, citing the recent SpaceX launch. But the virus ""doesn't cease to be a real threat because of other threats happening simultaneously,"" he said. ""That means we have to twice as smart and twice as dedicated and twice as focused.""

John Carney spoke with reporters Meredith Newman and Jeanne Kuang answering questions regarding the state's reopening efforts and local George Floyd protests. Delaware News Journal When President Donald Trump called governors ""weak"" on Monday for their response to this weekend's protests and urged them to arrest unruly protesters, Gov. John Carney described this moment hours later as a ""complete surprise."" ""It was a call like none other that I’ve been part of as part of these weekly calls on the coronavirus pandemic,"" Carney said. ""We didn’t really talk about it at all."" During this weekly teleconference, Trump chastised the governors for not stopping the looting and violence that occurred in their states.

""If you don’t put it down it will get worse and worse."" The president told the governors during the teleconference, which included law enforcement and national security officials, that they “have to get much tougher,” according to audio of the phone call obtained by CBS News.

(Photo: Jerry Habraken, Delaware News Journal) ""He went into what can't otherwise be described as a rant,"" Carney said, ""about what has happened in cities and states across the country ... and using incredibly strong language about really challenging governors to call out and include the National Guard to dominate the streets."" ""Not many, frankly, governors spoke up,"" Carney added. Like in cities across the country, Delawareans protested in Wilmington following the death of George Floyd, a black man who died after a white police officer in Minneapolis pressed his knee into his neck for about eight minutes. READ: Wilmington protest for Floyd turns violent; police order people off the streets In Wilmington on Saturday, a peaceful protest turned heated and eventually, as day turned to night, quickly transitioned to looting and rioting. The evening ended with more than a dozen businesses on Market and Shipley streets being damaged or looted. Carney said he had ""significant conversations"" this weekend with Wilmington Police Chief Robert Tracy and Delaware State Police Colonel Nathaniel McQueen about the potential need for the National Guard. He noted Wilmington's ""painful history"" with the National Guard stemming from its 9-month occupation in the city following the 1968 riots. Carney said he felt this weekend that the state had the necessary manpower with New Castle County and Delaware State Police to keep control of the situation in Wilmington. ""I think the numbers of strength on the street is an important one,"" Carney said, ""and it's one that's critical to stemming the violence and getting the streets under control.""

Health experts fear carriers of coronavirus, which causes the disease, with no symptoms could unwittingly infect others at protests where social distancing is simply not taking place.

Wearing a mask will help reduce infections, though it won't completely eliminate risk. ""If there's a floridly positive person who is coughing and spending a whole day around a lot of other people, that person might very well get other people sick despite having a mask on,"" Mina added, but ""there's a good chance that even homemade masks will actually do quite a bit to help people not get infected and not transmit.""

""Systemic racism also causes large public health impacts and public health risks for large portions of our population,"" Babcock said. She disagreed with calls for protesters to stay home to avoid fueling the outbreak. ""I don't think using public health as a reason to discourage protests after these events is really appropriate,"" Babcock said. ""It's a little disingenuous to say that the health risk from protesting is somehow bigger than the health risk at Lake of Ozarks (where people gathered for fun over Memorial Day weekend) or the practices that brought us to this point in the first place."" At least one reveler at the lake party tested positive for COVID-19, according to the Camden County Health Department. Others were advised to monitor for symptoms. Babcock said it is possible to minimize the risks of protesting, with masks, social distancing and asking sick people to stay home. Arresting people and putting them into close contact with others increases risk, Babcock said, as does spraying protesters with pepper spray, which causes violent coughing and can potentially spread the virus.

Delaware News Journal Accountability needed after demonstrations How sad viewing online the destruction by thugs and anarchists of Al's Sporting Goods Store, a Wilmington staple for 65 years. I remember my dad taking me there in the 1960s buying my first baseball glove — a Tom Tresh — and my first basketball —a Pennsylvania. Why weren't the police empowered to protect Al's property, the bar at 5th and Market or Morris Jewelers? To me, if I was thinking of opening a business in Wilmington, I would question the mayor and police chief's ability and willingness to protect my investment. I have lived in Wilmington for 45 years. I have two siblings who live in the city. I served in city government for 12 years. My oldest child works in downtown Wilmington. During my 12 years on Wilmington City Council, our authorized strength of the police department was 240. Now Chief Robert Tracy has in excess of 300 officers. After the earlier demonstrations, one at the Public Safety Building at 4th and Walnut and one at I-95 what did they think was going to happen next? Buy Photo A dumpster on the 900 block of Orange Street burns as looters break into businesses on and near Market Street in downtown Wilmington as protests against police violence grew into rioting Saturday. (Photo: WILLIAM BRETZGER, The News Journal) Looting is a crime and should be addressed as such. Why weren't the help of the state police, nor the National Guard solicited? I witnessed the National Guard assembling at Bayard School During the 1968 riots. They would patrol City Streets until Jan. 20, 1969. The peaceful demonstrators in Wilmington, and across America, should be commended. Those who were peaceful showed their respect for the Floyd Family. I hope that justice is served and systemic racism is eliminated. As is often is the case, far-left groups and radicals hijack these worthy causes, and wreak havoc and destruction. With the shutdowns for COVID-19, businesses did not need nor deserve this. In no way do I blame the rank and file of the police department. Management must be held accountable. — Robert F. Poppiti Sr., Wilmington Justice for all Justice For All I would like to read a follow-up article sometime this week on the arrest made in the looting of innocent business owners as they prepared to re-launch their businesses this week. George Floyd's death is a travesty and all who took part in his death should be punished to the fullest intent of the law. But so should these individuals who took it upon themselves to go out and purposely cause destruction to the very neighborhoods that the live in. ALL LIVES MATTER! — Michael Stanek, Wilmington Christina school referendum deserves support One of my relatives works in the Christina School District and has been talking about the upcoming referendum in June. Evidently, since a previous referendum did not pass, this district needs this referendum to pass this time. It appears that more senior citizens come out to vote and this is why the referendum did not pass the last time. To my fellow senior citizens: Please remember that the students in this district are the future. They will be the ones taking care of us if we are in the hospital or at a nursing home. They will also be the ones performing other important jobs that affect us. They need an excellent education in order to perform their jobs in the future.

John Carney spoke with reporters Meredith Newman and Jeanne Kuang answering questions regarding the state's reopening efforts and local George Floyd protests. Delaware News Journal Citing unspecified ""police intelligence,"" Gov. John Carney on Monday blamed out-of-state actors for escalating Saturday's police brutality protest in Wilmington, mentioning that a Washington state resident instigated one incident intending to provoke violence. He stated repeatedly in an interview with Delaware Online/The News Journal that many who participated in the protest, largely peaceful all day before turning into vandalism and looting in downtown Wilmington at night, ""were not from here."" Carney gave few details when asked. ""I can’t share law enforcement or police intelligence, but I do know of an unlawful thing that happened on Saturday night that was designed to create a larger, more violent outburst that was perpetrated by somebody that was from the state of Washington,"" he said. Buy Photo A garbage receptacle burns at 3rd and Market Streets in downtown Wilmington as protests against police violence grew into rioting Saturday.

There's no indication the person has been arrested. Karas said four people were arrested in the city Sunday morning, all from Wilmington. Two were arrested on charges of burglary, shoplifting and criminal mischief, and the other two are accused of resisting arrest. Delaware State Police Master Cpl. Melissa Jaffe wrote in an email that ""I do not have any information regarding"" Carney's statement.

""They just want anarchy and lawlessness, and they want to provoke the police into an altercation and they suck up folks locally with the rage,"" Carney said. ""It’s heartbreaking, frankly, and infuriating."" The question of whether protests in response to the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police are being instigated by so-called outside agitators has arisen around the nation. BACKGROUND: Wilmington protest held in response to George Floyd's death: Watch Since last week, protests have erupted in numerous U.S. cities over the killing. Some have turned violent, while in many cities police have fired tear gas and rubber bullets on protesters and journalists. U.S. Attorney General Bill Barr on Saturday said that ""groups of outside radicals and agitators are exploiting the situation to pursue their own separate and violent agenda."" Many in Wilmington have also blamed those from out-of-state or outside the city for Saturday night's escalation. Nationwide, some activists say focusing on that theory distracts from the protests for civil rights. Carney said the state's law enforcement will learn more about those alleged agitators' ""techniques."" He said those include using firecrackers and setting fires. ""There were diversionary outbreaks around the city, to divert resources from the downtown area to neighborhoods and Trolley Square and other places,"" Carney said.

1622672765,2020-06-01 17:15:15,New round of protests have begun in Philly,https://whyy.org/articles/new-round-of-protests-have-begun-in-philly/,en,False,,82303,whyy.org,http://whyy.org/#spider,"A large protest against police brutality that flooded parts of Center City Monday mostly dispersed as night began to fall on Philadelphia’s third day of demonstrations denouncing the death of George Floyd at the hands of police in Minnesota. Tensions reached a peak when the group blocked traffic in both directions of I-676. State Troopers intervened, releasing multiple tear gas canisters into the crowd as part of its effort to clear people off the expressway. Catherine Letine, 30, was among those marching. “It’s been mostly peaceful and the police were the first to strike on us,” said Letine, a life-long Philadelphian who is white. “We have no weapons. We’re unarmed. We’re here peacefully and they have continued to use force. And it will only get worse I’m sure.” State Police, in a statement to NBC10, said tear gas was used because some protesters pelted police with rocks and bottles. Protesters rapidly disbursed, heading off the highway back towards 22nd Street and scattering in multiple directions. Dozens of protesters, some lined up against a median on the highway, were detained by police. The tense situation led to the shutdown of the Benjamin Franklin Bridge in both directions. Throughout the day, helicopters whirred above, with people holding signs with messages such as “black lives matter” and “defund the police.” As of 6 p.m., Philadelphia is under a mandatory citywide curfew. It will not lift until 6 a.m. Tuesday. During those hours, people can only leave their homes to go to work at essential businesses or to seek medical attention or police assistance. The larger unrest hit cities across the country after Floyd died when being arrested and restrained by Minneapolis police for allegedly using a counterfeit bill. Officer Derek Chauvin was seen on video with his knee on Floyd’s neck for nine minutes. Chauvin, who had previously faced more than 15 conduct complaints, has been fired and charged with third-degree murder. Three other officers part of the altercation have also been fired. Saturday and Sunday both featured large, mostly peaceful protests during the day, followed by vandalism, property damage and looting in the afternoon and evening. Each day has seen moments of both harmony and extreme tension between protesters and police. On Monday, some police officers knelt on the steps of the police headquarters in a show of solidarity. In other moments, officers have seemed to show little respect for people’s right to assemble, ramming them with bicycles and pepper spraying without provocation. On Sunday, a WHYY reporter covering a peaceful march was tackled and arrested without warning. On Monday, one protester, an African American woman who asked not to be named, said she felt “defeated” and “hurt” based on her interactions with police. “I’ve been flipped off. I’ve been told ‘Fuck you’ by these police officers…” she said. “A police officer drove by in his car and sprayed mace out of his window towards my friends. It’s very disgusting to see how they act.” Since Saturday, the first day the city implemented the mandatory curfew, officers have arrested 161 people for being on the street past 6 p.m, according to police. The vast majority were city residents. Police arrested another 257 people for failure to disperse. The majority of those people were also city residents. Trouble in Fishtown Starting in the early evening, a group of roughly a hundred people, mostly white men, patrolled Girard Avenue in Fishtown, confronting a group of protesters. Some of the men carried bats. Others had golf clubs and billy clubs. Protesters had signs. One man was overheard by a WHYY producer as saying: “I’m ready to fuck shit up. You know, I’ve been looking for a fight for the past 6 months.” Another man holding a hatchet had an angry interaction with a protester in the street. “I’m here to protect this neighborhood,” he said. One guy tells a cop: “im not here to make your job harder. I want to protect you.” A guy in a trump hat raised his fist and greeted his friend by saying “white man!” — Jon Ehrens (@jwehrens) June 1, 2020 ‘No one has listened for years’ Earlier in the day, another group of protesters gathered outside City Hall, with many calling for the removal of the Frank Rizzo statue bolted to the steps of the nearby Municipal Services Building. Barricades now cross JFK Boulevard in between MSB and City Hall, blocking access to the statue. Members of Philadelphia police department, as well as the National Guard, who were brought in to assist local police as civil unrest continued for a third day in a row, stood behind the barricade. On the outside, protesters chanted slogans and burned sage. Mayor Jim Kenney said over the weekend that the Rizzo statue will be removed more quickly than planned, likely within a month. On the opposite side of City Hall, the group Human Rights Coalition 215 held its own protest by the statue of black intellectual and activist Octavius Catto, calling for a variety of national and local reforms.",0.0

This was in response to the death of George Floyd, an unarmed black man who died while being arrested in Minneapolis. A white police officer put his knee on Floyd’s neck for several minutes while Floyd was being held face down on the street. The Minneapolis officer has been charged with murder. Master Corporal Mark Hoffman, spokesman for the Dover Police Department, said police officers were present throughout the day and night, and most of the protests were peaceful. “Outside of the traffic issues and that part of things, the majority of the crowd was relatively law- abiding,” he said. “It was a small percentage that took advantage of the situation and began looting and throwing rocks and water bottles.” Hoffman gave the Dover Post a general timeline of how the protests happened May 31. The timing is approximate, and this story will be updated as more information becomes available. What happened Noon - A group of people met at Legislative Hall and began a peaceful protest with signs and calls for action. That group grew and headed to the Dover Police Department. 1 p.m. - Protesters rallied around the police station, “expressing their views based on the current situations that we’re facing in the country today,” Hoffman said. It lasted about a half hour. Everyone was peaceful and law-abiding, he said. 1:30 - 3 p.m. - Protesters returned to Legislative Mall and the downtown area. WDEL reported that organizer DeAndre Valentine broke up the protest after about three hours. “Me as a leader of that group, that peaceful protest group, I broke it up. We said what we had to say. Let this not be one day of our voice, but many days of our voice,” Valentine said in an interview with WDEL. 5 p.m. - A crowd gathered again and came to the Dover Police Department with more people and cars around the station. “They were more heightened in emotions in front of the police department,” Hoffman said. Protesters talked with Dover police officers in the back parking lot. They agreed to leave when police escorted them off the property, and no arrests were made. Hoffman said there were moments of unity, too: “We had people thank us and shake our hands,” he said. After about 45 minutes, the protesters went back to the downtown area. A group went to the intersection of Route 13 and Division Street, and Dover police shut down that intersection and parts of the highway to keep drivers and protesters safe, Hoffman said. 6 p.m. - Mayor Robin Christiansen declared a state of emergency and a curfew for the city. The curfew is from 9 p.m. until 6 a.m. every night until further notice. “While it is with every intent we support the First Amendment Right to protest, those rights end when violence and destruction imposes on the rights of their fellow citizens,” Christiansen said in a statement. Hoffman clarified that Dover police can enforce the curfew, but the main purpose is to reduce traffic on roads and the amount of people out in the city. “It’s a great tool to ensure the safety of the whole city,” he said. 7 p.m. - Protesters made their way north to the Dover Mall area. Police traveled with the crowds. They received reports of glass breaking and looting at Forever 21 and a sneaker store in the mall, which has not been identified yet. “We were able to retake control of the mall relatively quickly,” Hoffman said. The crowd that was in the Dover Mall parking lot then moved back onto the highway near the Lowe’s and Chick-Fil-A. A rally happened outside the Delaware State Police headquarters. Master Corporal Melissa Jaffe said she has not received any reports of injuries. The Delaware State Police were assisting Dover police. “There was a large Delaware State Police presence there last evening at our headquarters,” she said. Meanwhile, some people broke glass and looted the Cricket Wireless store just south of the mall. People broke into the Home Depot and other stores, and the police will release more specific information on damages later. Hoffman confirmed that one person was arrested for throwing rocks at a police car and another for stealing from Home Depot. No police officers were injured, and no one has reported any injuries from the protests, Hoffman said. While the majority of protesters were peaceful, “there were parts that got very tense and downright ugly last night,” he said. The Dover Police Department released a statement on Facebook June 1. Part of it read, “Moving forward, we are committed to working with gatherers who wish to exercise their First Amendment Rights in a lawful manner and holding important conversations with community leaders and our citizens about important issues involving the criminal justice system. ""We also would like to thank our law enforcement partners who came to assist us last night: Delaware State Police, Delaware State University Police, Dewey Beach Police, Milford Police Department, South Bethany Police Department, and Smyrna Police Department. ""Be safe, stay well, and spread a little kindness today and every day.” Today’s press conference The mayor hosted a press conference this afternoon, June 1, at City Hall. Police Chief Thomas Johnson, council members, state representatives and leaders from the NAACP and Interdenominational Ministerial Alliance of Dover and Vicinity were there. Christiansen said a major reason the peaceful protests turned destructive was an influx of protesters who came into Dover from outside the city and state. He stood by his decision to issue a curfew and emergency declaration to protect all citizens. “We are not going to tolerate family businesses, businesses that are owned by females, minorities or any business to be jeopardized,” he said. “Why should someone who is not from Dover, Delaware, come here and destroy someone’s dreams? It isn’t going to happen on my watch.” Christiansen briefly mentioned a case where a Dover police officer resigned after he was charged for assaulting a black man in 2015. When asked if there is a review board to prevent something like George Floyd’s death from happening in Dover, he said the city and police have learned from the previous officer who used excessive force. “I brought it to the public’s attention, [and] we took the appropriate action...to guarantee that the Dover Police Department was above and beyond reproach in the use of deadly force. We revamped the complaint forms, we have tracked deadly use of force,” he said. “At this point, we don’t need a review board. We self-police and that’s the way that it should be.” The Rev. Rita Paige represented IMA and other clergy in the community. She said the city needs to focus on the youth and include them in the planning process. “Young people feel as though they have no voice, that they have not been heard, that no one is listening to them,” she said. “They react in ways that we don’t want them to react. We try to teach love, respect and obedience, but yet, they are not experiencing that and not feeling as though they are having equal opportunities or receiving equal justice. Minneapolis proved that.” Anne Smith, president of the Central Delaware NAACP, called for a review of the police department’s use of force, a ban on using a knee to hold someone down and transparency of police records that show repeated complaints against officers. “I want to say to the citizens, to stand up, to tell the truth and to love. Step out on faith and good courage, and get involved in the community committees,” Smith said. In an earlier interview, Councilman David Anderson, 4th district, said he hopes future protests and activism would happen in partnership with city leadership. “Dover does things right,” Anderson said. “We know how to have adult conversations in Dover. We will keep both freedom and dignity to speak up in our city. We will keep order and protect our citizens, and people can have faith in that.” To get involved, Christiansen said anyone can call the mayor’s office at 736-7005.",0.0

The officer has been charged with third degree murder and manslaughter. One speaker over the weekend at City Hall in Philadelphia was Minister Rodney Muhammad, president of the Philadelphia chapter of the NAACP, the country’s oldest and largest nonpartisan civil rights organization. He joined Morning Edition host Jennifer Lynn to talk about the turbulent weekend in Philadelphia. – Minister Muhammad, welcome. Well, thank you for having me. Good morning. Pleasure to have you, sir. There are many layers to our story of police brutality and the fight for justice for all people. What is unique about the anger and sadness being expressed in Philadelphia now? Well, to be honest, for Black America, when we saw the horrific ordeal of that video of George Floyd’s life being strangled right out of him, it was another addition to a long set of chapters of police brutality that we suffered in this country. We have never resolved this problem. The police, they represent the enforcers of a racist system. That’s the universe that Black people live in. So it’s the straw that broke the camel’s back. Some say it’s the drop of water that caused the cup to overflow. We reached the boiling point, a tipping point. We can see that America, Black and white, is upset about this. I think that people are open to conversation. It doesn’t look like this is going to go away as fast as some may have hoped. Yeah, and you addressed a peaceful crowd yesterday in front of City Hall. What message did you most fervently want to share with the people who gathered with you? There’s been a problem in our struggle even since the ‘60s and well-meaning whites who have worked hard with Dr. King and others to try to end some of the …{inaudible} they saw Black people living in and not being able to vote. There are some things that happen to Black people that are very clear to white America that injustices are being done to us. But there are other systemic things that are very, very difficult for white America to see, as they have expressed. And because of the difficulty in seeing the disparities and the unequal way we’re dealt with, it becomes difficult to really do something effective about police brutality. So our message yesterday was at this time, we should be having a conversation about the difficult decision of reassigning white police officers to white areas of the cities of America, and reassigning officers of color to those communities that are identifiably Black or African American and brown people until something is done on a large scale therapeutic level. We’ll keep counting bodies in the morgue because [of] the sickness that is expressed by too many white officers. We don’t have time to treat it [with] on-the-job training while they are overseeing Black people in neighborhoods primarily populated by us with a whole host of disadvantaging circumstances. Now, many officers, of course, are doing their jobs and being respectful of you. We believe that there are good officers of every stripe and color or ethnicity, if you will. They’re just not good enough to stop the bad. Yes, sir. Sir, is there a promise? I’m sorry to interrupt. There is a promise to this nation for justice for all. What meaningful reform can you work toward to help keep bad cops accountable? I know you do such work. Well, we have to think of the long-term game, obviously, legislation and policy. Those are things that the NAACP focuses on. And that’s why they work in the courts to roll back what we call civil rights gains, because they know that in a very solid way, when we can get laws changed, when we can get a policy established, we have that basis for which to work from [within] the law. Even Dr. King said, the law can’t make a man love me. He said religion and education must do that. He said, but the law can keep him from lynching me, and I think that’s pretty important, too. So the NAACP is focused on a long game, and our long game is we got to do something in November to change the personnel in government. And tomorrow is primary Election Day for those who were planning to go to the polls in some of the neighborhoods in Philadelphia that have been under duress. That is a difficult journey to get to those polls. Well, it is. And you know, the NAACP, along with others, we’re saying, “Look, you came out in numbers because you want to be heard. Come out in even greater numbers that you can be counted. Come out and vote.” Sir, you are a minister; you counsel people; you comfort them. For those who are sad, who are scared, men and women, young and old, Black and white. Where is their hope? Well, our hope is in righteousness. And the only psychology that’s gonna work for white America and Black America today is truth. If we’re not going to be truthful, we’re not going to repair the psychological state that white supremacy has done to make someone who’s white feel supreme only because the color of their skin is white. To make someone else feel less than only because the color of their skin is black. And we’ve both been here over 400 years. And we’ve trained ourselves in these kinds of dark dichotomies and these dynamics. So there has to be a real re-education process. Short of overhauling the police departments in America that have grown very powerful through their unions… Now, it’s not likely that that’s going to happen for a long time. And that’s why I’m calling for a reassignment of officers who are white from areas that are predominantly identifiably Black. And, you know, there is hope. If we start taking some of the right steps, there is hope. If white America and Black America have the real kind of conversation, there is hope. If we change the relationship from a colonizer/colonized relationship, or a slave master/slave relationship, to one where we’re on equitable terms and we live like human beings here. Thank you. Thank you so much. It can get better. I agree. Thank you so much. Minister Rodney Muhammad, president of the Philadelphia chapter of the NAACP. Thank you for your time this morning.",0.0

Asbury Park Press News of a peaceful demonstration Monday evening in Rehoboth Beach to protest the death of George Floyd temporarily closed Tanger Outlets and other large box stores along Coastal Highway. The Cape Gazette reported Monday that the organizer, Dover resident Martoryo Cannon, had planned the protest with her daughter via social media but ""decided to cancel because of the threat of vigilantes showing up as they did in Wilmington and Dover."" “We were trying to do a peaceful protest but these vigilantes are coming, playing like they're protesters but they're not,” Cannon told the Cape Gazette. “They're doing all this looting and rioting, and we don't want to be associated with that.” While the protest Cannon organized was reportedly rescheduled, a few dozen demonstrators gathered peacefully around the Rehoboth Bandstand at 6 p.m., while others watched from the benches. The death of Floyd, the Minneapolis man who died of asphyxia after former police officer Derek Chauvin knelt on his neck for several minutes while he was handcuffed on the ground, has sparked protests against longstanding police brutality and excessive use of force — especially against people of color — across the nation. Dozens more protesters joined the demonstration Monday night to march from the Bandstand to City Hall. They held signs that read ""Silence = Compliance,"" ""Until the color of your skin is the target, you will never understand,"" and ""I can't breathe,"" the same words Floyd pleaded while on the ground under Chauvin's knee.

Bags of mulch were piled up to block off entrances to Lowe's in Lewes. Cars that tried to turn into the home improvement store were stopped by masked employees and told Lowe's was closed. At Home Depot, coworkers bid one another farewell just after 5 p.m., saying, ""I'll see you on the other side."" ""Police are asking that we notify local businesses of the possible protest,"" a Rehoboth Beach notice read.

Krasner also sought to assuage concerns that police might intimidate would-be voters from approaching polling places. Officers, he said, are prohibited under Pennsylvania law from being within 100 feet of a polling place, unless they’re specifically called there to quell some kind of disturbance. Deeley added that if there are, in fact, disturbances that render polling places inoperable, the city is working with the Pennsylvania Department of State to come up with contingency plans. She declined to say what those plans might be, and said they’d only be rolled out if necessary. A Department of State spokesperson didn’t immediately respond to a request for more information. David Thornburgh, who heads the election watchdog group the Committee of Seventy, said even before the events of the last few months, he was expecting relatively low turnout. With the presidential primary decided well before Pennsylvania’s election, he noted, there were few “marquee” races left. “With each succeeding wave of anxiety and concern — pandemic, civil unrest — you chip away a few percentage points,” Thornburgh said. “So it’s probably going to be an even lower-turnout election, which is not good for democracy.” He’s not the only one thinking along those lines. Even prior to the wave of civil unrest, Philadelphia political leaders were anticipating a steep dropoff at the polls. Democratic City Committee Chairman Bob Brady said the limited number of polling locations and fears over spreading the new coronavirus were a recipe for low turnout. In past elections, Brady’s ward in Philadelphia’s Overbrook section boasted 42 polling locations. Then, after city election officials slashed locations citywide by nearly 80% in response to the pandemic, it dropped to just five locations. “I don’t think many people are gonna come out,” Brady said Saturday. “I’m telling my committee people: There’s no reason to go to the polls.” But Brady also criticized the mail-in ballot process, which he called discriminatory against older voters. He said he pushed to allow for dropoff of mail-in ballots at local polling places on primary day, instead of at a limited number of sanctioned drop-box locations. But there were legal obstacles, he said. “Why can’t you take that ballot to poll?” he asked. “You take your ass to the poll, you can’t take your ballot? Take your ballot with your ass.” Thornburgh estimated that restrictions notwithstanding, around 60 to 70% of votes cast in Philadelphia will be by mail. That’s only possible thanks to Pennsylvania’s newly-expanded election code, which allows voters to cast ballots by mail without an excuse, and gives them more time to return those ballots. As far as Thornburgh is concerned, that’s a good thing. But state and county officials have also periodically raised concerns about the commonwealth’s new election logistics. County election offices are now dealing with huge increases in the number of mail-in ballots they have to process, and have said for months that the extra work — along with the brand-new voting machines many counties are using for the first time — could slow down results. Officials could not immediately be reached to respond to Wolf’s last-minute deadline extension, but it will likely give them more time to tally ballots. Secretary of State Kathy Boockvar said Monday that she has been closely in touch with the Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency, and will be monitoring protests and other issues “hour by hour.” “We will absolutely inform the public of any changes as soon as we become aware of any,” she said. “So far, there are no changes that have been identified at this point.” Philly suburbs predict ‘normal proceedings’ Philadelphia isn’t the only place that has been dealing with unrest on top of existing, pandemic-related election challenges. Protests broke out sporadically across the counties that surround the city and in some cases, became contentious, In Montgomery County, which saw looting at the King of Prussia Mall, Public Affairs Manager Terresa Harris said that county commissioners “had no concerns about civil unrest at the polling places.” She said they would operate as planned Tuesday, with no additional precautions. The same goes for Delaware County. On Sunday, local media outlets reported a large police presence in Upper Darby as businesses were looted and vandalized. But a county spokesperson said that would not affect in-person voting sites set to operate during Tuesday’s primary. “As of this afternoon, those locations do feel confident that they can have normal proceedings,” said Adrienne Marofsky, Director of Public Relations for Delaware County. She added that law enforcement will be monitoring. In Bucks County, constables will be monitoring polling sites. “You can’t really station a police officer inside a polling place, legally,” county spokesperson Larry King noted. The other issue election officials are bracing for are masks, which are required at polling stations. King said workers there will have additional masks on hand for people who do not have one, and are adding additional measures for residents to cast votes if they cannot, or will not, don a protective mask. “They’re not going to be denied the right to vote, obviously,” King said.",0.0

Help us report on the pandemic. As hundreds gather each day across Philadelphia to protest the death of George Floyd, allegedly murdered by a Minneapolis police officer, Philly and its surrounding counties are poised to move from the state-designated “red” phase of coronavirus shutdown to the less restrictive “yellow” phase. Despite the rules against large gatherings in both phases, city and state officials have signaled that, as of now, Philadelphia will stay the course. “The plan is for red counties, including Philadelphia, to move to yellow on Friday,” Nate Wardle, a spokesman for the Pennsylvania Department of Health, said Monday. It will likely take a week or two to see how the ongoing protests over Floyd’s death will affect the spread of the novel coronavirus. But the protests aren’t the first instances of large crowds gathering in violation of Philadelphia’s stay-at-home order. Across the state over Memorial Day weekend, public health officials worried that celebrations among stir-crazy Pennsylvanians would cause an uptick in coronavirus cases and slow the progress the commonwealth has made in mitigating the spread of the virus. Over the next few days, the city might start to see such an increase, said Philadelphia Health Department spokesman James Garrow. Though Mondays have been slow days for test results throughout the pandemic because of weekend lag times at labs, he said the day’s 252 positive tests showed no sign of an uptick yet. City Health Commissioner Thomas Farley has consistently said that moving into the “Safer at Home” phase scheduled for Friday will depend on a variety of data points, including hospital space, testing capacity, and new positive case numbers. The testing metrics could be affected by the shrinking number of testing sites due to the protests: On Monday and Tuesday, all city testing sites and community health centers were set to be closed as a part of the shutdown of all city services. Several pharmacies, such as CVS and Rite Aid, also closed locations, further reducing the number of test sites in Philly. If the number of tests drops substantially, that could affect the plan, according to Garrow, as could a spike in cases that would likely be a result of Memorial Day activities. “Based on what we’re seeing, the mayor and Health Department will make that decision in the next few days, and in coordination with Governor Wolf,” he said. As of now, the state will stick with the plan for Philadelphia’s transition to “yellow” on Friday, along with all the other remaining “red” counties in the state.",0.0

The presumptive Democratic nominee leads Trump 53%-43% among registered voters, the poll found. On March 25, the same survey showed a much tighter race, with Biden leading by just 2 percentage points, 49%-47%. And Trump's overall approval rating has slipped since the March 25 poll, which for the first time in his presidency found more Americans approving (48%) than disapproving (46%) of the job he was doing. In May's poll, his approval rating dropped 2 points to 46% and his disapproval rating jumped 7 points to 53%. Democratic and Republican voters were firmly behind their party's standard-bearers, 95% and 94%, respectively. But Biden had a wide lead among registered independents, 56%-39%, after leading by just 1 point with those voters two months ago. The candidates' support showed sharp divides by gender and race. Trump led by 8 points among male voters (52%-44%) and Biden held a 28-point advantage among female voters (62%-34%). Trump led by 9 percentage points among white voters, 53%-44%, while Biden was backed by 89% of black voters and 69% of Hispanic voters. Trump's slide has coincided with the spread of the coronavirus across the U.S. When the previous poll was released, there were fewer than 70,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases in the U.S. and the death toll was under 1,300. There are now nearly 1.8 million confirmed cases in the U.S. and more than 104,000 people dead from the disease. The poll of 1,001 Americans was conducted May 25-28 and therefore does not reflect the full impact of recent anti-police brutality protests on voters' opinions. The survey has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points. 'The symmetry is remarkable':Wisconsin perfectly divided between 2 parties – and over Trump Opinions flip on coronavirus response The last ABC/Post poll found the majority of Americans (51%) approved of Trump's handling of the outbreak, with 45% disapproving. Those numbers have virtually flipped in two months, with 53% now saying they disapprove of his response to the crisis and 46% saying they approve. When asked who they trusted more to handle the government's coronavirus response, 50% said Biden and 42% said Trump. But they were evenly split 47%-47% when asked who they trusted more to manage the economic recovery from the pandemic. The lockdowns and stay-at-home orders meant to slow the spread of the virus have devastated the economy and driven unemployment to levels not seen since the Great Depression. The weakened economy undermines a cornerstone of Trump's reelection pitch, which has centered on a thriving stock market and low unemployment. In a November 2018 ABC/Post poll, 65% of Americans had a positive view of the economy and 34% had a negative one. Now, those numbers are inverted, with 34% holding a positive view of the economy and 65% a negative one. Biden leads Trump 66%-30% among Americans who have been laid off or furloughed since the outbreak started. A 52% majority still approves of Trump's handling of the economy, down from 57% two months ago. Many states are expanding mail-in and absentee voting in response to the outbreak. Trump has strongly objected to those efforts, claiming, without evidence, that it would lead to massive election fraud. Despite the president's concerns, 65% of Americans support an increase in voting-by-mail-in, while 30% are opposed. An enthusiasm gap between Trump, Biden An area where Trump holds an advantage over Biden is in the enthusiasm of his supporters. Eight-seven percent of the registered voters who said they favor Trump in the election said they will ""definitely"" vote for the president and 90% said they were enthusiastic about doing so.

And then it became clear. President Trump wanted to walk from the White House through the park to the Episcopal church. Camera crews scrambled to keep up with him as he strode through the park, followed by his daughter Ivanka and her husband Jared Kushner, along with Attorney General William Barr and other administration officials. Trump stopped briefly outside the church and held up a Bible. “We have the greatest country in the world,” he said. “Keep it nice and safe.” The impromptu visit came just after Trump delivered remarks at the White House, declaring himself “your president of law and order” and demanding that governors deploy National Guard units and “dominate the streets.” St. John’s Church opened in 1816 and is known as “the Church of the Presidents,” having hosted every U.S. president since James Madison. On this occasion, however, the president’s visit was unannounced, and church authorities were furious that the White House did not bother to alert them beforehand. “There was no reaching out, no sense that it would require some sort of authorization before using the church as a backdrop in that way,” said The Right Rev. Mariann Edgar Budde, Episcopal Bishop of Washington, with oversight responsibilities for the church. When the president held up the Bible, without praying or quoting a verse appropriate for the moment, Budde was further incensed. “It almost looked like a prop,” she told NPR. “That is the most sacred text of the Judeo-Christian tradition. It speaks messages of love, of God, love of neighbor. I was outraged that he felt that he had the license to do that, and that he would abuse our sacred symbols and our sacred space in that way.” The Bible teaches us to love God and our neighbor; that all people are beloved children of God; that we are to do justice and love kindness. The President used our sacred text as a symbol of division. — Mariann Budde (@Mebudde) June 2, 2020 The church has long been known for its support of social justice causes, and in the hours before the president showed up, clergy and lay volunteers had been ministering to the protesters in the plaza. Protests, some of them violent, had occurred around the church on previous nights, and the church was briefly in danger on Sunday after a fire started in the church basement. A former St. John’s minister, Gini Gerbasi, was among those attending to the protesters in front of the church when the police moved in. “We were literally DRIVEN OFF of the St. John’s, Lafayette Square patio with tear gas and concussion grenades and police in full riot gear,” she wrote in a Facebook post. “PEOPLE WERE HURT SO THAT [President Trump] COULD HAVE A PHOTO OPPORTUNITY IN FRONT OF THE CHURCH!!! HE WOULD HAVE HAD TO STEP OVER THE MEDICAL SUPPLIES WE LEFT BEHIND BECAUSE WE WERE BEING TEAR GASSED!!!!” In a statement Monday evening, the Episcopal Church Presiding Bishop Michael Curry joined in the criticism of Trump’s visit. “This evening, the President of the United States stood in front of St. John’s Episcopal Church, lifted up a bible, and had pictures of himself taken,” Curry said. “In so doing, he used a church building and the Holy Bible for partisan political purposes. This was done in a time of deep hurt and pain in our country, and his action did nothing to help us or to heal us.” The church visit was praised, however, by a member of Trump’s Evangelical Advisory Board, the Rev. Johnnie Moore. “I will never forget seeing @POTUS @realDonaldTrump slowly & in-total-command walk from the @WhiteHouse across Lafayette Square to St. John’s Church defying those who aim to derail our national healing by spreading fear, hate & anarchy,” Moore tweeted.",0.0

Trump took a tough line with the governors, saying he was putting Attorney General Bill Barr in charge of the federal law enforcement response. The president said the White House was “strongly looking for arrests.” “You have to arrest people and you have to try people. And they have to go to jail for long periods of time,” the president said. “If people are running amok, you have to dominate. If you aren’t dominating, you’re wasting your time,” he said. “They’re going to run over you, you’re going to look like a bunch of jerks.” “It’s a movement, if you don’t put it down it will get worse and worse,” Trump said. “The only time it’s successful is when you’re weak and most of you are weak.” The call followed yet another night of unrest Sunday over the May 25 death of Floyd and came on the same day that the president urged in a Rose Garden address that the governors deploy National Guard troops to quell the unrest. “If a city or state refuses to take the actions that are necessary to defend the life and property of their residents, then I will deploy the United States military and quickly solve the problem for them,” he said. In the nation’s capital, where U.S. Secret Service uniformed officers, military police and other law enforcement on Monday fired tear gas on peaceful protesters outside of the White House, Trump said he was already “dispatching thousands and thousands of heavily armed soldiers, military personnel and law enforcement officers to stop the rioting, looting, vandalism, assaults and the wanton destruction of property.” While some governors, such as South Carolina’s Henry McMaster, a Republican, praised Trump’s calls for a crackdown, others took umbrage at the president’s combative tone and questioned his authority to unilaterally deploy federal troops to the states. In Michigan, where police and protesters have skirmished in Grand Rapids despite many demonstrations remaining peaceful, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, called the president’s remarks “dangerous” and said they should be “gravely concerning to all Americans.” The president’s comments, she said, “send a clear signal that this administration is determined to sow the seeds of hatred and division, which I fear will only lead to more violence and destruction.” “We must reject this way of thinking. This is a moment that calls for empathy, humanity, and unity,” Whitmer said in a statement. “This is one of the most challenging periods in our nation’s history, but as Americans, we must remember our enemy is racial injustice, not one another.” The Republican governor of Massachusetts, Charlie Baker, said he wasn’t surprised by the president’s “incendiary words.” “At so many times during these last several weeks, when the country needed compassion and leadership the most, it simply was nowhere to be found,” he said following the phone call with Trump. “Instead, we got bitterness, combativeness and self-interest. That’s not what we need in Boston, it’s not what we need right now in Massachusetts,” he said as his voice cracked with emotion, “and it’s definitely not what we need across this great country of ours either.” Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, a Democrat, called the president’s remarks the “rantings of an insecure man trying to look strong after building his entire political career on racism.” On the subject of the deploying of federal troops, Democratic New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo told CNN that he would respond to such an offer by saying “Thank you, but no thank you.” “He wants to make this about looting because he doesn’t want to talk about the killing of Mr. Floyd,” Cuomo said. “[He] doesn’t want to really talk about racism and discrimination.” In the conference call, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, a Democrat, warned the president that the “rhetoric coming out of the White House is making it worse,” to which Trump snapped back, “I don’t like your rhetoric that much either.” Pritzker, speaking later on CNN, remarked: “Well, it’s illegal. He can’t do it. We won’t request military assistance here in the state of Illinois. I can’t imagine why any governor is going to do that. This is, it’s ridiculous,” he said. Should the officers in Breonna Taylor case be fired? Beshear says he was among first to call for independent probe. There are “major concerns” about the one officer who shot through her apartment windows, he says. He does not answer the question outright. — Marcus Green (@MarcusGreenWDRB) June 1, 2020 Kentucky Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear was reportedly not on the call with the president. Beshear was instead talking with the mother of Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old African American resident of Louisville who was killed in March by police executing a “no knock” warrant. The president did praise one Democratic governor for his response to the unrest — Minnesota’s Tim Walz, who fully mobilized National Guard troops on Saturday to supplement law enforcement. But at another point in the call, Trump called Minnesota “a laughingstock all over the world.” Walz said Monday that he responded by saying: “No one’s laughing here. We’re in pain. We’re crying. We saw a man lose his life in front of them and our challenge is that this is about social trust, social compacts and reestablishing faith in the people who are there to serve them.”",0.0

Bucks is using machines that require voters to fill out a paper ballot, then feed it into a scanner. County spokesman Larry King said commissioners don’t yet know the scale of the problem, but have seen sporadic issues at polling places across the county that have affected ballots for both parties. The solution, he said, is rudimentary: Commissioners have instructed judges of elections to have their poll workers simply cut a sliver off of the ballot with scissors or a paper cutter, which usually solves the problem. Officials believe the issue is the fault of the vendor in charge of printing the ballots, Reliance Graphics. King said he voted in person in Doylestown this morning and noticed that his own ballot was a little wide for the scanner. He eventually forced it in, and the machine accepted it. He added, county officials have instructed judges of elections who aren’t able to cut down ill-fitting ballots to place them in an emergency ballot box, which will be brought to the county elections office in Doylestown and tallied there. Too-big ballots aren’t the only factor adding an element of chaos to Bucks’ election. Late last week, county officials submitted an emergency petition to the county’s Court of common Pleas, asking for voters to get more time to return mail-in ballots due to sluggish mail. The judge, James McMaster, is expected to issue a decision Tuesday afternoon. Bucks, which has so far seen largely peaceful protests, wasn’t included in Gov. Wolf’s order extending the deadline to return mail-in ballots. “I guess we weren’t violent enough,” King said. He said officials are hoping Wolf’s deadline extension in the six other counties will sway the judge to rule in Bucks’ favor. Poll workers report good turnout in West Philly Despite predictions of low turnout, the scene at polling places around West Philadelphia was generally unaffected by coronavirus fears or worries of depressed turnout from citywide civil unrest, poll workers said. “With all the rallies, all the disease, I’m happy to see the turnout,” said Marvin Robinson, 4th ward committee person, from Universal Bluford Charter. “With the riots going on, I didn’t even think we were going to have an election, but thank God that the people believe in their democracy.” Lines inside at James Rhoads School and Heston School, and socially distant lines outside the School of the Future, were a result of consolidated polling places, but also unusually high turnout. “It’s more people coming out on the primary,” said the judge of elections, Katherine Gambrell. “It’s higher than it normally would be this time a day just for my one division.” By about 11:30 a.m., 131 people had voted in the 6th ward 15th division. There were some hiccups. Gambrell said she arrived at her polling place at 6:15 a.m. to no tables or chairs. There was also no guidance about how to combine polling places, which caused confusion. Jacqueline Brower showed up to her normal voting location at Heston School near 54th Street and Lancaster Avenue, only to be told her polling place had been moved. Sandra Williams, judge of elections at that location, called a voting hotline and helped Brower learn where she should vote. That happened at locations across West Philly, poll workers said. Some voters downplay coronavirus concerns If Pennsylvania’s primary election had been held last month, Plymouth Meeting resident Kathie McDade wouldn’t have been willing to vote in person. “But I’m getting a little more comfortable now that the [COVID-19] numbers are going down, so I’d rather do it in person,” she told WHYY reporter Ximena Conde earlier today while voting at Central Montco Technical High School. Some of the voters who showed up said they weren’t too concerned about the health risks posed by voting in person. “I feel like we are pretty safe where we are,” said Claire Ward, who voted at Belmont Elementary School in Lower Merion Township. “We live, maybe, five blocks from here and I feel like the whole pandemic thing is a little overdone.” Donna Kelly is the judge of elections at Central Montco Technical High School. Only one precinct was added to the school, for a total of three, though a staffing shortage and steady stream of voters kept poll workers busy. “This doesn’t seem to be terribly different from other primaries,” said Kelly. “Probably 10% of our voters did mail-in. Here we probably see 25% turnout during primaries, so it’s looking like it’s running about the same for us.” Sanitizing the clipboards was the only minor delay voters reported, but Kelly said it hasn’t posed a problem for those casting ballots. “People are understanding that we might not be able to rush them through,” she said. Poll workers report early difficulties As the morning unfolded in the Philadelphia area, poll workers reported low turnout and some technical issues. “It’s just a mess in here,” said Geneva Carter, a longtime election judge who was stationed at Vare Recreation Center in South Philadelphia on Tuesday morning. “People don’t even know where to vote.” Carter said turnout was about half of what it would normally be. At Belmont Hill Elementary in Montgomery County, WHYY reporter Ximena Conde said the typical, early-morning rush never took place. A voting machine operator also told Conde that younger poll workers had replaced some of the older volunteers who usually work on election day. Robin Kolodny is a voting machine op. here and a polisci prof at Temple. She says the avg. age of those working the polls at this Montco location has dropped.

Asbury Park Press Like the many journalists harassed during George Floyd protests, Gustavo Martínez Contreras was doing his job. New Jersey's leaders must draw a line. At 9:40 p.m. Monday, Asbury Park Press reporter Gustavo Martínez Contreras filmed an extraordinary moment as police and protestors took a knee together during a rally for George Floyd in Asbury Park. Thirty minutes later, Martinez Contreras was being loaded into a police van, detained for doing his job (see the above video). This is happening all over the country and it’s bad for democracy. Real bad. According to the Nieman Foundation for Journalism, U.S. police arrested or attacked journalists more than 100 times from May 28-31, as protests over the killing of George Floyd spread throughout the country. Some perspective on that: Over the last three years, U.S. Press Freedom Tracker documented between 100-150 such incidents per year. Buy Photo Gustavo Martínez Contreras (Photo: (Photo: Tanya Breen)) So police did a year’s worth of harassing of journalists in four days. Then there were Monday’s incidents: A reporter and photographer for The News Journal of Wilmington, Delaware, and a reporter for the Philadelphia Inquirer were detained by police for two hours while covering protests in Philadelphia. A Cincinnati Enquirer reporter was handcuffed and detained while covering a protest in Cincinnati. An Atlanta Journal-Constitution reporter was arrested while covering a protest in Atlanta. Student-newspaper reporters from Ohio State University were pepper sprayed by cops in Columbus after repeatedly identifying themselves as news media. An Australian T.V. reporter and her cameraman were accosted by police in Washington, D.C. Capping off this spasm of suppression was the arrest of Martinez Contreras. Prior to the rally, Asbury Park officials had expressly exempted media members from the 8 p.m. curfew. Martinez Contreras was filming the post-curfew arrest of protesters and did not appear to be obstructing police at all when an officer approached him and yelled, ""you're under arrest"" and ""get your f---ing hands behind your back."" He was released several hours later with a summons for failing to obey an order to disperse. Later Tuesday morning, New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir S. Grewal addressed the matter. ""I know that officers face enormous challenges while maintaining order during a chaotic situation. But I've discussed this matter with local authorities and they will be dismissing the charge today,"" Grewal wrote on Twitter. ""We will also figure out why this happened and make sure it doesn't happen again. Because in America, we don't lock up reporters for doing their job."" Altogether, the scope of law enforcement’s harassment of the media over the past week might be unprecedented in the history of American journalism. The trusted place to find the best home service providers. Find local pros. That’s a real slippery slope. Locking up and beating down the press is the go-to move of the world’s most repressive regimes. There’s a reason why President Trump repeatedly slams the media as “the enemy.” It’s a pesky check on government power. His attempts at demonization appear to be working. Now is the time for responsible leaders in New Jersey to ask questions and demand answers about why a reporter was hauled away for doing his job. Draw a line before this becomes a trend here like it has elsewhere.

Kenney, Outlaw decry vigilantism in Fishtown “I think there’s a shift coming, and I’m happy to be a part of it. Nothing makes me happier to see so many different people of different races out here marching together. I think when Martin Luther King said, ‘I have a dream,’ this is what he meant,” a Black protester told NBC-10 reporter Tim Furlong. Mayor Jim Kenney condemned the vigilantism in the city’s Fishtown neighborhood that resulted in several injuries Monday night. At a press briefing Tuesday, the mayor said such actions would not be tolerated going forward. Monday night, a group of men wielding baseball bats gathered around the city’s 26th Police Precinct as a protest group approached the neighborhood. According to video of the scene, they said they were there to protect police. The men physically clashed with protesters, resulting in at least one hospitalization. “Their actions were antagonistic and made a bad situation worse. We do not condone vigilantism,” said Kenney during his Tuesday afternoon press conference. “ I’m glad police moved to disperse. I’m not happy about how long it took.” “I am also disturbed by reports that some officers were seen high-fiving and taking photos. That is unacceptable,” Kenney said. Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw reiterated Kenney’s sentiments, saying protecting police is not necessary. “I didn’t ask them to do that. I don’t welcome that. I don’t invite them back. We don’t need them,” she said. “To be clear, we do not condone any acts of violence. We don’t take sides. Our mission is to always protect all persons.” Outlaw also addressed Monday’s confrontation on I-676 yesterday, when a splinter group of a couple hundred protesters broke away from a planned marching route and spilled into the Vine Street Expressway. Police used tear gas to disperse and arrest the group. Outlaw said protesters were throwing objects at the police and putting themselves and others in harm’s way by being on the freeway. “The [tear gas] option was selected … when it became evident that no other options would be effective. We will uphold right to assemble and protest. Will can not tolerate acts of violence,” she said. When asked about the alleged use of pepper spray by a police officer against a protester, Outlaw suggested some internal discipline may be imposed after an investigation. “This incident and others will be fully investigated by internal affairs,” she said. “I will not allow the actions of some individuals to undermine efforts we are trying to make as an organization moving forward at this time.” At the same briefing, U.S. Rep. Brendan Boyle (D- Pa.) made comments critical of President Donald Trump’s statements Monday. “What the president of the United States said and did last night is wrong, and only inflames the situation,” said Boyle. “Perhaps this is like Charlie Brown and the football: I ask President Trump to please refrain from pouring more gas on the fire. It affects people’s lives here in our community.” Boyle also is asking Congress to reconvene soon, saying, “If there is an absence of leadership in the White House, it’s time for Congress to step up.” “In times like this, we all matter and what we say matters,” he said. “We are ripping ourselves apart and the whole world is watching.

The bishop who oversees St. John’s is among the critics. “He used violent means to ask to be escorted across the park into the courtyard of the church,” Bishop Mariann Edgar Budde of the Episcopal Diocese of Washington tells NPR’s Morning Edition. “He held up his Bible after speaking [an] inflammatory militarized approach to the wounds of our nation.” “He did not pray,” the bishop continued. “He did not offer a word of balm or condolence to those who are grieving. He did not seek to unify the country, but rather he used our symbols and our sacred space as a way to reinforce a message that is antithetical to everything that the person of Jesus, whom we follow, and the gospel texts that we strive to emulate … represent.” Every president since James Madison has visited St. John’s Church, which opened in 1816 and sits across the park from the White House. Despite that longstanding relationship, Budde says her diocese had no warning of Monday’s visit. “There was no reaching out, no sense that it would require some sort of authorization before using the church as a backdrop in that way,” Budde told NPR’s Tom Gjelten hours after the incident. The president had used the Bible, and her church, as a prop, she said. “I was outraged that he felt that he had the license to do that, and that he would abuse our sacred symbols and our sacred space in that way,” the bishop told Gjelten. Within hours, the White House had assembled footage of the brief outing into a triumphant video that shows the president pumping his fist as he strides past a row of riot police, culminating in him standing in front of the church. Set to swelling orchestral music, the video shows nearly no sign of the destruction and debris that days of intense protests have wrought near the White House. The president, accompanied by his daughter Ivanka, several Cabinet members and Secret Service agents, walked to St. John’s nearly 30 minutes before Washington’s just-installed 7 p.m. curfew was to begin – timing that added to the chaos and confusion among demonstrators and that incensed Mayor Muriel Bowser. “Shameful!” Bowser said via Twitter, saying that after “federal police used munitions on peaceful protestors in front of the White House,” the city’s police force’s job of keeping the peace would be made more difficult. I imposed a curfew at 7pm. A full 25 minutes before the curfew & w/o provocation, federal police used munitions on peaceful protestors in front of the White House, an act that will make the job of @DCPoliceDept officers more difficult. Shameful! DC residents — Go home. Be safe — Muriel Bowser #StayHomeDC at 7 pm (@MurielBowser) June 2, 2020 When the federal force rushed at protesters outside the White House, journalists were also pushed out. Officers attacked Australian reporter Amelia Brace and also hit cameraman Tim Myers, prompting Australia’s Prime Minister Scott Morrison to call for an investigation. The scene played out on live TV, during Australia’s breakfast-time Sunrise show. “While live on air, Myers was struck in the chest by a riot shield and Brace was clubbed with a police baton,” Australia’s 7NEWS reports. “Our Ambassador should be certainly making representations on behalf of these Australians who effectively been assaulted…for doing their job” – Leader of the @AustralianLabor Party @AlboMP speaking after @Channel7 journalist & cameraman were hit. https://t.co/rCG56KbYRw #7NEWS pic.twitter.com/CUslYLfYes — 7NEWS Sydney (@7NewsSydney) June 2, 2020 Brace tells Australia’s ABC that she repeatedly identified herself as a journalist as officers quickly closed in on them during the rush to clear a path for Trump. “Despite that as I ran away, clearly stating that we were media, with my cameraman with a camera on his shoulders, I was hit across the back with the baton,” she says. “We were then fired upon by the National Guard with those rubber bullets, who are the exact people I had shown my media pass to … and then we ended up getting tear-gassed.” The situation, she said, was “absolutely terrifying.” “I also managed to get a rubber bullet to the backside, and Tim got one in the back of the neck, so we’ll have a few bruises tomorrow — but we’re feeling perfectly safe,” Brace says. Shock and anger over the incident led U.S. Ambassador to Australia Arthur B. Culvahouse Jr. to issue a statement saying, “Freedom of the press is a right Australians and Americans hold dear. We take mistreatment of journalists seriously, as do all who take democracy seriously.” Trump’s use of force to allow him to walk across the park has also prompted Arlington County, Va., to pull its police officers out of the nation’s capitol. The county had sent a police contingent to help keep peace in Washington. But it says the officers were put in a dangerous position that exposed them and others to risk “for a purpose not worthy of our mutual aid obligations.” “All ACPD officers left the District of Columbia at 8:30 p.m. Monday,” Arlington County says. The church has suffered damage during the unrest in Washington against police violence, including a fire that was lit in its basement. While Budde is thankful to first responders who put out that fire, she says she wants the focus remain on the death of George Floyd and others who have died at the hands of police. “I want to acknowledge the loss of property, but in no way equate it with the loss of life,” she said. “I want to be a church that stands in solidarity with those who are making peaceful protest.”",0.0

Across the nation, protests in response to George Floyd's death at the hands of Minneapolis police have been followed by chaotic confrontations between protesters and police and in many cases, deployment of tear gas and rubber bullets. In Wilmington, it didn't come to that. Police were largely restrained — day and night. Protesters said police allowed them to control their own crowd for most of the day and negotiate an end to more heated confrontations. Shaheed Banks, who said he's been treated poorly by police in the past, spoke at the initial rally at Rodney Square. Afterward, as he helped lead the crowd on a march to the Wilmington Police Department headquarters, he found police flexible. ""An officer told us, 'Sir, I'm taking your lead,'"" Banks said. ""And I respect that. They actually let us protest and let us police ourselves."" Banks, along with protesters Keith James and Hyland Henry, said they worked alongside police to de-escalate conflict when some threw rocks, argued with officers and smashed a police car. Buy Photo Wilmington Police Chief Robert Tracy, right, speaks with protesters in front of the Wilmington Police Department Saturday, May 30, 2020. (Photo: Jerry Habraken, Delaware News Journal) BACKGROUND: 'Not just a black thing anymore:' Wilmington protesters demand justice for George Floyd When a handful of protesters were detained by police at the station, demonstrators negotiated for their release. When police were concerned about growing tension, they allowed Henry onto the station's roof to address the crowd. ""They said they don't want this to escalate and we need to move,"" he said. ""I said, 'If you let me talk, I can move the people.'"" He then helped lead the crowd toward the Riverfront and I-95. Wilmington Police Chief Robert Tracy did not make himself available for an interview about the police's handling of the day and night's protests, despite multiple requests made through Mayor Mike Purzycki's office. Gov. John Carney in an interview with Delaware Online/The News Journal on Monday said Wilmington officers were asked to be restrained, ""to not get sucked into"" what he said were out-of-state activists' ploys to provoke police retaliation. Carney did not provide evidence for that claim, citing unspecified ""police intelligence."" OUTSIDERS: Carney says Wilmington protesters inciting violence 'were not from here,' gives few details Edward Maguire, an Arizona State University criminologist who studies police responses to protests, said communication with influential protest figures is a sign of ""a real success."" ""There are always people who are perceived as influential by the crowd and those are the people who police should be having conversations with them, asking them what they want and approaching them from the perspective of facilitation rather than control,"" Maguire said.

The Wilmington crowd was next met on the highway by a row of Delaware State Police patrol cars and troopers holding long guns, which Henry, a protester, criticized as inappropriate in front of peaceful protesters who kneeled on the highway. Despite moments of tension during that impasse, James said he and others had peaceful exchanges with the troopers, asking police to denounce the Floyd killing and put the guns away in exchange for the crowd to leave. Buy Photo Members of the Delaware State Police remove their guns and put them away after negotiating with protesters on I-95 Saturday, May 30, 2020, in Wilmington. (Photo: Jerry Habraken, Delaware News Journal) James, who is running for state representative in the 10th District, and others led the crowd back to the police station, where they had a similar exchange with Tracy and Purzycki. ""Then we left from there, as we said we would,"" he said. From there, some of those group leaders, including Henry, went home. But crowds moved to downtown Wilmington's Market Street, where the demonstration took a turn. Some protesters began shattering windows. Others decried it. Wilmington police showed up in riot gear, which some in the crowd said would inflame the situation. BACKGROUND: Wilmington protest for Floyd turns violent; police order people off the streets A row of officers holding shields and batons moved to block off portions of Market Street near vandalized businesses after each act, resulting in standoffs with groups of protesters. When the crowd moved along to target other businesses, officers followed and repeated the blockade, but did not make arrests. Buy Photo Protesters stand against Wilmington Police on Market Street Saturday, May 30, 2020, in Wilmington. (Photo: Jerry Habraken, Delaware News Journal) Tracy was seen on the ground throughout the day and night. Purzycki said he was on the phone with Tracy twice an hour until midnight. Wilmington eventually called in backup from other agencies. Police should balance restraint with arresting protesters engaging in vandalism and looting, Maguire said. ""The answer is not to move in with an overwhelming show of force, shoot less-lethal munitions and chemical agents, and make mass arrests,"" he said. ""But make very targeted arrests, while simultaneously communicating to the rest of crowd that's behaving lawfully, 'You guys are good.'"" As night fell and crowds shifted west from Market Street to the adjacent Shipley and Orange streets, the situation quickly devolved with even less intervention from police. On Shipley Street, crowd members chased after and broke the car window of a driver passing by. Market Street businesses were broken into and looted from their rear doors on Shipley Street.

(Photo: Jerry Habraken, Delaware News Journal) One was Sam's Discount Market, a beauty supply store. Manager Rolando Rojas on Monday echoed complaints of other city business owners who said police should have intervened. ""When things really got worse I don't understand why they didn't call the National Guard,"" he said. ""Or make it more of a police presence."" Carney on Monday said he had ""significant conversations"" this weekend with Tracy and Delaware State Police Colonel Nathaniel McQueen about the potential need for the National Guard. He noted Wilmington's ""painful history"" with the National Guard stemming from its nine-month occupation in the city following the 1968 riots. Carney said he felt this weekend that the state had the necessary manpower. BACKGROUND: Carney reacts to Trump calling governors 'weak' for response to protests ""I think the numbers of strength on the street is an important one,"" Carney said, ""and it's one that's critical to stemming the violence and getting the streets under control."" Police began ordering people off Market Street around 9:30 p.m., blaring out orders from an armored vehicle followed by more than a dozen officers.

Police orders eventually came up Shipley Street, too. ""This is an unlawful assembly. You must leave now. Get off the street,"" the officer said over the loudspeaker at Shipley Street. ""If you are on the street, you will submit to arrest."" Wilmington police later said they had arrested four people Sunday morning. Maguire said police must help facilitate peaceful protests, and ""cannot stand by and watch people loot and break things and steal things."" Banks, the protester who spoke at Rodney Square, said he was glad police stood down Saturday night. The creative director of Katlego Boutique, a clothing store off Market Street which was undamaged, Banks said he left the protest as night fell because he did not want to take part in vandalizing businesses.

(Photo: Jenna Miller/Delaware News Journal) MORE TO THE STORY: Why weekend protests turned violent, and will it change anything? He did not judge others who did, saying the actions were explainable by the crowd's outrage over police brutality. ""I think the approach the police took was correct,"" he said. ""You can't fight violence with more violence. It just creates more turmoil."" Reporters Isabel Hughes and Meredith Newman, and visual journalist Jerry Habraken contributed to this report.

Those sparks have landed in a tinderbox assembled over decades of economic inequality, now made worse by the coronavirus pandemic. Minneapolis police officers initially confronted the man — George Floyd — on suspicion that he’d used a counterfeit $20 bill to buy cigarettes. The viral video of what followed captured an individual tragedy. But it’s set against a backdrop of poverty and discrimination that have long colored relations between law enforcement and the African American community. African Americans are worse off than whites by almost every economic measure. And that divide has only deepened during the pandemic that’s sent the country into its worst economic downturn in generations. A survey by the Federal Reserve last year found that even in good times, African Americans are less able to pay their monthly bills than whites or Latinos. That’s hardly surprising, since median income among African Americans is 41% lower than that of non-Hispanic whites. Blacks are also 40% less likely to own their homes than whites — depriving many African American families of an opportunity to build wealth. The gap in homeownership is particularly stark in Minneapolis. A study by Zillow, the online real estate company, found black homeownership in the city lags more than 50 percentage points below the white rate. “It tells us that there’s racism baked in to the housing market,” said Andre Perry, a fellow at the Brookings Institution and author of Know Your Price: Valuing Black Lives and Property in America’s Black Cities. Income disparity, segregation, and racial redlining have all contributed to low national levels of homeownership among African Americans. Although blacks made housing gains in the 1990s and early 2000s, that was reversed by the subprime mortgage crisis, which led to a wave of foreclosures. Before the pandemic struck, African Americans were enjoying a strong job market. The black unemployment rate in February was 5.8% — near a 50-year low, though still higher than the white rate. Since then, unemployment for all racial groups has soared to double-digits. But the black-white gap has not noticeably worsened. African Americans who are working, however, are more likely to hold jobs that put them at risk of infection. A survey by the Labor Department found that in 2018, less than 20% of African Americans held jobs they could do from home, compared to about 30% of whites. Higher risk of on-the-job exposure to the coronavirus is compounded by African Americans’ higher rates of diabetes, heart disease and other conditions that are thought to contribute to more severe cases of COVID-19. “There have been epidemics in the black community that have existed for generations before COVID,” Perry said. “COVID accentuated and exposed those epidemics.” Just as the pandemic puts unequal health outcomes under a microscope, the video of George Floyd’s last moments illuminates the frustration brought about by generations of economic hardship. “That action really symbolized the knee on the neck of black homeowners and renters,” Perry said. “It represents the employers who don’t provide the kind of benefits and wages that will lift African American communities.” He suggested the demonstrations taking place across the country, five months before a national election, provide an opportunity for candidates to spell out how they would deal with these challenges. “If we don’t address the structural inequality,” Perry said, “we’ll be right back in the same place when the next inevitable crisis hits.”",0.0

Jenna Miller and Jeff Neiburg, members of our newsroom, were detained after showing police their press credentials and being told, ""I don't believe you."" They were detained for a curfew violation, even though members of the media are exempt from that order, and were held on buses for about 2 hours before they were released. Buy Photo Crowds gather on Benjamin Franklin Parkway in Philadelphia, Pa. on Monday, June 1, 2020 as part of a protest against police violence. (Photo: Jenna Miller/Delaware News Journal) These detentions were an affront to the First Amendment and Miller and Neiburg's rights as journalists — as well as citizens. We believe — firmly: Journalists should not be roughed up. Journalists should not be detained. Journalists should not be arrested. Journalists should not be charged. Journalists should be allowed to cover demonstrations. Journalists are allowed to cover demonstrations. Demonstrators are allowed to protest. We do not condone violence. We do not condone looting. We also do not condone aggressive police tactics that cross the line and become brutality. We do not condone hate. We mourn George Floyd. And all the dozens of other African-Americans who have died at the hands of police. We do salute police — like those officers in dozens of other communities across America — who have worked with demonstrators to maintain peace. We salute officers who've joined in protests. We also salute our colleagues, across our own USA TODAY NETWORK and those who work for other outlets, who are bravely covering these demonstrations amid a pandemic. Miller and Neiburg were not alone on Monday: Gustavo Martinez Contreras, a reporter at the Asbury Park Press who covers communities at the Jersey Shore for the USA TODAY NETWORK, was arrested and detained while covering a protest Monday night. A Cincinnati Enquirer reporter was handcuffed and detained while covering a protest in Cincinnati. An Atlanta Journal-Constitution reporter was arrested while covering a protest in Atlanta. Student-newspaper reporters from Ohio State University were pepper-sprayed by cops in Columbus after repeatedly identifying themselves as news media. An Australian television reporter and her cameraman were accosted by police in Washington, D.C. A CNN correspondent covering rioting in Minneapolis was arrested during a live broadcast. All of these are deeply regrettable. This is a moment to reflect on the power of the First Amendment, which is always our north star: Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.

Trump and First Lady Melania Trump traveled across town Tuesday for a brief visit to Saint John Paul II National Shrine adjacent to The Catholic University of America. The shrine is a place of prayer for Catholics but welcomes people of all faiths. The Trumps posed for photos in front of a statue of Saint Pope John Paul II outside the shrine and stood silently for a few minutes, hands clasped in front of them. They did not make remarks. Washington Archbishop Wilton D. Gregory slammed the presidential visit in a statement shortly before the Trumps' arrival. “I find it baffling that and reprehensible that any Catholic facility would allow itself to be so egregiously misused and manipulated in a fashion that violates our religious principles, which call us to defend the rights of all people even those with whom we might disagree,” Gregory said in a statement. Trump also is scheduled to sign an executive order on international religious freedom on Tuesday. Trump's visit to the shrine comes just one day after he walked across Lafayette Park next to the White House and posed for cameras outside St. John's Episcopal Church, which suffered slight damage after it was set on fire by protesters late Sunday night. Violent protests have erupted in Washington and dozens of other cities across the country following the death of George Floyd, a black man in Minneapolis who died in the custody of police. Former police officer Derrick Chauvin has been charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter in Floyd's death. Critics hammered Trump because police used tear gas and shields on protesters in Lafayette Park, essentially clearing a path for the president to walk to the historic building known as the church of presidents. The show of force came roughly half an hour before a 7 p.m. curfew was to take effect in Washington. ""Tear-gassing peaceful protesters without provocation just so that the President could pose for photos outside a church dishonors every value that faith teaches us,"" said a joint statement from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, said in a speech Tuesday in Philadelphia that the St. John's event proves Trump is ""more interested in serving the passions of his base."" ""When peaceful protesters are dispersed by the order of the president from the doorstep of the people’s house, the White House – using tear gas and flash grenades – in order to stage a photo op at a noble church, we can be forgiven for believing that the president is more interested in power than in principle,"" Biden said. Church officials protested that Trump did not call them about his plans to visit to St. John's on Monday. Mariann E. Budde, bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Washington, which includes St. John’s Episcopal Church, told CNN she was outraged by the use of tear gas to get people out of the way for a photo op. ""The president just used a Bible, the most sacred text of the Judeo-Christian tradition, and one of the churches of my diocese, without permission, as a backdrop for a message antithetical to the teachings of Jesus and everything that our churches stand for,"" she said. Bishop Gregory noted that Saint Pope John Paul II was “an ardent defender of the rights and dignity of human beings"" and ""certainly would not condone the use of tear gas and other deterrents to silence, scatter or intimidate them for a photo opportunity in front of a place of worship and peace."" White House officials said Trump did want to pay his respects to St. John's, which suffered a basement fire during protests Sunday. The president also wanted to leave the White House grounds to prove he was not “in the bunker“ because of the protesters, said one official who requested anonymity to discuss the president’s communications strategy. The president was particularly angry when word got out that the Secret Service escorted him to the bunker of the White House during protests just beyond the gates of the executive mansion on Friday, the official said. After the St. John's visit, the White House put out a statement saying protesters had been repeatedly warned to exit the park ahead of the 7 p.m. curfew. “The perimeter was expanded to help enforce the 7 p.m.curfew in the same area where rioters attempted to burn down one of our nation’s most historic churches the night before,"" spokesman Judd Deere. ""Protesters were given three warnings by the U.S. Park Police."" In a morning tweet less than two hours before his visit to the shrine,Trump took credit for crackdowns in Washington – and Minneapolis. ""D.C. had no problems last night,"" he said. ""Many arrests. Great job done by all. Overwhelming force. Domination. Likewise, Minneapolis was great (thank you President Trump!)."" A couple hundred peaceful protesters gathered down the street from the national shrine ahead of Trump’s arrival, holding up signs and chanting ""no justice, no peace"" and ""black lives matter."" Police on the scene wore baseball caps and vests, but not riot gear. As Trump's motorcade arrived, some protesters shouted expletives, and others raised their middle finger. Kathy Warner, a 77-year-old retired teacher, said she was there to honor Floyd’s memory and to protest the president. She held a sign that read ""in solidarity – RIP George Floyd – Black Lives Matter.” Warner said she hoped passing drivers would read the message and “think about the injustice done to African Americans for centuries.” Warner said she has a 49-year-old son and that her heart “hurts for moms whose sons can’t reach that age.” She called Trump’s visit to St. John’s on Monday “obscene” for the way he “poses with the Bible.” Some drivers honked in support as they passed by and shook their fists out their car windows. The shrine to the late Pope John Paul II sits on the site of the former John Paul II Cultural Center, which the Knights of Columbus bought in 2011. The lay Catholic organization established it as a shrine to John Paul and added a permanent museum exhibit about his life. Daily masses are held at the shrine, which is a destination for Catholic pilgrims. The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops declared it a national shrine on March 14, 2014, after John Paul was canonized as a saint. ""It is meant to be a place of genuine encounter with God that leads to a renewal of individuals, families, societies, and cultures,"" reads the shrine's official website, adding it is a place where God ""heals and renews every dimension of human life.""

Gregory slammed the presidential visit in a statement shortly before the Trumps' arrival. “I find it baffling that and reprehensible that any Catholic facility would allow itself to be so egregiously misused and manipulated in a fashion that violates our religious principles, which call us to defend the rights of all people even those with whom we might disagree,” Gregory said in a statement. Trump also is scheduled to sign an executive order on international religious freedom on Tuesday. Trump's visit to the shrine comes just one day after he walked across Lafayette Park next to the White House and posed for cameras outside St. John's Episcopal Church, which suffered slight damage after it was set on fire by protesters late Sunday night. Violent protests have erupted in Washington and dozens of other cities across the country following the death of George Floyd, a black man in Minneapolis who died in the custody of police. Former police officer Derrick Chauvin has been charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter in Floyd's death. Critics hammered Trump because police used tear gas and shields on protesters in Lafayette Park, essentially clearing a path for the president to walk to the historic building known as the church of presidents. The show of force came roughly half an hour before a 7 p.m. curfew was to take effect in Washington. ""Tear-gassing peaceful protesters without provocation just so that the President could pose for photos outside a church dishonors every value that faith teaches us,"" said a joint statement from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, said in a speech Tuesday in Philadelphia that the St. John's event proves Trump is ""more interested in serving the passions of his base."" ""When peaceful protesters are dispersed by the order of the president from the doorstep of the people’s house, the White House – using tear gas and flash grenades – in order to stage a photo op at a noble church, we can be forgiven for believing that the president is more interested in power than in principle,"" Biden said. Church officials protested that Trump did not call them about his plans to visit to St. John's on Monday. Mariann E. Budde, bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Washington, which includes St. John’s Episcopal Church, told CNN she was outraged by the use of tear gas to get people out of the way for a photo op. ""The president just used a Bible, the most sacred text of the Judeo-Christian tradition, and one of the churches of my diocese, without permission, as a backdrop for a message antithetical to the teachings of Jesus and everything that our churches stand for,"" she said. Bishop Gregory noted that Saint Pope John Paul II was “an ardent defender of the rights and dignity of human beings"" and ""certainly would not condone the use of tear gas and other deterrents to silence, scatter or intimidate them for a photo opportunity in front of a place of worship and peace."" White House officials said Trump did want to pay his respects to St. John's, which suffered a basement fire during protests Sunday. The president also wanted to leave the White House grounds to prove he was not “in the bunker“ because of the protesters, said one official who requested anonymity to discuss the president’s communications strategy. The president was particularly angry when word got out that the Secret Service escorted him to the bunker of the White House during protests just beyond the gates of the executive mansion on Friday, the official said. After the St. John's visit, the White House put out a statement saying protesters had been repeatedly warned to exit the park ahead of the 7 p.m. curfew. “The perimeter was expanded to help enforce the 7 p.m.curfew in the same area where rioters attempted to burn down one of our nation’s most historic churches the night before,"" spokesman Judd Deere. ""Protesters were given three warnings by the U.S. Park Police."" In a morning tweet less than two hours before his visit to the shrine,Trump took credit for crackdowns in Washington – and Minneapolis. ""D.C. had no problems last night,"" he said. ""Many arrests. Great job done by all. Overwhelming force. Domination. Likewise, Minneapolis was great (thank you President Trump!)."" A couple hundred peaceful protesters gathered down the street from the national shrine ahead of Trump’s arrival, holding up signs and chanting ""no justice, no peace"" and ""black lives matter."" Police on the scene wore baseball caps and vests, but not riot gear. As Trump's motorcade arrived, some protesters shouted expletives, and others raised their middle finger. Kathy Warner, a 77-year-old retired teacher, said she was there to honor Floyd’s memory and to protest the president. She held a sign that read ""in solidarity – RIP George Floyd – Black Lives Matter.” Warner said she hoped passing drivers would read the message and “think about the injustice done to African Americans for centuries.” Warner said she has a 49-year-old son and that her heart “hurts for moms whose sons can’t reach that age.” She called Trump’s visit to St. John’s on Monday “obscene” for the way he “poses with the Bible.” Some drivers honked in support as they passed by and shook their fists out their car windows. The shrine to the late Pope John Paul II sits on the site of the former John Paul II Cultural Center, which the Knights of Columbus bought in 2011. The lay Catholic organization established it as a shrine to John Paul and added a permanent museum exhibit about his life. Daily masses are held at the shrine, which is a destination for Catholic pilgrims. The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops declared it a national shrine on March 14, 2014, after John Paul was canonized as a saint. ""It is meant to be a place of genuine encounter with God that leads to a renewal of individuals, families, societies, and cultures,"" reads the shrine's official website, adding it is a place where God ""heals and renews every dimension of human life.""

Every one of them has told me that a police officer who rats out a bad police officer will be unmercifully abused by fellow police officers … until the good cop leaves the force. That’s the root problem. That “blue line” that everyone talks about is the root cause of the problem. When these events occur, the police officers involved have a long history of complaints. However, they continue to stay on the force, even get promoted. This is not just about race. Look at the Philadelphia Police Department, which has a long history of female officers being harassed. However, the female police officers’ complaints were ignored, and often, the harassing police officers continue to receive promotions rather than disciplinary action. Now, due to the scandal, two police chiefs have been fired and there are pending lawsuits that the city of Philadelphia will lose. Until every city/town official, every police chief, every police officer, and the FOP removes the cone of silence that police officers have for other police officers, this problem will persist. — Robert Hicks, Newark Trump's lack of leadership stuns Meaningful protests are sadly being upstaged by violent rioters. The simple-minded solution to this problem, being proposed by this president, is more violence. There isn’t a wedge issue off-limits to this man, who will stop at nothing to keep presidential power. He played to his base with a tweet about releasing dogs and weapons of war on protesters. This has reminded those who were alive for the Civil Rights era of the worst abuses from those in charge on people who were only asking for fair treatment. The president denies that it was his intent to inflame the worst elements of our society. I no longer believe him; it has happened too often. President Donald Trump departs the White House, Saturday, May 30, 2020, in Washington, before boarding Marine One for a short trip to Andrews Air Force Base, Md. (Photo: Patrick Semansky, AP) This president is incapable or unwilling to quell the present unrest. He seems to have no empathy for those in pain physically or emotionally. He is not going to listen to reasonable protest. The civil rights protests of the 1960s were like surgery, painful but necessary. This time is just as painful, but not necessary. — William J. Denning, Lewes On the Christina schools Regarding the letter on the Christina School District referendum: The seniors and others do not think a tax hike is necessary should be heard. The Philadelphia School District has more students than all of the New Castle County school districts, yet it has one superintendent. Why are our school district top-heavy with so many superintendents for the schools, transportation, discipline, food service, etc.? Maybe they can consolidate some of the duties of the superintendents and cut back on those high salaries. Maybe it is time to have one school district in New Castle County instead of the many we have today. I'm sure when they decided to have one County police force there was opposition to that, but it turned out for the best. New school taxes do not make sense at this time. — Andrea Kauffman, New Castle Read or Share this story: https://www.delawareonline.com/story/opinion/readers/2020/06/02/letters-protestors-trump-and-christina-school-referendum/3124193001/",0.0

The incident was unrelated to protests that occurred in the town earlier in the day. Delaware News Journal After breaking a glass door at Forever 21, looters in Dover Sunday night entered or tried to enter several stores in the Dover Mall, stealing a large amount of clothing, shoes and other items, Dover Police said in a press release Tuesday. The release provided some details regarding how Sunday's events unfolded and the police force's response. The agency's public information officer Master Cpl. Mark Hoffman also announced an arrest made Monday related to the looting. The Dover Post previously reported that police arrested two people Sunday night for throwing rocks at a police car and stealing from Home Depot.

(Photo: Gary Emeigh, Special to The News Journal) PREVIOUS COVERAGE: Dover issues curfew after looting at Dover Mall, Biden to meet Wilmington leaders on Monday Dover is under a curfew from 9 p.m. to 6 a.m. every day indefinitely. In a statement released Monday, the city said the curfew is ""a tool to address the kind of behavior that causes fires, property damage and personal injury."" The looting occurred after a day of protests in response to the death of George Floyd, a 46-year-old black man who died at the hands of a white Minneapolis police officer, Derek Chauvin. A large group started the protests at Legislative Hall around noon. With phrases like, ""Where are the good cops?"" and ""Black Lives Matter,"" they called for an end to racial injustices in their community and across the country. After a group of peaceful protesters started to disperse in the early evening, some made their way to the downtown area and eventually shut down Route 13. At a press conference Monday, Dover Mayor Robin Christiansen said many of the demonstrators later in the day were not involved in the initial peaceful protests. DeAndre Valentine, a self-proclaimed organizer of the protests, told WDEL that he called off the protests around 3 p.m., after about three hours. He said he returned to try to break up the crowds after hearing about the growing unrest. MOTIVATION: Why weekend protests turned violent, and will it change anything? According to the Tuesday press release, a large group arrived at the Dover Mall at about 7:30 p.m. Looters entered the mall by breaking a glass door at Forever 21 and several people ran out with items from the store. Others entered the mall. The security gates and doors at T-Mobile and Foot Locker were damaged but looters did not get in, police said. A large amount of clothing and shoes were stolen from Villa Shoe Store, police said. Hoffman told the Dover Post that police brought the crowd at the Dover Mall under control ""relatively quickly."" The protests then moved back to the highway and looters damaged a few businesses in the area. Officers saw Corey Barlow, a 40-year-old Dover resident, in the downtown area shortly after midnight with two boxes of sneakers and a coat with the tags still on it. Police obtained his information as part of an investigation. At 11 a.m. Monday, Barlow entered Villa Shoe Store through the damaged security gate and police arrested him for trying to steal more merchandise, police said. According to its website, the mall will be open from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. this week and from 12 p.m. to 6 p.m. on Sunday. Not every store will be open. CARNEY RESPONSE: Carney reacts to Trump calling governors 'weak' for response to protests The curfew applies to the entire city, but there are some exceptions. People are allowed to travel to and from work during curfew hours and seek medical care. They can leave home if the situation is unsafe. The curfew does not apply to law enforcement, firefighters, medical personnel or media.

A peaceful protest over the killing of George Floyd and other Black people at the hands of law enforcement began around 3 p.m. at city police headquarters. Organized by the Philadelphia chapter of the political group “Party for Socialism and Liberation,” it moved through Chinatown to the Benjamin Franklin Parkway. Around 5 p.m., some of the estimated 3,000 to 5,000 protesters poured down embankment onto I-676, halting traffic in both directions. The demonstration ended a few minutes later with Philadelphia police using tear gas canisters and pepper spray to disperse the crowd, according to videos that spread quickly online. Viewers around the world expressed shock and outrage at the sight of demonstrators struggling to escape a fenced portion of the highway trench as officers continued to gas the area. They just got us all pretty good. The parkway is a mess right now. pic.twitter.com/RAO049eM82 — Jeff Neiburg (@Jeff_Neiburg) June 1, 2020 In a joint statement issued by Mayor Jim Kenney’s office shortly before midnight Monday, Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw said law enforcement on site had no choice. Outlaw said an unnamed incident commander on the ground ordered tear gas delivered because a Pennsylvania state trooper was trapped in his patrol vehicle on the highway and surrounded by protesters, some of whom allegedly pelted law enforcement with rocks from an overpass. “While on the roadway, the crowd surrounded a state trooper, who was alone and seated in his vehicle, and began rocking the vehicle, with the trooper having no safe means of egress,” she said in a prepared statement. “The SWAT officers gave numerous orders for the crowd to disperse, to which the crowd did not comply.” Mayor Kenney and Outlaw cosigned the use of tear gas while raising questions about a separate incident in which a SWAT trooper was seen pepper-spraying kneeling protesters in the face. Both said the entire encounter would be fully investigated. But neither Kenney’s office nor Outlaw could immediately produce evidence showing any hostile actions had actually occurred. “We’re still gathering information,” Outlaw said at a Tuesday press conference. Many protesters who were there, like 31-year-old Fishtown resident Kara Khan, disputed the city’s version of events. “It’s appalling,” Khan said of the mayor’s office statement. “I have not seen any evidence that is true. It’s really shocking and hurtful watching the mayor lie.” Aerial footage does show some protesters moving past a lone Pennsylvania State Police vehicle in a gridlocked eastbound traffic lane –– but does not show individuals tampering with the vehicle. Later, a state trooper is visible outside the vehicle armed with a long gun, with Philly SWAT officers already approaching the protesters, some of whom had already begun to scatter. In one video, individuals are visible kneeling before an unidentified trooper. “No one seemed distressed. They just seemed like tough guys,” Khan said of the law enforcement present. “I didn’t see anyone throwing rocks at anybody.” Not long afterward, the crowd surged again, and SWAT teams began firing pepper pellets, with tear gas canisters following. Panicked protesters struggled to climb up the embankments, abandoning bicycles and backpacks to escape the gas. Some were trapped in the highway trench, unable to get over the fence before the gas hit them. Others in the back who couldn’t see police shooting tear gas said they thought protesters were running to escape oncoming cars—a similar event occurred on a Minneapolis highway taken over by protesters a few days ago. At the Tuesday press conference, Kenney said his office stood by their initial description of what transpired. “We stand by that statement about a state trooper being surrounded in his vehicles,” he said. In his initial statement supporting the use of teargas, Kenney indicated he had been “disturbed” by the footage he had seen of the protest. But Mike Dunn, a spokesperson for the mayor, later clarified the mayor had not actually seen footage of protesters rocking the vehicle or throwing projectiles. “The Mayor, in using the term ‘footage,’ was referring to video publicly broadcast by news organizations and on social media,” Dunn said. “The Mayor never said he saw the vehicle being rocked back and forth; that specific moment was referenced by the Commissioner. He said he saw footage of the incident that was disturbing.” Dunn could not confirm that the state police vehicle visible in aerial videos was the one in question –– or even where the vehicle in question was located. A state trooper spokesperson said the agency could also not immediately verify the specific details from Outlaw’s statement. A statement from the state police about the incident does not reference protesters throwing rocks or tampering with a trooper’s vehicle. “Law enforcement encountered a very difficult situation in a roadway that could have resulted in harm to protesters or motorists, and we, collectively, took steps to mitigate the risk to everyone on the road,” said spokesperson Ryan Tarkowski.",0.0

1623615305,2020-06-02 13:01:07,Washington archbishop denounces Trump visit to Catholic shrine as 'baffling' and 'reprehensible',https://www.hockessincommunitynews.com/zz/news/20200602/washington-archbishop-denounces-trump-visit-to-catholic-shrine-as-baffling-and-reprehensible?rssfeed=true,en,False,,348142,hockessincommunitynews.com,http://hockessincommunitynews.com/,"WASHINGTON – A day after a much-criticized photo op at a fire-damaged church near the White House, President Donald Trump took his anti-protester ""law and order"" message to a Catholic shrine, a visit that drew swift condemnation from a top church official. Trump and First Lady Melania Trump traveled across town Tuesday for a brief visit to Saint John Paul II National Shrine adjacent to The Catholic University of America. The shrine is a place of prayer for Catholics but welcomes people of all faiths. The Trumps posed for photos in front of a statue of Saint Pope John Paul II outside the shrine and stood silently for a few minutes, hands clasped in front of them. They did not make remarks. Washington Archbishop Wilton D. Gregory slammed the presidential visit in a statement shortly before the Trumps' arrival. “I find it baffling that and reprehensible that any Catholic facility would allow itself to be so egregiously misused and manipulated in a fashion that violates our religious principles, which call us to defend the rights of all people even those with whom we might disagree,” Gregory said in a statement. Trump also is scheduled to sign an executive order on international religious freedom on Tuesday. Trump's visit to the shrine comes just one day after he walked across Lafayette Park next to the White House and posed for cameras outside St. John's Episcopal Church, which suffered slight damage after it was set on fire by protesters late Sunday night. Violent protests have erupted in Washington and dozens of other cities across the country following the death of George Floyd, a black man in Minneapolis who died in the custody of police. Former police officer Derrick Chauvin has been charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter in Floyd's death. Critics hammered Trump because police used tear gas and shields on protesters in Lafayette Park, essentially clearing a path for the president to walk to the historic building known as the church of presidents. The show of force came roughly half an hour before a 7 p.m. curfew was to take effect in Washington. ""Tear-gassing peaceful protesters without provocation just so that the President could pose for photos outside a church dishonors every value that faith teaches us,"" said a joint statement from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, said in a speech Tuesday in Philadelphia that the St. John's event proves Trump is ""more interested in serving the passions of his base."" ""When peaceful protesters are dispersed by the order of the president from the doorstep of the people’s house, the White House – using tear gas and flash grenades – in order to stage a photo op at a noble church, we can be forgiven for believing that the president is more interested in power than in principle,"" Biden said. Church officials protested that Trump did not call them about his plans to visit to St. John's on Monday. Mariann E. Budde, bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Washington, which includes St. John’s Episcopal Church, told CNN she was outraged by the use of tear gas to get people out of the way for a photo op. ""The president just used a Bible, the most sacred text of the Judeo-Christian tradition, and one of the churches of my diocese, without permission, as a backdrop for a message antithetical to the teachings of Jesus and everything that our churches stand for,"" she said. Bishop Gregory noted that Saint Pope John Paul II was “an ardent defender of the rights and dignity of human beings"" and ""certainly would not condone the use of tear gas and other deterrents to silence, scatter or intimidate them for a photo opportunity in front of a place of worship and peace."" White House officials said Trump did want to pay his respects to St. John's, which suffered a basement fire during protests Sunday. The president also wanted to leave the White House grounds to prove he was not “in the bunker“ because of the protesters, said one official who requested anonymity to discuss the president’s communications strategy. The president was particularly angry when word got out that the Secret Service escorted him to the bunker of the White House during protests just beyond the gates of the executive mansion on Friday, the official said. After the St. John's visit, the White House put out a statement saying protesters had been repeatedly warned to exit the park ahead of the 7 p.m. curfew. “The perimeter was expanded to help enforce the 7 p.m.curfew in the same area where rioters attempted to burn down one of our nation’s most historic churches the night before,"" spokesman Judd Deere. ""Protesters were given three warnings by the U.S. Park Police."" In a morning tweet less than two hours before his visit to the shrine,Trump took credit for crackdowns in Washington – and Minneapolis. ""D.C. had no problems last night,"" he said. ""Many arrests. Great job done by all. Overwhelming force. Domination. Likewise, Minneapolis was great (thank you President Trump!)."" A couple hundred peaceful protesters gathered down the street from the national shrine ahead of Trump’s arrival, holding up signs and chanting ""no justice, no peace"" and ""black lives matter."" Police on the scene wore baseball caps and vests, but not riot gear. As Trump's motorcade arrived, some protesters shouted expletives, and others raised their middle finger. Kathy Warner, a 77-year-old retired teacher, said she was there to honor Floyd’s memory and to protest the president. She held a sign that read ""in solidarity – RIP George Floyd – Black Lives Matter.” Warner said she hoped passing drivers would read the message and “think about the injustice done to African Americans for centuries.” Warner said she has a 49-year-old son and that her heart “hurts for moms whose sons can’t reach that age.” She called Trump’s visit to St. John’s on Monday “obscene” for the way he “poses with the Bible.” Some drivers honked in support as they passed by and shook their fists out their car windows. The shrine to the late Pope John Paul II sits on the site of the former John Paul II Cultural Center, which the Knights of Columbus bought in 2011. The lay Catholic organization established it as a shrine to John Paul and added a permanent museum exhibit about his life. Daily masses are held at the shrine, which is a destination for Catholic pilgrims. The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops declared it a national shrine on March 14, 2014, after John Paul was canonized as a saint. ""It is meant to be a place of genuine encounter with God that leads to a renewal of individuals, families, societies, and cultures,"" reads the shrine's official website, adding it is a place where God ""heals and renews every dimension of human life.""

In a video apparently recorded in a police transport vehicle while still at the Merle Hay Mall and then posted on Twitter, Sahouri said police sprayed her in the face with pepper spray after she identified herself as a member of the media. ""I'm press. I'm press. I'm press,"" she said she told police. KCCI earlier showed Sahouri sitting on a curb with her hands zip tied behind her back. It appeared she was wailing in pain from the pepper spray. Another reporter who was with her at the event was not arrested but shared the same account with editors before Sahouri posted her video on Twitter. Sahouri was released hours later and charged with failure to disperse and interference with official acts.

Trump and First Lady Melania Trump traveled across town Tuesday for a brief visit to Saint John Paul II National Shrine adjacent to The Catholic University of America. The shrine is a place of prayer for Catholics but welcomes people of all faiths. The Trumps posed for photos in front of a statue of Saint Pope John Paul II outside the shrine and stood silently for a few minutes, hands clasped in front of them. They did not make remarks. Washington Archbishop Wilton D. Gregory slammed the presidential visit in a statement shortly before the Trumps' arrival. “I find it baffling that and reprehensible that any Catholic facility would allow itself to be so egregiously misused and manipulated in a fashion that violates our religious principles, which call us to defend the rights of all people even those with whom we might disagree,” Gregory said in a statement. Trump also is scheduled to sign an executive order on international religious freedom on Tuesday. Trump's visit to the shrine comes just one day after he walked across Lafayette Park next to the White House and posed for cameras outside St. John's Episcopal Church, which suffered slight damage after it was set on fire by protesters late Sunday night. Violent protests have erupted in Washington and dozens of other cities across the country following the death of George Floyd, a black man in Minneapolis who died in the custody of police. Former police officer Derrick Chauvin has been charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter in Floyd's death. Critics hammered Trump because police used tear gas and shields on protesters in Lafayette Park, essentially clearing a path for the president to walk to the historic building known as the church of presidents. The show of force came roughly half an hour before a 7 p.m. curfew was to take effect in Washington. ""Tear-gassing peaceful protesters without provocation just so that the President could pose for photos outside a church dishonors every value that faith teaches us,"" said a joint statement from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, said in a speech Tuesday in Philadelphia that the St. John's event proves Trump is ""more interested in serving the passions of his base."" ""When peaceful protesters are dispersed by the order of the president from the doorstep of the people’s house, the White House – using tear gas and flash grenades – in order to stage a photo op at a noble church, we can be forgiven for believing that the president is more interested in power than in principle,"" Biden said. Church officials protested that Trump did not call them about his plans to visit to St. John's on Monday. Mariann E. Budde, bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Washington, which includes St. John’s Episcopal Church, told CNN she was outraged by the use of tear gas to get people out of the way for a photo op. ""The president just used a Bible, the most sacred text of the Judeo-Christian tradition, and one of the churches of my diocese, without permission, as a backdrop for a message antithetical to the teachings of Jesus and everything that our churches stand for,"" she said. Bishop Gregory noted that Saint Pope John Paul II was “an ardent defender of the rights and dignity of human beings"" and ""certainly would not condone the use of tear gas and other deterrents to silence, scatter or intimidate them for a photo opportunity in front of a place of worship and peace."" White House officials said Trump did want to pay his respects to St. John's, which suffered a basement fire during protests Sunday. The president also wanted to leave the White House grounds to prove he was not “in the bunker“ because of the protesters, said one official who requested anonymity to discuss the president’s communications strategy. The president was particularly angry when word got out that the Secret Service escorted him to the bunker of the White House during protests just beyond the gates of the executive mansion on Friday, the official said. After the St. John's visit, the White House put out a statement saying protesters had been repeatedly warned to exit the park ahead of the 7 p.m. curfew. “The perimeter was expanded to help enforce the 7 p.m.curfew in the same area where rioters attempted to burn down one of our nation’s most historic churches the night before,"" spokesman Judd Deere. ""Protesters were given three warnings by the U.S. Park Police."" In a morning tweet less than two hours before his visit to the shrine,Trump took credit for crackdowns in Washington – and Minneapolis. ""D.C. had no problems last night,"" he said. ""Many arrests. Great job done by all. Overwhelming force. Domination. Likewise, Minneapolis was great (thank you President Trump!)."" A couple hundred peaceful protesters gathered down the street from the national shrine ahead of Trump’s arrival, holding up signs and chanting ""no justice, no peace"" and ""black lives matter."" Police on the scene wore baseball caps and vests, but not riot gear. As Trump's motorcade arrived, some protesters shouted expletives, and others raised their middle finger. Kathy Warner, a 77-year-old retired teacher, said she was there to honor Floyd’s memory and to protest the president. She held a sign that read ""in solidarity – RIP George Floyd – Black Lives Matter.” Warner said she hoped passing drivers would read the message and “think about the injustice done to African Americans for centuries.” Warner said she has a 49-year-old son and that her heart “hurts for moms whose sons can’t reach that age.” She called Trump’s visit to St. John’s on Monday “obscene” for the way he “poses with the Bible.” Some drivers honked in support as they passed by and shook their fists out their car windows. The shrine to the late Pope John Paul II sits on the site of the former John Paul II Cultural Center, which the Knights of Columbus bought in 2011. The lay Catholic organization established it as a shrine to John Paul and added a permanent museum exhibit about his life. Daily masses are held at the shrine, which is a destination for Catholic pilgrims. The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops declared it a national shrine on March 14, 2014, after John Paul was canonized as a saint. ""It is meant to be a place of genuine encounter with God that leads to a renewal of individuals, families, societies, and cultures,"" reads the shrine's official website, adding it is a place where God ""heals and renews every dimension of human life.""

John Carney rejected a request to send National Guard troops to Washington, D.C., citing what he viewed as heated rhetoric of President Donald Trump and an ill-defined mission. Carney’s spokesman Jonathan Starkey issued the following: “Governor Carney takes his job as commander-in-chief of the Delaware National Guard extremely seriously, and always seriously considers requests for Guard assistance from other jurisdictions. In the last several years, Delaware National Guardsmen and women have assisted the people of Texas, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico in coping with natural disasters. Members of the Delaware Guard also continue to serve overseas to keep us safe. Yesterday, we received a request for Guard assistance in Washington, from the federal government. The mission of our Guardsmen and women in Washington was not at all clear. Sending members out of state also limits the Guard’s ability to manage situations in Delaware – including their current role in our COVID-19 response. And frankly the rhetoric out of the White House seemed like it had the potential to provoke additional unrest. For those reasons, the governor was not comfortable with members of the Delaware Guard assisting in the response. Delaware is not sending members of the Guard to Washington at this time. The governor’s team also has spoken with Mayor Bowser’s office and the mayor’s office has not requested additional assistance.” Trump has called for a hard line in dealing with civil unrest in the nation’s capital, which has been hit with protests and looting. Trump made a controversial decision yesterday to clear the area in front of the White House of protesters with police using tear gas. After that action was taken, Trump walked out of the grounds to the outside of an Episcopal parish and held up a Bible. The action was criticized by former vice president, longtime U.S. Senator and presumptive Democratic nominee for president Joe Biden. He’s using the American military against the American people. He tear-gassed peaceful protesters and fired rubber bullets. For a photo. For our children, for the very soul of our country, we must defeat him. But I mean it when I say this: we can only do it together. https://t.co/G1yE67q9Nz — Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) June 2, 2020 The action was condemned by the Episcopal bishop for Washington, D.C. and the denomination’s presiding bishop.

A memo obtained by Billy Penn and WHYY shows officers will be required to report all use of force live on their radios, rather than as procedural paperwork after the fact. “Effective immediately, and until notified otherwise, all uses of force must be reported via Police Radio, to ensure we can properly defend our actions when we are ultimately challenged,” Outlaw wrote in the department-wide memorandum. On Monday, officers tear-gassed an otherwise peaceful crowd that had descended into the I-676 interstate during one of the many protests of police violence and racism that have swept the city and nation. Officers discharged canisters at a mass of protesters who were trapped on the highway trench with nowhere to run. In one widely circulated video, an officer can be seen ripping off protesters’ facemasks in order to pepper-spray them at close range. In the memo, Outlaw noted the department hasn’t used “less-than-lethal munitions” in recent history. She also hinted at the recent arrests of several local journalists, instructing rank-and-file police to allow reporters to do their jobs “unless extenuating circumstances exist.” In two separate incidents since Sunday, officers detained WHYY education reporter Avi Wolfman-Arent and Inquirer education reporter Kristen Graham. Both identified themselves as press who were on assignment covering protests. Despite these two reporters’ association with recognizable news outlets, Outlaw noted that in general officers might find it “hard to define the ‘press,’” but instructed police to be “as accommodating as possible…even when we have a curfew.” “If you are uncertain about who is considered to be a member of the press, contact a supervisor for directions,” the top cop wrote. “Please remember, the press are not only entitled to access, they have a right to it.”",0.0

Williams said one of the men threw him off his bike, then kicked and punched him in the face before threatening him with a bat as he and others loomed over him as he lay on the ground, bleeding. Williams said he was attacked after being separated from Khan, who stopped her bike after one of the men tried to hit the couple with full water bottles. This, after they mistakenly thought the group was part of the Justice for George Floyd protests, and raised their fists in solidarity, said Khan. Khan said some of the men also threatened her with baseball bats and hurled insults at her as she moved past them and away from Girard Avenue. She said one man called her a “porno b–ch.” “It sucks not to feel safe in your neighborhood,” said Khan, who has lived in Fishtown for six years. During a news conference on Tuesday, Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw said her department was in no way supportive of the group that gathered outside the 26th Police District the night before. “I didn’t ask them to do that, I don’t welcome that, I don’t invite them to come back, and we don’t need them,” said Outlaw. Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner, who made a career defending protesters before he became the city’s top prosecutor, issued a statement on the incident Tuesday night. “I want to be clear: violence and threats and disorderly acts of hatred will not be tolerated by the Philadelphia District Attorney’s Office,” he said. “People who do it will be prosecuted, as will anyone who helps them cause harm. They are the problem, not the solution; they are the danger, not the peaceful protesters.” The police department is still investigating the gathering, including what happened to WHYY producer Jon Ehrens, who said three or four of the men attacked him on Thompson Street after several police squad cars and a tank arrived at the scene to prod everyone to go home. The men, who also shoved Ehrens’ girlfriend, chased after him when they noticed him recording them with his smartphone, said Ehrens, who was not reporting for the public radio station at the time. An ambulance took Ehrens to the hospital, where he was treated for a broken nose. His left eye is swollen shut. “I didn’t see the police inciting violence, but perhaps they could have done a better job at dispersing the crowd quicker,” said Ehrens. It’s unclear whether members of the group were Fishtown residents or if any of them are affiliated with any particular group. Police can be seen in a video Ehrens posted to Twitter arresting a Black man at one point during the night, but neighbors say officers did not detain any of the white men part of the gathering outside the police district, which they said sends a clear signal about what behavior the department is — and isn’t — willing to tolerate. Asked Tuesday why police didn’t arrest anyone from the group for violating the citywide curfew or for allegedly assaulting Williams, Ehrens and his girlfriend, Outlaw didn’t immediately have an answer. “That’s a very good question, and I’ll have an answer to that, not at this moment, at some point later today as we look more into how that unfolded,” she said. As of Tuesday night, the department still had not recorded any arrests of the men involved, according to Staff Inspector Sekou Kinebrew, a department spokesperson. However, earlier in the day, police arrested dozens of protestors who broke off from a massive demonstration to shut down traffic on I-676. The police department, which claimed they used the tear gas after some of the protesters threw rocks at officers and rocked a police vehicle back and forth with a trooper inside, made the arrests after firing tear tear gas at the protesters blocking the highway. Police continued to use tear gas as some of them struggled to climb a steep, fenced enbankment on the side of the expressway. (The department has since revised its use-of-force guidelines. Officers are now required to report all use of force live on their radios, rather than as procedural paperwork after the fact, according to a memo obtained by WHYY and Billy Penn.) “That was the most upsetting thing,” said Khan, who photographed the protest in Center City. “To watch cops stand up and protect people who are being actually violent towards us for no reason was just like, ‘What world do we live in?’” Kinebrew said the department knows Khan is not the only person who feels the police treated the men in Fishtown differently. “We are aware of that perception, take it seriously and are investigating this matter. [Internal Affairs] has initiated an investigation of the events near the 26th Street District, so it’s too early to provide further comment,” said Kinebrew.",0.0

The crosstown trip was excoriated by several Catholic leaders, including Archbishop Wilton D. Gregory of Washington, who said he found it “baffling and reprehensible that any Catholic facility would allow itself to be so egregiously misused and manipulated in a fashion that violates our religious principles” by allowing the visit. The Trumps’ visit to the shrine in Northeast Washington came on the 41st anniversary of the start of St. John Paul II’s pilgrimage to his native Poland, the first trip by pope during which he repeatedly addressed religious and political freedom. The White House said the president offered no remarks during the visit. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo accompanied the Trumps during the brief stay at the shrine. About 100 people, including children and their parents, had gathered near the shrine and began chanting slogans calling for justice for George Floyd, an unarmed black man who died in police custody in Minneapolis May 25. Archbishop Gregory said Catholic teaching calls the faithful to “defend the rights of all people, even those with whom we might disagree.” The evening before the shrine visit, Trump walked from the White House to St. John Episcopal Church, which was set afire during protests May 31 that called for the nation to address racism and police violence. Authorities fired flash-bang shells, gas and rubber bullets to disperse a crowd that had gathered in Lafayette Square across from the White House so Trump could walk to the church, where he held up a Bible as photographers captured the scene. The crowd was present in the park to protest the death of Floyd and other African American people at the hands of police. Archbishop Gregory questioned the decision to disperse the protesters in such a manner. “St. John Paul II was an ardent defender of the rights and dignity of human beings. His legacy bears vivid witness to that truth. He certainly would not condone the use of tear gas and other deterrents to silence, scatter or intimidate them for a photo opportunity in front of a place of worship and peace.”",0.0

As a leader in the local African American community, I can say that the COVID-19 response by the city’s administration has not earned the appreciation and respect of our community. Failure to correct this unfolding scenario can rapidly dissipate any social capital and goodwill accrued in the last 48 hours. Under the administration of Mayor Kenney, local government has acted with disturbing insolence and nonchalance toward the African American community again and again. I have observed mean-spirited shunning and verbalized disdain for Black religious leaders and a lack of support for African-American-led groups. The Kenney administration has not done enough to ensure voters have access to ballots and the vote; it has withdrawn funding for violence prevention programming we have seen work and now, the wholly inadequate COVID-19 response. All of this indicates to me that, for the Kenney administration, Black lives simply don’t matter. Right now, city leaders must collaborate with African American leaders to stop the dangerous march of COVID-19 — quieter than the unrest surrounding us,. yet so deadly. We must come together around a comprehensive data set, coherent mediation strategy. We need a mutually vetted and trusted provider with a network of service sites in our neighborhoods. Already, the Black Doctors COVID-19 Consortium has mobilized to test nearly 5,000 people in Philadelphia and surrounding communities. The group has worked with multiple faith-inspired, civically motivated and socially committed Black organizations to fund and cooperatively stage testing in the neighborhoods and communities where people of highest risk for COVID-19 live, work and play. The city must now partner with this group to expand these efforts that have already proven to work.",0.0

A Boost Mobile store was completely destroyed overnight. While volunteers cleaned, the owner, who didn’t want to speak on the record, stared at his store in shock. “I want to live in a neighborhood that’s better than this,” said Ruth Elliott, a biochemistry instructor at the University of Pennsylvania that lives across the block. Elliott said she hasn’t been able to process the destruction and violence seen in her neighborhood over the last days. Especially because it affects a community that has already been suffering from both the coronavirus and the opioid epidemic. “In many ways, this is an area of the city that has been ignored and isolated for a long time,” Elliott said. “So in some ways, it feels like more of the same, but worsening.” Half a block away, Rosalind Pichardo and Clayton Ruley, the director of community engagement of the country’s largest syringe exchange, Prevention Point Philadelphia, picked up used syringes and cigarette butts. Pichardo, who founded Operation Save our City — an organization that works with families of homicide victims — after her brother was murdered, said the destruction and violence she’s been seeing in the neighborhood this week doesn’t make sense to her. The protests against police brutality and the death of George Floyd at the hands of police started peacefully, but the violence that came later stunned her. “This is supposed to be in honor of George Floyd. We’re not supposed to be taking any more lives here. This isn’t doing George Floyd any justice, by destroying your own community,” she said. Pichardo believes it was outsiders that started the riots that are hurting an already suffering community. Kensington has the highest drug overdose rate in Philadelphia, and it’s also one of the poorest neighborhoods in the city. During the pandemic, she has been providing free lunch daily to people in the neighborhood — and handing out Narcan, the opioid overdose reversal drug. But the violence has changed it all. Pichardo said the neighborhood’s homeless population are being moved from one place to another and instead of being able to feed people in a safe place, like she used to do, she’s been forced to deliver lunches by car. Businesses in Kensington have also lost stores they worked hard to maintain, while others keep losing jobs. “Everybody is affected by this, you know? People can’t go to the corner store now because they’re afraid,” she said. “You can’t be burning stores down for … in the name of who? I mean, George Floyd’s family didn’t want that and they clearly didn’t want the violence to continue.” Solomon Thomas, a bar and restaurant manager who lives in Kensington, said he went out to clean because he doesn’t want to see trash and debris on the street for days. “I want to be able to heal after it’s over,” he said. “As a Black man, I deal with stress daily, but it doesn’t mean that I can’t act. So here I am, doing my little part.” Violence is not what it’s all about Maria Gonzalez, president of HACE, spent all of Monday on Kensington’s commercial corridors, at Front and Allegheny streets, 5th Street and Lehigh Avenue, and Kensington Avenue. She says watching pharmacies and retail stores destroyed was stressful and disappointing. “In a community that is predominantly Hispanic and very low income. It is distressing to see that level of violence and destruction when we know how long it takes for us to be able to rebuild our communities,” Gonzalez said. “We suffer through years of disinvestment, decades of disinvestment, and it’s taking it decades to rebuild back. And to see it gone within a few moments, it is sad.” Gonzalez especially worries about small businesses — ones that are owned by people from the neighborhood. Most of them, she said, were already struggling not to lose their stores after the pandemic forced them to close their doors. “And the little they had, the inventory that they had, was now stolen. So many of them may not be able to open up again,” she said.",0.0

Rizzo, who rose to power in the late 1960s, when Philadelphia was becoming an increasingly segregated city, was sued by the U.S. Justice Department in 1979 for “condoning systematic police brutality,” The Washington Post reported at the time. “I remember what it was like then,” Kenney said of Rizzo era. “And in some ways it never changes.” Speaking to the protests against police brutality Philadelphia has seen daily since Saturday, the mayor said the recent demonstrations have “shown us the anger and distress that people of color have in this country,” pledging to work with the state Legislature and police union to reform the criminal justice system. Deandra Jefferson, with Philly for REAL Justice, has been fighting to remove the statue since 2017 when her group launched the “Frank Rizzo Down” campaign. Jefferson said placing the statue across the street from City Hall, a building that was supposed to be for everyone in the city, felt contradictory to the controversial history he left behind. “We know about him beating people brutally.

Shortly thereafter, Trump strode through a park cleared of the demonstrators to pose with a Bible in front of St. John’s Church, leading a group of officials that included Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. “Walking like lapdogs behind a five-time draft dodging coward who is more interested in looking like a leader than actually being one,” Sen. Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill., who lost both legs in combat as a military helicopter pilot in Iraq, said of Esper and Milley, “sends a horrifying message to our troops — including our black and brown troops — that our military’s leaders will not protect them from unlawful orders.” In a statement on Twitter, Duckworth added, “We cannot allow any Commander in Chief to put our Armed Forces’ reputation as the last institution Americans can trust and respect at risk by using them unlawfully and putting them in a position of exacerbating the divisions driving our union apart. … Threatening military force and imprisonment against Americans exercising their Constitutional rights is not Presidential, it’s tin-pot dictatorial.” But Trump does appear to have the power unilaterally to dispatch active-duty soldiers to trouble spots in the United States. The 1807 Insurrection Act authorizes a U.S. president to deploy military forces for domestic emergencies. The law was updated in 2006 to include natural disasters and terrorist attacks as grounds for sending federal troops to restore order. While condemning looting and vandalism that rocked Providence, R.I., on Monday evening, U.S. Sen. Jack Reed, a Rhode Island Democrat, called Trump’s threats to use military force against American citizens “irresponsible and destablizing.” “The job of bringing calm will take law enforcement and the community working together,” Reed, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, said in an emailed statement Tuesday. “It will not come from recklessly invoking the Insurrection Act.” The Democratic chairman of the House Armed Services Committee told reporters Tuesday he plans to convene an in-person congressional hearing next week to press the Pentagon’s top two officials on Trump’s possible invocation of the Insurrection Act. “We need to hear from Chairman Milley and Secretary Esper as to exactly how they intend to use the U.S. military trying to deal with this domestic crisis,” U.S. Rep. Adam Smith, D-Wash., said on a video conference call. “If the president is basically threatening to use the U.S. military to go in and enforce the law in U.S. cities, that runs the risk of an extreme escalation in violence and of a hugely disruptive practice.” Asked about Milley wearing camouflage fatigues in public Monday night, Smith said the nation’s highest military officer may have misread the message being sent. “The optics of him being in uniform out there might not have been so bad if we didn’t have the president out there talking about going to war with the country and using the military and using overwhelming force,” Smith said of Milley. In a conference call Monday, Trump told the nation’s governors that Milley was “a fighter, a war hero, a lot of victories and no losses and he hates to see the way it’s being handled in the various states, and I just put him in charge.” Milley, whom Trump said was on the call, said nothing. But a senior Pentagon official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said later that the Insurrection Act had not been invoked by Trump and insisted that Milley’s role and authorities have not changed.",0.0

Mostly peaceful throughout the day, the demonstrators faced police officers, National Guard troops and other forces. President Trump called New York protesters “lowlifes and losers,” in a tweet posted Tuesday. Demonstrators throughout the country showed up, even in smaller towns such as Brattleboro, Vt., and Kingman, Ariz. Here are our updates on what is happening around the country: New York City Protesters gathered at places including the Barclays Center, Times Square and at the NYPD Headquarters Tuesday, and daytime demonstrations were relatively peaceful. Tuesday was the first day for the citywide 8 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew, which will stay in effect until at least Sunday, the mayor announced. Trump called on the city to bring in the National Guard in a tweet. New York City put on an 11:00 P.M. CURFEW last night. No wonder they ripped the place apart. Should be 7:00 P.M. CALL UP THE NATIONAL GUARD. #SAVENYC — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 2, 2020  Mayor Bill de Blasio responded, “Thank God we have not had a loss of life in these last 5 days, but you bring outside armed forces into an equation they are not trained for…that is a dangerous scenario.” Police cars and a helicopter converged on one group of marchers blocking an intersection on the Upper East Side around 9 p.m. Protesters chanted “peaceful protest” and held their arms up as officers dispersed the crowd. Marchers told NPR they joined the rally in part because of the death of George Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis, but also because they’re convinced officers around the country are targeting black men. Many businesses were boarded up to prevent a repeat of Monday night’s looting. One business owner who stood outside his shop told NPR he was grateful for the heavy police presence. In Times Square, medical workers, who New York residents have cheered on throughout the coronavirus pandemic, came out to support demonstrations.

Officers blocked demonstrators from leaving, and protesters chanted “Let us through!” Los Angeles Angry residents called for Los Angeles Police Department Chief Michel Moore to resign following days of unrest over Floyd’s death and multiple complaints of brutality by law enforcement. About 500 participants called to join a police commission meeting, causing connection delays. But after nearly an hour, with technical issues resolved, hundreds more residents were added. Many expressed outrage with Moore and saying the department has met demonstrations with an excessive use of force with rubber bullets, tear gas, flash bangs and batons against peaceful and rioting demonstrators alike. Since Monday, Moore has drawn ire following remarks that protesters are “capitalizing” on the latest bouts of chaos, although he apologized on the Tuesday morning call, explaining he “misspoke.” “We will investigate each complaint, and I promise to hold accountable anyone who violates our policy or commits other misconduct,” Moore said, according to the LA Times. Moore noted there have been 13 officer-involved shootings since the start of the year. He added that more than 2,700 people have been arrested amid the protests — most for “failure to disperse” for curfew. Additionally, he said 27 LAPD personnel have been injured, including one hospitalized for a fractured skull and another for a broken knee. It is unclear how many protesters have been injured. Later in the day, more protesters gathered across the sprawling city, including in Hollywood, where armed National Guard members were stationed. About an hour before the countywide curfew went into effect, a massive column of demonstrators marched to Mayor Eric Garcetti’s home in Hancock Park, a wealthy neighborhood lined with palm trees and mansions. “I hear you that this isn’t just about the criminal justice system. This is also about society and where we put our resources,” Garcetti said in a news conference. “I choose to listen and move forward, and bring this city together to build peace on our streets and in our neighborhoods,” Garcetti said. Garcetti calls for peace, saying “George Floyd died in our America so that we may make sense of our future to make sure that we never see that again.” Watch live: https://t.co/LWywHaWswy — KTLA (@KTLA) June 3, 2020  “George Floyd died in our America so that we may make sense of our future to make sure that we never see that again.” Hours past the curfew, demonstrators continued to flout orders to evacuate the streets. Washington, D.C. Large crowds showed up again a day after federal forces used tear gas and rubber bullets on peaceful demonstrators at Lafayette Square, across from the White House. Protesters on Tuesday, primary voting day in The District, were peaceful. The Washington Post and DCist reported that thousands demonstrated, surpassing Monday’s crowd size. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., also joined demonstrators on Tuesday. National Guard troops, the U.S. Park Police and Department of Homeland Security officers stood inside a 7-foot metal fence that was put up overnight and surrounded the perimeter of Lafayette Square, as protesters clung to the outside. At sunset, hundreds lay on the ground, face down, at the Capitol emulating the position in which Minneapolis police held George Floyd before his death. As it midnight neared, reporters said large crowds were still protesting peacefully, hours past the city’s 7 p.m. curfew. This is a developing story.
