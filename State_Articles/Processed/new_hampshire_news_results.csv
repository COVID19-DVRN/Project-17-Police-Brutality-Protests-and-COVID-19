Brooks has her own hives in Dover, but she also will come and bring hives to farms, to help with their pollination, and to help support the bee population in New Hampshire and in Maine. She understands why bees are important to everyone who likes to eat. Orange Circle Farm in Berwick, located on Blackberry Hill Road, allowed Brooks to place four beehives on the 70-acre property. Jeff Benton and Erin Ehlers, owners of the farm, benefit because the bees will pollinate the plants on the farm. Brooks will maintain the hives, increasing the bee community in southern Maine. “Bees can range about five miles, so they do a lot of work,” said Brooks. “These are honeybees, Italian ones. Bees pollinate the fruits and vegetables we eat. Without them, our agriculture would not be successful. So, local farms with bees are really important to the production of local produce.” Bees are recognized as important on the Seacoast. Durham is a certified bee town and every year; pollinator educator events are held in conjunction with National Pollinator Week (June 22-28). Because of COVID-19, those events are canceled this year, as were any for World Bee Day on May 20, so Brooks said it is important that people keep bees in their thoughts. An environmental engineer, Brooks got interested in, then fascinated by bee colonies and how they work, how efficient they are. “Bees are something we can interact with,” said Brooks. “They and their health are a good indicator of how we are treating the environment.” Bees for a hive are ordered in “packages” of 10,000 bees and one queen. Honeycomb frames are placed in the hive and the bees will build on it. “We are super happy to have her here,” said Benton. “It seems like a pretty good place to have bees.” Benton said he and his wife have had the farm about two years. They bought it as open land and are slowly building a working farm, starting with vegetables and flowers, and hoping to soon add animals. The farm is a CSA, a community supported agriculture site. Brooks said there are about 106 CSA members, and said Ehlers is in the process of certification for the farm. “It’s a little overwhelming,” said Benton. “There is so much we want to do here, and we are not capable of doing it all ourselves. So, reaching out to people like Ellen is a great benefit to the farm and our desire for diversity. There is not a ton of farmland left on the Seacoast so it’s important to us to make this succeed.” People in a community can help support bees, even if they do not have hives. Brooks said they can build a pollinator garden, with flowers to attract bees. “They can leave clover and dandelions on the lawn a little longer,” said Brooks. “Bees love them, and they help them in the hive.” A hive is a self-contained community. Brooks can identify each type of bee and talk about their “job.” “The queen flies out of the hive only once in her lifetime,” said Brooks. “She flies out to breed. She will not breed in the hive in order to keep the bee population diverse. Once she breeds, she never leaves the hive again as bees only live six weeks. She can choose to lay fertilized or unfertilized eggs. The eggs hatch in 21 days.” Opening up a beehive is not nearly as frightening as in the movies. No cloud of bees swarmed out in protest. They were fairly placid, flying lazily about in a very non-aggressive manner. “I have been stung a few times,” said Brooks. “Usually it’s because I inadvertently grab one. They are generally docile.” The honey we all love is the byproduct of the nectar bees collect from flowers. Brooks said the bees dehydrate nectar until only 18% water remains. Then it becomes their primary food source.” Varroa mites are the enemy of bees. Brooks said every hive usually has a few but if the population reaches above 3%, the hive must be treated. She said it is a tricky undertaking, and not always successful. Anyone interested in learning more about bees can email Brooks at blackcatbees@gmail.com.",0.0

Ah, and asked them to come in and conduct a federal investigation, which they have been on the ground there doing that. And so they will be taking, ah, uh, lead in this investigation. Advertisement President Trump says he asked FBI, Justice Dept. to expedite investigation after man died in police custody Mayor: Officer who put knee on man's neck should be charged Share Shares Copy Link Copy President Donald Trump called for justice Wednesday for the death of George Floyd after a police officer put his knee on the man's neck.It happened after a white police officer was seen on video kneeling on the neck of a handcuffed black man during an arrest, even after the man said he couldn't breathe and stopped moving.""At my request, the FBI and the Department of Justice are already well into an investigation as to the very sad and tragic death in Minnesota of George Floyd,"" Trump said on Twitter.""I have asked for this investigation to be expedited and greatly appreciate all of the work done by local law enforcement. My heart goes out to George’s family and friends. Justice will be served!""Meanwhile, the mayor of Minneapolis called Wednesday for criminal charges to be filed.Based on the video, Mayor Jacob Frey said he believes officer Derek Chauvin should be charged in Monday's death of Floyd. Chauvin and three other officers were fired Tuesday. The video recorded by a bystander shows Chauvin with his knee on Floyd's neck for several minutes as Floyd is on the ground with his face against the pavement.“I've wrestled with, more than anything else over the last 36 hours, one fundamental question: Why is the man who killed George Floyd not in jail?” said Frey, who is white.He later added: ""I saw no threat. I saw nothing that would signal that this kind of force was necessary.”But despite the officers' swift dismissals, whether the death will be considered a criminal act or something less, like excessive force, is a more complicated question that will likely take months to investigate.Protesters marched more than 2 miles Tuesday to the police precinct in that part of the city, with some damaging property and skirmishing with officers in riot gear who fired tear gas. The Star Tribune reported more conflict Wednesday night at the same precinct, with some protesters throwing rocks and bottles at police, who responded with rubber bullets and tear gas. The newspaper also reported looting at a Target store across the street from the station.Another demonstration unfolded on the street outside Chauvin's suburban home. An officer told protesters that Chauvin was not there. Red cans of paint were earlier spilled on his driveway, and someone wrote “murderer” in chalk at the end of his driveway. No one answered when an Associated Press reporter knocked on the door.Video: Aerials show protests in Los AngelesMany activists, citizens and celebrities called for criminal charges before Frey did. But Floyd's family and the community may have to wait months, if not years, before investigations are complete.Floyd family attorney Benjamin Crump, a prominent civil rights lawyer, called for peaceful protests.“We cannot sink to the level of our oppressors, and we must not endanger others during this pandemic,” Crump said in a statement. “We will demand and ultimately force lasting change by shining a light on treatment that is horrific and unacceptable and by winning justice.”Police Chief Medaria Arradondo, who rose to the top job after his predecessor was forced out following the 2017 shooting of an unarmed white woman by a black Minneapolis officer, urged protesters to “be respectful.” He said he was working to change the department's culture.“One incident can significantly bring people to doubt that,” he said.The chief defended the department’s use of tear gas to break up Tuesday night’s protests, saying officers used it only after some people broke into a secure area that gave them access to squad cars and weapons. Video: Protester falls off police vehicle (warning: graphic)Bridgett Floyd told NBC's “Today” show that the officers involved in her brother's death should be charged with murder because “that’s exactly what they did.” She said she had not watched the video, but she told ABC's “Good Morning America” that she does not understand ""how someone could possibly let an individual go out like that.""The FBI and state law enforcement were investigating Floyd's death, which immediately drew comparisons to the case of Eric Garner, an unarmed black man who died in 2014 in New York after he was placed in a chokehold by police and pleaded for his life, saying he could not breathe.In the Garner case, local prosecutors, the NYPD’s internal affairs unit and the Justice Department all finished investigations into the case before the officer was ultimately fired. Garner’s family and activists spent years begging for the officer to be removed.The officers in the Minneapolis case have not been publicly identified, though one defense attorney has confirmed he is representing Chauvin. The attorney, Tom Kelly, declined to comment further.The police union asked the public to wait for the investigation to take its course and not to “rush to judgment and immediately condemn our officers.” Messages left with the union after the firings were not returned.During Tuesday's protests, some chanted and carried banners that read, “I can’t breathe” and “Jail killer KKKops.” Some stacked shopping carts to make a barricade at a Target store across the street from the station.News accounts show Chauvin was one of six officers who fired their weapons in the 2006 death of Wayne Reyes, who police said pointed a sawed-off shotgun at officers after stabbing two people. Chauvin also shot and wounded a man in 2008 during a struggle after Chauvin and his partner responded to a reported domestic assault. Police did not immediately respond to a request for Chauvin’s service record.In Minneapolis, kneeling on a suspect’s neck is allowed under the department’s use-of-force policy for officers who have received training in how to compress a neck without applying direct pressure to the airway. It is considered a “non-deadly force option,” according to the department’s policy handbook.Two use-of-force experts told The Associated Press that the officer clearly restrained the man too long, noting that the man was under control and no longer fighting. Andrew Scott, a former Boca Raton, Florida, police chief who now testifies as an expert witness in use-of-force cases, called Floyd’s death “a combination of not being trained properly or disregarding their training.”“He couldn’t move. He was telling them he couldn’t breathe, and they ignored him,” Scott said. “I can’t even describe it. It was difficult to watch.”Police said the man matched the description of a suspect in a forgery case at a grocery store, and that he resisted arrest.The video starts with the man on the ground, and does not show what happened in the moments prior. The unidentified officer is kneeling on his neck, ignoring his pleas. “Please, please, please, I can’t breathe. Please, man,” said Floyd, who has his face against the pavement.Floyd also moans. One of the officers tells him to “relax.” Floyd calls for his mother and says: “My stomach hurts, my neck hurts, everything hurts ... I can’t breathe.” As bystanders shout their concern, one officer says, “He’s talking, so he’s breathing.”The man slowly becomes motionless under the officer’s restraint. The officer does not remove his knee until the man is loaded onto a gurney by paramedics.Several witnesses had gathered on a nearby sidewalk, some recording the scene on their phones. The bystanders become increasingly agitated. One man yells repeatedly. “He’s not responsive right now!” Two witnesses, including one woman who said she was a Minneapolis firefighter, yell at the officers to check the man’s pulse. “Check his pulse right now and tell me what it is!” she said.At one point, an officer says: “Don’t do drugs, guys.” And one man yells, “Don’t do drugs, bro? What is that? What do you think this is?”Floyd had worked security for five years at a restaurant called Conga Latin Bistro and rented a home from the restaurant's owner, Jovanni Thunstrom.He was “a good friend, person and a good tenant,” the restaurateur told the Star Tribune. “He was family. His co-workers and friends loved him.”___Associated Press writers Gretchen Ehlke in Milwaukee and Todd Richmond in Madison, Wisconsin, and Hearst TV contributed to this report.",0.0

It appears Brannon Godfrey got sick of being micromanaged by the Selectboard and subjected to a squeeze play between federal laws and local policy. The so-called “Welcoming Hartford” ordinance is little more than an end run around federal immigration enforcement. It is a prime example of what happens when local officials try to second-guess state and federal policies, and is likely to blow up in the town’s face because of the board majority’s refusal to include a “savings clause.” As a member of the original Hartford Charter Commission, I championed the expansion of the Selectboard from five to seven seats to introduce diversity, which doesn’t seem to have resulted because, in Jim Kenyon’s words, “In recent years the Hartford Selectboard has taken on more of a leftist bent — for the betterment of the town.” (The latter is debatable, especially in light of Dennis Brown’s recent resignation in protest of potential open meeting law violations.) What is not debatable is that an inordinate amount of time and energy has been consumed trying to tie the hands of the town’s police chief and his highly professional force, who have already demonstrated a willingness not to harass undocumented immigrants, and this excursion into defying federal laws has been to the detriment of accomplishing necessary town business. Not only has there been a high-handed approach to informing the media, but it seems to apply to the citizenry also. Alicia Barrows commented that “not everybody has taken the time or had an opportunity to understand” the ordinance’s complexity, and the board “must make sure we are diligent in giving all the correct information.” Excuse me, but the time to clarify such a “complex” ordinance was before it was put before the voters for their consideration. As a Hartford taxpayer, I feel we are owed nothing less than that, especially if the town potentially stands to forfeit future federal grants in economically trying times. WILLIAM A. WITTIK Hartford Jenn Alford-Teaster for NH Senate District 8 I just had the pleasure of seeing Jenn Alford-Teaster present the science behind the COVID-19 pandemic on virtual “Science Cafe New Hampshire.” Alford-Teaster’s background in public health and her discernment about what keeps our communities safe is vital in times like this. It is essential to have leaders with knowledge of crisis management and who promote access to health care in rural communities. So here is some good news: She is running for New Hampshire Senate District 8. Alford-Teaster listens with respect and a “we’re in this together” attitude to the life stories of people in District 8; she is committed to improving lives. Especially when life gets challenging, she seeks out and finds plenty of sparks of hope, energy and love for the state. Knowing that there is a hardworking, smart, unifying and trustworthy leader to vote for in Senate District 8 gives me a spark of hope. Get to know Jenn Alford-Teaster and her solution-focused, everyone-on-board approach to improving the lives of New Hampshire’s citizens and communities. VIVIAN DOLKART Grantham Trump’s mind-boggling response to pandemic On May 20, a White House reporter, after reminding President Donald Trump of some of the brutal statistics surrounding the COVID-19 outbreak in our country, asked him, “What would you have done differently facing this crisis?” The president’s response was, “Well, nothing.” He then went on to describe “how amazingly well” we have done. Many U.S presidents have faced historically momentous and challenging events and have reflected on and learned from them. In addition to his tactics of blame and divisiveness in a time that desperately calls for national unity and healing, Trump stands alone in his monumental ignorance, arrogance and inability to engage in meaningful self-reflection. It boggles the mind. RON EBERHARDT Plainfield",0.0

Like any politician, humans aren't the only ones in the middle of an election cycle. One small town in Vermont appoints a mayor of the four legged variety. Meet Lincoln, a Nubian goat and the first pet mayor of Fair Haven, Vermont, elected to office in 2019. Her campaign caused quite the international stir. I got a phone call from Paris. They wanted to know what was going on. And then this year we made the A rumor times in 2019 the first round of the Pet Mayor race. Just because I think it was the first time this was happening. Word spread, especially in France. They were very interested to know what was happening. What's going on? Why's there go being the mayor? Liz Strep, a a reporter for New Station My NBC five covered the goat mayors rise to political fame and her 2020 bid for re election. But don't worry, Fairhaven isn't actually taking executive orders from a goat. The idea electing an animal mayor really started because the school needed a new playground, their playgrounds. I think 30 years old, it's just really not safe. This slide has a big hole in it, and it's just going down. So as a fund raiser, Teoh get a new playground. They thought of this idea. You know, why don't you let a pet mayor and that will spark donations? That's really their only platform, that these candidates are running forest to raise money. So these animals really aren't making any major decisions in the town. They're really more of a mascot to encourage people to donate money to those students. A new playground Last year's election was pretty small. There were, I believe, three candidates. Lincoln ended up winning. She was a young, spunky little goat, very friendly. So I think that really helped her win that election. Lincoln's first days Mayer was very official, though politicians on four legs do come with their challenges. Last year, Lincoln was attending her swearing in ceremony. She had a little bit of an accident. She lost some for marbles. I guess you could say over things a little bit of a commotion there, but it was very entertained. She made her mark. You could say that wasn't one of her final. She, I guess, had a pretty successful first term, which is why she was seeking re election this year. The pet election turned out to be a huge hit both in and out of Fairhaven. So when the 2020 cycle began, competition was fierce because last year was such a big success. And there was so much publicity about Lincoln becoming the town's first pet mayor. A lot of students in the Fairhaven grade school wanted to nominate their own pets, so we had a bunny, a hamster old horse. I think there were five or six dogs. Five acts. There were 18 candidates. There were three main candidates that stood out to voters. Lincoln, the incumbent goat, Sammy, the police canine. And Murphy, the therapy dog. Lincoln at a very successful first term as mayor being an incumbent. A lot of people knew her name already that she was definitely a front runner. She raised. I think, about 1000 or so dollars for the playground, but the goal is $80,000. They really need to raise a lot more money. Murphy thinks reading is important for kids. He thinks having a safe place to play and be outside and get off their phones. This has important. Murphy, a therapy dog, volunteers at the Bear Even grade school, so students were already very familiar with Murphy and Spur. These owner also had several fund raisers during his campaign, though he raised about $500 before the actual town meeting day vote for the school's playground. We were amazed that we were able to raise that much. And then there, Sammy, but police canine Sammy was actually a rescue dog. All the kids were very from there with her, and they're always I wanted her to come in and pay a visit. Do you get to vote today? Welcome to the election stuff Surveying the voters at the polls. A lot of them were very interested in what the name of the animal waas, but also how cute they were. Why do you want to be the war? Said She's so you want 4 to 9 semi because he's true. Why did you want pizzazz? He's cute, and she likes the log on leashes out polling place on town meeting day. A few of the candidates were outside kind of doing a meet and greet with the kids, though I think that could have swayed some of the undecided voters if they had a good experience. He's feeling great. You got to greet all the kids coming to vote. So it was his day. Well, I think she's hungry. That's about yet She's been nibbling on the building. It's a different sort of a day for Everybody Loves Dogs. And then there's even a greater population of love. Police K Nights, Theo Day after a town meeting day, I was in the classroom with a bunch of eighth graders who are counting ballots, and we were there as the results came in. I won't Lincoln doing because I wanted Lincoln personally because he leaves a lot of money for the playground. Last year, I will say this. Eighth grade class WAAS Chris Stan's Class Kristan is Lincoln's owner, so they were a little biased. They really, really were pretty for Lincoln to win. It's my pleasure to announce the winner of the mayoral race fair in Vermont this year. There are a winner is Murphy the dog with 146 votes. When it was announced over the speaker that Murphy had one, there was a little bit of the side. They were a little disappointed, but it didn't take long for them to start cheering and applauding for Murphy. They were very excited that passing the torch on and it's a new year. I think they're looking forward to seeing what Murphy will do with his mayoral seat. I think Murphy will do a great job with the playground fun, so I really wanted him from that store sampling to win. Yeah, I asked him. He didn't care, but he's a new playground and an excuse to see adorable animals weren't the only benefits to the 2020 pet election. The kids were able to learn valuable lessons about exercising their voting rights. Your vote is your voice in the Democratic process. You have a lifetime of voting ahead of you, and I have to take that chance. Every opportunity you get. At the end of the day, this whole pet mayor raises to raise money for the playground, but also to really introduce kids to the importance of voting and taking election seriously, getting to the voting booth and making your voice heard. That's a right that we all have. You know, where U. S citizens and starting that process really early and getting Kate's excited about this process. That's really built goal of all of this. It doesn't matter who wins the playground, the kids, that's what it's about. They haven't reached their goal yet for the playground, but they're really helping that. Murphy can pulls through and get a lot of donations during his time as mayor. And, of course, we had to know. Will this small Vermont town ever hand over the mayoral office to a human? I don't think that there haven will have a human mayor anytime soon. Because Fairhaven has a human town manager, which is essentially sort of the same thing as a mayor. He makes a lot of the big decisions. He oversees that select board. So I think the town government is free, comfortable with just having a town manager. But I think they also really love having a pet mayor. If you'd like to donate to the Fairhaven Grade School Playground Fund, check out the link to the go Fund me in the description box.

(AP Photo/Jim Mone) Jim Mone MINNEAPOLIS — The mayor of Minneapolis called Wednesday for criminal charges to be filed against the white police officer seen on video kneeling on the neck of a handcuffed black man during an arrest, even after the man said he couldn’t breathe and stopped moving. Based on the video, Mayor Jacob Frey said he believes officer Derek Chauvin should be charged in Monday’s death of George Floyd. Chauvin and three other officers were fired Tuesday. The video recorded by a bystander shows Chauvin with his knee on Floyd’s neck for several minutes as Floyd is on the ground with his face against the pavement. “I’ve wrestled with, more than anything else over the last 36 hours, one fundamental question: Why is the man who killed George Floyd not in jail?” said Frey, who is white. He later added: “I saw no threat. I saw nothing that would signal that this kind of force was necessary.” But despite the officers’ swift dismissals, whether the death will be considered a criminal act or something less, like excessive force, is a more complicated question that will likely take months to investigate. Floyd’s death prompted protests Tuesday, with thousands taking to the streets at the intersection where he died. Many protesters marched more than 2 miles to the police precinct station in that part of the city, with some damaging the building’s windows and squad cars and spraying graffiti. Police in riot gear eventually confronted them with tear gas and projectiles. Tense skirmishes stretched late into the evening. Bridgett Floyd told NBC’s Today show that the officers involved in her brother’s death should be charged with murder because “that’s exactly what they did.” She said she had not watched the video, but she told ABC’s Good Morning America that she does not understand “how someone could possibly let an individual go out like that.” The FBI and state law enforcement were investigating Floyd’s death, which immediately drew comparisons to the case of Eric Garner, an unarmed black man who died in 2014 in New York after he was placed in a chokehold by police and pleaded for his life, saying he could not breathe. In the Garner case, local prosecutors, the NYPD’s internal affairs unit and the Justice Department all finished investigations into the case before the officer was ultimately fired. Garner’s family and activists spent years begging for the officer to be removed. The officers in the Minneapolis case have not been publicly identified, though one defense attorney has confirmed he is representing Chauvin. The attorney, Tom Kelly, declined to comment further. The police union asked the public to let the investigation take its course and not to “rush to judgment and immediately condemn our officers.” Messages left with the union after the firings were not returned. During Tuesday’s protests, some chanted and carried banners that read, “I can’t breathe” and “Jail killer KKKops.” Some stacked shopping carts to make a barricade at a Target store across the street from the station. News accounts show Chauvin was one of six officers who fired their weapons in the 2006 death of Wayne Reyes, who police said pointed a sawed-off shotgun at officers after stabbing two people. Chauvin also shot and wounded a man in 2008 during a struggle after Chauvin and his partner responded to a reported domestic assault. Police did not immediately respond to a request for Chauvin’s service record. In Minneapolis, kneeling on a suspect’s neck is allowed under the department’s use-of-force policy for officers who have received training in how to compress a neck without applying direct pressure to the airway. It is considered a “non-deadly force option,” according to the department’s policy handbook. Two use-of-force experts told The Associated Press that the officer clearly restrained the man too long, noting that the man was under control and no longer fighting. Andrew Scott, a former Boca Raton, Florida, police chief who now testifies as an expert witness in use-of-force cases, called Floyd’s death “a combination of not being trained properly or disregarding their training.” “He couldn’t move. He was telling them he couldn’t breathe, and they ignored him,” Scott said. “I can’t even describe it. It was difficult to watch.” Police said the man matched the description of a suspect in a forgery case at a grocery store, and that he resisted arrest. The video starts with the man on the ground, and does not show what happened in the moments prior. The unidentified officer is kneeling on his neck, ignoring his pleas. “Please, please, please, I can’t breathe. Please, man,” said Floyd, who has his face against the pavement. Floyd also moans. One of the officers tells him to “relax.” Floyd calls for his mother and says: “My stomach hurts, my neck hurts, everything hurts ... I can’t breathe.” As bystanders shout their concern, one officer says, “He’s talking, so he’s breathing.” The man slowly becomes motionless under the officer’s restraint. The officer does not remove his knee until the man is loaded onto a gurney by paramedics. Several witnesses had gathered on a nearby sidewalk, some recording the scene on their phones. The bystanders become increasingly agitated. One man yells repeatedly. “He’s not responsive right now!” Two witnesses, including one woman who said she was a Minneapolis firefighter, yell at the officers to check the man’s pulse. “Check his pulse right now and tell me what it is!” she said. At one point, an officer says: “Don’t do drugs, guys.” And one man yells, “Don’t do drugs, bro? What is that? What do you think this is?” Floyd had worked security for five years at a restaurant called Conga Latin Bistro and rented a home from the restaurant’s owner, Jovanni Thunstrom. He was “a good friend, person and a good tenant,” the restaurateur told the Star Tribune. “He was family. His co-workers and friends loved him.”",0.0

A total of 23 protesters were arrested for a series of offenses including breaches to coronavirus legislation.In New Zealand, thousands gathered across multiple cities for Black Lives Matter demonstrations and vigils for Floyd, including in Auckland, Wellington, and Christchurch.In Berlin, protesters gathered in front of the U.S. embassy on Saturday and Sunday, holding signs that bear slogans of the Black Lives Matter movement like ""I can't breathe"" and ""No justice, no peace.""In Australia, multiple protests are being planned this coming week. One is scheduled in Sydney on Tuesday, one for Brisbane on Saturday, for Melbourne on Saturday, and more. Thousands have marked themselves as attending in each of the protests' Facebook event pages.3:30 a.m. ETSAN FRANCISCO - The state Department of Human Resources sent a directive to close all California state buildings “with offices in downtown city areas” on Monday, a sweeping mandate that covers everything from Department of Motor Vehicles offices to those that license workers and provide health care.“After consultation with the California Highway Patrol and Office of Emergency Services, the decision was made this evening to advise all state departments with offices in downtown city areas to close tomorrow, and to notify staff of the decision,” said Amy Palmer, a spokeswoman for the state Government Operations Agency.The directive was sent Sunday evening and it was left up to officials at individual agencies to determine which buildings should be closed.A state Department of Justice memo sent to employees said the attorney general’s offices in Sacramento, Oakland, San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego would be closed, though employees who can work from home should do so.“Staff assigned to these offices should not report to work for any reason. Staff who are able to telework should continue to do so despite the office closures,” the memo said. 3 a.m. ETPORTLAND —Police in Portland deployed tear gas to disperse a large crowd downtown late Sunday night after authorities said projectiles were thrown at officers.Earlier, police said protesters smashed windows at the federal courthouse, and authorities on loudspeakers declared the gathering a civil disturbance.Thousands of people marched throughout Oregon’s largest city on Sunday, the third day of George Floyd protests in Portland.

Some people could be seen throwing water bottles at police.The officers were stationed above the crowd on the steps of the police station and a raised section of Interstate 35.Unlike Dallas, where police made dozens of arrests to enforce a downtown curfew, Austin doesn’t have a curfew and demonstrators have been roaming downtown from the police station to the state Capitol several blocks away for nearly 10 hours. The crowd has ebbed and flowed from a few thousand to a few hundred.Demonstrators could not get on the Capitol grounds, which were protected by a large police presence.12: 45 a.m. ETDENVER — Police fired tear gas and projectiles at demonstrators defying a Denver curfew Sunday night following a day of peaceful marching and chants of “Don’t shoot” alongside boarded-up businesses that had been vandalized the night before.Dozens of demonstrators, some throwing fireworks, taunted police and pushed dumpsters onto Colfax Avenue, a major artery, in the sporadic confrontations that occurred east of downtown.

One was at St. John’s Episcopal Church, which is located across Lafayette Park from the White House.The church says every president beginning with James Madison, “until the present,” has attended a service at the church, giving it the nickname, “the church of presidents.”The first services at the church were held in 1816, according to its website.10:55 p.m. ETWASHINGTON D.C. — Protesters started fires near the White House as tensions with police mounted during a third straight night of demonstrations held in response to the death of George Floyd at police hands in Minnesota.An hour before the 11 p.m. curfew, police fired a major barrage of tear gas stun grenades into the crowd of more than 1,000 people, largely clearing Lafayette Park across the street from the White House and scattering protesters into the street.Protesters piled up road signs and plastic barriers and lit a raging fire in the middle of H Street. Some pulled an American flag from a nearby building and threw it into the blaze. Others added branches pulled from trees. A cinder block structure, on the north side of the park, that had bathrooms and a maintenance office, was engulfed in flames.Several miles north, a separate protest broke out in Northwest D.C., near the Maryland border.

An Associated Press photographer saw police then begin firing many 40 millimeter canisters of tear gas toward the crowd. People were choking, gasping and some throwing up as they scattered, leaving only a few still in the streets.As police and National Guard troops took up positions with plastic shields on major streets, crowds melted away. WSB-TV showed footage about an hour later of officers taking people who lingered in the streets into custody, using plastic ties to handcuff them on street corners. 10:05 p.m. ETBIRMINGHAM - People have damaged a confederate monument in Birmingham, Alabama.

They chanted for justice in Memphis. They stopped freeway traffic in Los Angeles. The death of George Floyd continued to ripple across the U.S. on Wednesday night as the calls became louder for the arrest of the white police officer who knelt on his neck for several minutes in a horrifying video that spread across social media this week. Meanwhile on Thursday, Ben Crump, attorney for Floyd's family, warned any instigators of violence in the Minneapolis protests: ""We don't need that. We need people focused on getting justice,"" he said. He is calling for an independent autopsy, saying he doesn't trust the city of Minneapolis. ""They offered him no humanity while keeping his knee on his neck. Members of the public were the only ones trying to de-escalate the situation. Not the police,"" Crump told CNN on Thursday. ""Keeping the knee on the neck for over 8 minutes – that is unconscionable."" While hundreds of protesters took to the streets, police chiefs from coast to coast expressed their outrage with Floyd's death. ""Do not defend the undefendable, attempt to justify the unjustifiable or excuse the inexcusable,"" Miami Police Chief Jorge Colina said on Twitter. ""George Floyd should be alive today."" ""The lack of compassion, use of excessive force, or going beyond the scope of the law, doesn't just tarnish our badge – it tears at the very fabric of race relations in this country,"" Los Angeles Police Chief Michel Moore said in a statement posted to Twitter. Minneapolis: Police, protesters clash; looters raid Target, Dollar Tree, other stores Protests in Minneapolis devolved into chaos on Wednesday night. Reports of fires came from around the city and videos of looters inside of stores quickly spread on social media. Several people shared video of people taking products from a local Target. A Cub Foods, a Dollar Tree and an AutoZone store also showed signs of damage and looting, and windows of businesses in nearby strip malls were reported to be smashed out. At least one person was killed. Police spokesman John Elder told USA TODAY that the department was investigating a homicide near the area where a reporter from the Star Tribune newspaper tweeted that a looter had been shot and killed by a pawn shop owner. One person was in custody early Thursday, the Star Tribune reported, but police wouldn't confirm if the victim was a looter. “The facts of what led up to the shooting are still being sorted out. We are truly in the infancy of this investigation,” Elder said. As the protests stretched into the evening, Police Chief Medaria Arradondo urged calm. In an interview with KMSP-TV, he noted the internal investigation as well as the FBI’s investigation of Floyd’s death and said they offer a chance at justice. “Justice historically has never come to fruition through some of the acts we’re seeing tonight, whether it’s the looting, the damage to property or other things,” he said. Memphis: George Floyd's death was 'nail in the unfortunate coffin for America' A silent demonstration to protest the death of Floyd, as well as Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery, turned into verbal confrontations with Memphis police and counter-protesters. The rally began with about 40 people holding signs reading “Black Lives Matter,” “Stop killing black people” and “Silence is violence.” Protesters were largely silent, with occasional chants of “no justice, no peace” and the names of black men and women who had been killed by police officers. Passing drivers — and one ambulance — honked in support and waved or gave thumbs-up. Within an hour, however, the protesters were met by two counter-protesters, who identified themselves as members of the Facebook group Confederate 901. Theryn C. Bond, a prominent local activist and former Memphis City Council candidate, confronted the counter-protesters, who occasionally jeered at the crowd to ""go out for a jog"" — a reference to Aubrey's slaying. ""I was so impressed to see so many white allies,"" Bond said. ""Because sometimes we think, 'Everybody doesn't get it.' And I think with the recent murder of George Floyd by police... I think this was the proverbial nail in the unfortunate coffin for America to really understand what we mean when we say, 'Black Lives Matter.'"" Floyd's death this week is the latest in a string of violence against black people. Taylor was shot and killed in her Kentucky home by officers executing a ""no-knock"" search warrant, while Arbery was shot and killed while jogging after being pursued by two white men who later said they thought he was a burglary suspect. Floyd's death this week is the latest in a string of violence against black people. Taylor was shot and killed in her Kentucky home by officers executing a ""no-knock"" search warrant, while Arbery was shot and killed while jogging after being pursued by two white men who later said they thought he was a burglary suspect. Los Angeles: Protesters block 101 freeway, smash windows of California Highway Patrol cruisers Hundreds of people protesting Floyd's death while in police custody blocked a Los Angeles freeway and shattered windows of California Highway Patrol cruisers in a rally organized by Black Lives Matter. Demonstrators gathered in the late afternoon on downtown streets and, eventually, dozens of them moved onto U.S. 101 despite police efforts to keep them from walking into the lanes. When a CHP patrol car arrived, demonstrators surrounded it. The car's window was smashed and it jerked forward and moved away with several protesters who had jumped onto the hood. Television news footage showed one man finally hopping or jumping from the side of the moving car and then flopping onto the ground.

Reports of fires came from around the city and videos of looters inside of stores quickly spread on social media. Several people shared video of people taking products from a local Target. A Cub Foods, a Dollar Tree and an AutoZone store also showed signs of damage and looting, and windows of businesses in nearby strip malls were reported to be smashed out. At least one person was killed. Police spokesman John Elder told USA TODAY that the department was investigating a homicide near the area where a reporter from the Star Tribune newspaper tweeted that a looter had been shot and killed by a pawn shop owner. One person was in custody early Thursday, the Star Tribune reported, but police wouldn't confirm if the victim was a looter. “The facts of what led up to the shooting are still being sorted out. We are truly in the infancy of this investigation,” Elder said. As the protests stretched into the evening, Police Chief Medaria Arradondo urged calm. In an interview with KMSP-TV, he noted the internal investigation as well as the FBI’s investigation of Floyd’s death and said they offer a chance at justice. “Justice historically has never come to fruition through some of the acts we’re seeing tonight, whether it’s the looting, the damage to property or other things,” he said. Memphis: George Floyd's death was 'nail in the unfortunate coffin for America' A silent demonstration to protest the death of Floyd, as well as Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery, turned into verbal confrontations with Memphis police and counter-protesters. The rally began with about 40 people holding signs reading “Black Lives Matter,” “Stop killing black people” and “Silence is violence.” Protesters were largely silent, with occasional chants of “no justice, no peace” and the names of black men and women who had been killed by police officers. Passing drivers — and one ambulance — honked in support and waved or gave thumbs-up. Within an hour, however, the protesters were met by two counter-protesters, who identified themselves as members of the Facebook group Confederate 901. Theryn C. Bond, a prominent local activist and former Memphis City Council candidate, confronted the counter-protesters, who occasionally jeered at the crowd to ""go out for a jog"" — a reference to Aubrey's slaying. ""I was so impressed to see so many white allies,"" Bond said. ""Because sometimes we think, 'Everybody doesn't get it.' And I think with the recent murder of George Floyd by police... I think this was the proverbial nail in the unfortunate coffin for America to really understand what we mean when we say, 'Black Lives Matter.'"" Floyd's death this week is the latest in a string of violence against black people. Taylor was shot and killed in her Kentucky home by officers executing a ""no-knock"" search warrant, while Arbery was shot and killed while jogging after being pursued by two white men who later said they thought he was a burglary suspect.

Demonstrators gathered in the late afternoon on downtown streets and, eventually, dozens of them moved onto U.S. 101 despite police efforts to keep them from walking into the lanes. When a CHP patrol car arrived, demonstrators surrounded it. The car's window was smashed and it jerked forward and moved away with several protesters who had jumped onto the hood.

(AP Photo/Jim Mone) Jim Mone MINNEAPOLIS — The mayor of Minneapolis called Wednesday for criminal charges to be filed against the white police officer seen on video kneeling on the neck of a handcuffed black man during an arrest, even after the man said he couldn’t breathe and stopped moving. Based on the video, Mayor Jacob Frey said he believes officer Derek Chauvin should be charged in Monday’s death of George Floyd. Chauvin and three other officers were fired Tuesday. The video recorded by a bystander shows Chauvin with his knee on Floyd’s neck for several minutes as Floyd is on the ground with his face against the pavement. “I’ve wrestled with, more than anything else over the last 36 hours, one fundamental question: Why is the man who killed George Floyd not in jail?” said Frey, who is white. He later added: “I saw no threat. I saw nothing that would signal that this kind of force was necessary.” But despite the officers’ swift dismissals, whether the death will be considered a criminal act or something less, like excessive force, is a more complicated question that will likely take months to investigate. Floyd’s death prompted protests Tuesday, with thousands taking to the streets at the intersection where he died. Many protesters marched more than 2 miles to the police precinct station in that part of the city, with some damaging the building’s windows and squad cars and spraying graffiti. Police in riot gear eventually confronted them with tear gas and projectiles. Tense skirmishes stretched late into the evening. Bridgett Floyd told NBC’s Today show that the officers involved in her brother’s death should be charged with murder because “that’s exactly what they did.” She said she had not watched the video, but she told ABC’s Good Morning America that she does not understand “how someone could possibly let an individual go out like that.” The FBI and state law enforcement were investigating Floyd’s death, which immediately drew comparisons to the case of Eric Garner, an unarmed black man who died in 2014 in New York after he was placed in a chokehold by police and pleaded for his life, saying he could not breathe. In the Garner case, local prosecutors, the NYPD’s internal affairs unit and the Justice Department all finished investigations into the case before the officer was ultimately fired. Garner’s family and activists spent years begging for the officer to be removed. The officers in the Minneapolis case have not been publicly identified, though one defense attorney has confirmed he is representing Chauvin. The attorney, Tom Kelly, declined to comment further. The police union asked the public to let the investigation take its course and not to “rush to judgment and immediately condemn our officers.” Messages left with the union after the firings were not returned. During Tuesday’s protests, some chanted and carried banners that read, “I can’t breathe” and “Jail killer KKKops.” Some stacked shopping carts to make a barricade at a Target store across the street from the station. News accounts show Chauvin was one of six officers who fired their weapons in the 2006 death of Wayne Reyes, who police said pointed a sawed-off shotgun at officers after stabbing two people. Chauvin also shot and wounded a man in 2008 during a struggle after Chauvin and his partner responded to a reported domestic assault. Police did not immediately respond to a request for Chauvin’s service record. In Minneapolis, kneeling on a suspect’s neck is allowed under the department’s use-of-force policy for officers who have received training in how to compress a neck without applying direct pressure to the airway. It is considered a “non-deadly force option,” according to the department’s policy handbook. Two use-of-force experts told The Associated Press that the officer clearly restrained the man too long, noting that the man was under control and no longer fighting. Andrew Scott, a former Boca Raton, Florida, police chief who now testifies as an expert witness in use-of-force cases, called Floyd’s death “a combination of not being trained properly or disregarding their training.” “He couldn’t move. He was telling them he couldn’t breathe, and they ignored him,” Scott said. “I can’t even describe it. It was difficult to watch.” Police said the man matched the description of a suspect in a forgery case at a grocery store, and that he resisted arrest. The video starts with the man on the ground, and does not show what happened in the moments prior. The unidentified officer is kneeling on his neck, ignoring his pleas. “Please, please, please, I can’t breathe. Please, man,” said Floyd, who has his face against the pavement. Floyd also moans. One of the officers tells him to “relax.” Floyd calls for his mother and says: “My stomach hurts, my neck hurts, everything hurts ... I can’t breathe.” As bystanders shout their concern, one officer says, “He’s talking, so he’s breathing.” The man slowly becomes motionless under the officer’s restraint. The officer does not remove his knee until the man is loaded onto a gurney by paramedics. Several witnesses had gathered on a nearby sidewalk, some recording the scene on their phones. The bystanders become increasingly agitated. One man yells repeatedly. “He’s not responsive right now!” Two witnesses, including one woman who said she was a Minneapolis firefighter, yell at the officers to check the man’s pulse. “Check his pulse right now and tell me what it is!” she said. At one point, an officer says: “Don’t do drugs, guys.” And one man yells, “Don’t do drugs, bro? What is that? What do you think this is?” Floyd had worked security for five years at a restaurant called Conga Latin Bistro and rented a home from the restaurant’s owner, Jovanni Thunstrom. He was “a good friend, person and a good tenant,” the restaurateur told the Star Tribune. “He was family. His co-workers and friends loved him.”",0.0

The statement said there were “some arrests,” but police didn't provide a number.“No officers discharged their service weapons,” police spokesman Sgt. Lamont Washington wrote in an email to The Associated Press. Washington said that all seven were civilians.The protests stretched for more than six hours, ending in the early hours of Friday as rain poured down.“Understandably, emotions are high,” Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer tweeted just before midnight, sharing a Facebook post asking for peace that he said was written on behalf of Taylor's mother. “As Breonna's mother says let's be peaceful as we work toward truth and justice.”Taylor, a 26-year-old emergency medical tech, was shot eight times on March 13 after Louisville narcotics detectives knocked down the front door. No drugs were found in the home.Attention on Taylor's death has intensified after her family sued the police department earlier this month. The case has attracted national headlines alongside the shooting of Ahmaud Arbery in a Georgia neighborhood in February.Thursday's demonstration came as protesters across the country — from Los Angeles to Memphis, Tennessee, to New York to Minneapolis itself — have demonstrated against the death of a black man, George Floyd, in Minneapolis police custody.Around 12:20 a.m., Fischer tweeted a video that he said was a message from Taylor's family.“Louisville, thank you so much for saying Breonna's name tonight. We are not going to stop until we get justice,” a woman says in the video. “But we should stop tonight before people get hurt. Please go home, be safe and be ready to keep fighting.”Meanwhile, live video from downtown Louisville around 12:30 a.m. showed some protesters behind makeshift wooden barricades, which appeared to be made out of picnic tables spray-painted with the words “You can’t kill us all.” Police in body armor and face shields held batons and lined up around Louisville City Hall. They appeared to fire rubber bullets and deploy tear gas canisters, fogging the air and inducing coughs among the remaining members of the crowd.Chants from protesters early Friday included “No justice, no peace” and “Whose streets? Our streets.”",0.0

That was quite a scene of what you've just endured for the past hour. Can you tell us what happened? Well, we saw a lot of it play out on TV there. There seemed to be a little bit of confusion as to what what was supposed to or what was allowed to happen. Now, well, as we're reporting, we had been in verbal contact. At least it seemed, with some of the police officers saying, All right, where can we be? We have heard we played some of it as they were giving out commands for people to clear the area. And we saw that as protesters completely cleared out. And that, of course, came after there was an hour and 1/2. Or at least where we're standing, where there was no sort of police presence. So as people came down, we saw them walking down the block, and whether repress or not, we wanted to make sure we were out of the way. So you so we basically stepped onto the corner is where we were. And I think the moment before the arrest actually happened was we saw at least 11 protester or Allison, who was not media sort of run past us. And that person was cornered by State Patrol was the main unit that seemed to be there. And after that person was apprehended, they then turned toward us now, and that was the first moment I could say that police had gotten behind us. So in a sense, we were sort of surrounded by state patrolman, and it seemed like Minneapolis police officers as well. But again, it was that moment where all of a sudden someone runs past and there are already on edge based on the absolute destruction that's all around them. And that arrests happened just right in front of the Minneapolis Third Precinct. That, of course, went up in flames last night. Omar, I'm not sure you know this, but our cameras were not only rolling the whole time you were taken into custody, but the cameras continue to roll. Frankly, for the entire ride to the precinct, we could see the picture for the whole time. First of all, let me also say, Omar, what an amazing job you did throughout that your composure and your ability to keep your cool is a testament to your professionalism. Um, which we already knew about by how great of a job you're doing covering the story on the streets there. You and your team did a terrific job. Now what we did not hear, even though we saw the transportation, is from the moment you were lead away until the moment you were just released. So can you please tell us what took place while you were in custody? Well, everyone to their credit, was pretty cordial after that happened. So it seemed I was actually talking to the officer that was leading me away. I was like, And then we're gonna be out here for the next few days. What is the guidance of where we should be? If you don't want us that close, where should we? Because we're under the impression that that was OK. And he said, Look, I don't know, man. I'm just following orders, so I don't know who is potentially giving that order in that particular moment. But as far as the people that were leading me away, they there was no animosity there. They weren't they weren't violent with me. We're having conversation about just how crazy this week has been for every single part of the city. And like I mentioned, a lot of these people are on edge. And as we were walking by, we saw a person on the edge of sort of the perimeter that they had formed. And this wasn't a protester. This was just a a random it seemed citizen, who was saying, Hey, I need to get back into my place over there. And where were you when this neighborhood? Completely about the short. I mean, we saw where they were. They were in the middle of what became a focal point of anger, passion, violence, even at times and there they were forced to retreat. And then this morning, literally within a matter of minutes, we saw all of them swarm back in clearing out these protesters from the city level. That's we saw the fire department and Police Department come in. And then the State Patrol was advancing as we're seeing up that street toward our location. Now, where we were standing basically to my right, was where all the protesters were outside or in front of the the building that was on fire and into our left was where they were advancing. So we were basically just going to try and step back and let them continue to advance down the street. But again, you saw what unfolded there. But as far as what happened in between again, they were They were pretty cordial. Once we're in the trucks as well. They were were downtown. Obviously, this is the Hennepin County Public Safety Building here. They're all pretty pretty good with us. Onda conversation. Well, that's a relief, Omar, because you could not have been more professional. You were doing your job by the book. You presented your credentials. You told them that you were a journalist. You told them that you were within and you told them you were. They were. You were live on the air. I mean, you did them the courtesy of explaining that we were live on the air at that moment. And I'm just wondering, after you and your crew were arrested, at what point did they? I mean, did they ever say sorry, that was a mistake. Or when they released you, Was there an explanation of that? That had all been a big misunderstanding or mistake and you're allowed to report there. That conversation may have happened above some of the people that were with for us. It was literally a situation off. Tell me who you are. Me as far as identification purposes than they left. And they came back and said, You're with CNN, Correct? Yes. And then we explained that to other team members that were with me on three, including the security that we that we had hired for this. And then they left, came back and then let us out of the van, were inside the van, handcuffed the whole time. And then we were sat down, waited for a little bit more, and then from there, that was when they eventually came back with our with our belongings that they confiscated. Over the course of this, they had they unclipped our handcuffs. And then that is when we were let out. And again, it's answer your question. There was no sort of sorry. This is a big misunderstanding, blah, blah, blah, because it seems that conversation may have happened. But it didn't happen with us in particular, but also is the difference of jurisdiction. Just just one more question because it was It was a nerve racking moment for all of us watching. You know, Bakari Sellers just described watching it and saying that it was really emotional and heart pumping for him because he was scared for you and other people watching. Given the backdrop of everything that's happening in Minneapolis, he was scared for you at this moment when you were being taken into custody. You know, I should also let you know that Josh Campbell, who was reporting a block or two away from you, was not taken into custody. He was treated quite politely. Were you scared when this was happening? And do you have any idea why you were arrested and not Josh Kim? Well, there was a moment, I would say, minutes after it happened, where things started to sink in a little bit. I think I don't have to tell you Alison or John that sometimes when you're in this job in these scenarios, there's a lot of adrenaline pumping. You're trying to focus and balance so many different factors. In a case like this, I'm tryingto balance what the actual story is, how the story line is advancing while also trying to be aware of our surroundings, which at times can get dangerous. So there's that mentality, and then the arrest happened. I was still trying to communicate with you all as this was going on, because I was just confused as you. We have been showing our credentials throughout this entire week, and especially in the moments leading up to that. So I couldn't really understand what was going on. But as we were walking away and you're sort of taking in the entire neighborhood that had been completely decimated again from the passion of the protesters and unfortunately, some of the rioting and looting that we had seen. It did cross my mind that what is really happening here, and the one thing that gave me a little bit of comfort was that it happened on live TV. There has been this When you talk within the community about, let's just say what's happened with George Floyd. There's always a discussion that what's happening isn't new. It's being filmed, and that speaks to the power of having something happen on camera because you can have people speak up for you without you saying anything. And that gave me a little bit of comfort knowing that you guys saw what was happening. I was living what was happening, and the country was seeing what was happening unfold in real time, right before their eyes. You don't have to doubt my story. It's not filtered in any sort of way. You saw it for your own eyes, and that gave me a little bit of comfort, but it definitely was nerve racking a certain point.

The FBI has opened an investigation into the shooting death.Hundreds flocked downtown Thursday night, and on Friday, it happened again — people demanding justice in the death of Taylor, as well as two minority men recently killed.Details of the case remained quiet for several weeks, but gained national attention after video of the Ahmaud Arbery shooting death in Georgia was made public. Activists across the country began speaking out about the deaths of unarmed black citizens at the hands of police and/or racist white people.In March, Taylor was shot at least eight times when three officers forcibly entered her apartment to serve a search warrant in a narcotics investigation. The department said the men announced themselves and returned gunfire when Taylor's boyfriend fired at them.But in a wrongful death lawsuit, Taylor's mother says the officers didn't knock at all and should've called off their search because the suspect they sought had already been arrested.Officers didn't find drugs in her apartment when they entered, Taylor's mother said in the lawsuit.In the weeks leading up to Thursday’s violent protest, Taylor’s family called for the LMPD officers involved in the case to be relieved of their duties and charged. Activists held a candlelight vigil, a parade and a wreath-laying ceremony to bring attention to the case. The events were all held peacefully, and Taylor's mother said she would like it to remain that way. Police presence intensified around 9:45 p.m. Friday, as officers in riot gear stood shoulder-to-shoulder moving people down a key street near City Hall, the Courier Journal reported.A police officer was seen on camera during a WAVE-TV broadcast firing what appeared to be pepper bullets directly at the camera crew.“I'm getting shot! I'm getting shot!” WAVE-TV reporter Kaitlin Rust is heard yelling off-camera. She told the indignant anchors int he studio that the crew was behind the line, but police wanted them to move further away.Seven people were shot during Thursday’s rally. Two people wounded in the gunfire underwent surgery, while five were in good condition, Mayor Greg Fischer said. CNN contributed to this report.",0.0

""He was my friend.""""I was looking at the video and I said, 'That can't be Floyd,' but later it just blew out. It was Floyd.

""We prayed over every meal, we prayed if we were having a hard time, we prayed if we were having a good time.""Celebrities express outrage over deathAnger over Floyd's death goes beyond his family and friends. A number of celebrities have reacted to the incident on social media.NBA player LeBron James shared a side-by-side photo on Instagram.

""MCCA commends Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo for ""his swift and decisive action to terminate the employment of the officers involved,"" the statement said.""What occurred in Minneapolis is a sobering reminder of how quickly bad policing can undermine that trust.""The Police Officers Federation of Minneapolis said in a statement the officers were cooperating in the investigation and urged ""now is not the time to rush to (judgment)"" while the officers' actions are examined.",0.0

Tim Walz on Friday acknowledged the ""abject failure"" of the response to this week's violent protests and called for swift justice for police involved in the death of George Floyd, a handcuffed black man who pleaded for air as a white officer knelt on his neck. Walz said the state would take over the response and that it's time to show respect and dignity to those who are suffering. ""Minneapolis and St. Paul are on fire. The fire is still smoldering in our streets. The ashes are symbolic of decades and generations of pain, of anguish unheard,"" Walz said, adding. ""Now generations of pain is manifesting itself in front of the world — and the world is watching."" The governor cited a call he received from a state senator who described her district ""on fire, no police, no firefighters, no social control, constituents locked in houses wondering what they were going to do. That is an abject failure that cannot happen."" His comments came the morning after protesters torched a police station that officers abandoned during a third night of violence. Livestream video showed protesters entering the building, where intentionally set fires activated smoke alarms and sprinklers. President Donald Trump threatened action, tweeting ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts,"" which prompted a warning from Twitter for ""glorifying violence."" The governor faced tough questions after National Guard leader Maj. Gen. Jon Jensen blamed a lack of clarity about the Guard's mission for a slow response. Walz said the state was in a supporting role and that it was up to city leaders to run the situation. Walz said it became apparent as the 3rd Precinct was lost that the state had to step in, which happened at 12:05 a.m. Requests from the cities for resources ""never came,"" he said. ""You will not see that tonight, there will be no lack of leadership,"" Walz said. Dozens of fires were also set in nearby St. Paul, where nearly 200 businesses were damaged or looted. Protests spread across the U.S., fueled by outrage over Floyd's death, and years of violence against African Americans at the hands of police. Demonstrators clashed with officers in New York and blocked traffic in Columbus, Ohio, and Denver. Trump threatened to bring Minneapolis ""under control,"" calling the protesters ""thugs"" and tweeting that ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts."" The tweet drew another warning from Twitter, which said the comment violated the platform's rules, but the company did not remove it. Trump also blasted the ""total lack of leadership"" in Minneapolis. A visibly tired and frustrated Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey made his first public appearance of the night early Friday at City Hall and took responsibility for evacuating the precinct, saying it had become too dangerous for officers. As Frey continued, a reporter cut across loudly with a question: ""What's the plan here?"" ""With regard to?"" Frey responded. Then he added: ""There is a lot of pain and anger right now in our city. I understand that ... What we have seen over the past several hours and past couple of nights here in terms of looting is unacceptable."" He defended the city's lack of engagement with looters — only a handful of arrests across the first two nights of violence — and said, ""We are doing absolutely everything that we can to keep the peace."" He said National Guard members were stationed in locations to help stem looting, including at banks, grocery stores and pharmacies. The Minnesota State Patrol arrested a CNN television crew early Friday as the journalists reported on the unrest. While live on air, CNN reporter Omar Jimenez was handcuffed and led away. A producer and a photojournalist for CNN were also taken away in handcuffs. The Minnesota State Patrol said the journalists were among four people arrested as troopers were ""clearing the streets and restoring order,"" and they were released after being confirmed to be media members. CNN said on Twitter that the arrests were ""a clear violation of their First Amendment rights."" Firefighters worked Friday to contain a number of blazes as National Guard troops blocked access to streets where businesses had been damaged. They marched side by side and block by block as they expanded a perimeter around a heavily damaged area. Protests first erupted Tuesday, a day after Floyd's death in a confrontation with police captured on widely seen citizen video. In the footage, Floyd can be seen pleading as officer Derek Chauvin presses his knee against him. As minutes pass, Floyd slowly stops talking and moving. Minutes after the precinct burned, the Guard tweeted that it had activated more than 500 soldiers across the metro area. By Friday morning, a couple dozen Guard members armed with assault-style rifles blocked a street near a Target store that has sustained heavy damage by looters. The Guard said a ""key objective"" was to make sure firefighters could respond to calls, and said in a follow-up tweet that soldiers would assist the Minneapolis Fire Department. But no move was made to put out the 3rd Precinct fire. Assistant Fire Chief Bryan Tyner said fire crews could not safely respond to blazes at the precinct station and some surrounding buildings. Elsewhere in Minneapolis, thousands of peaceful demonstrators marched through the streets calling for justice. In New York City, protesters defied New York's coronavirus prohibition on public gatherings Thursday, clashing with police, while demonstrators blocked traffic in downtown Denver and downtown Columbus. A day earlier, demonstrators had taken to the streets in Los Angeles and Memphis. About 10 protesters went to a Florida home believed to belong to Chauvin. The Orange County Sheriff's Office tweeted Friday that Chauvin was not at the residence and has no plans to be in the area. In Louisville, Kentucky, police confirmed that at least seven people had been shot Thursday night as protesters demanded justice for Breonna Taylor, a black woman who was fatally shot by police in her home in March. In Mississippi, the mayor of the community of Petal resisted calls to resign following his remarks about Floyd's death. Hal Marx, a Republican, asked on Twitter: ""Why in the world would anyone choose to become a police officer in our society today?"" In a follow-up tweet, he said he ""didn't see anything unreasonable."" The city on Thursday released a transcript of the 911 call that brought police to the grocery store where Floyd was arrested. The caller described someone paying with a counterfeit bill, with workers rushing outside to find the man sitting on a van. The caller described the man as ""awfully drunk"" and said he was ""not in control of himself."" Asked by the 911 operator whether the man was ""under the influence of something,"" the caller said: ""Something like that, yes. He is not acting right."" Police said Floyd matched the caller's description of the suspect. State and federal authorities are investigating Floyd's death. Chauvin, the officer who knelt on Floyd's neck, was fired Tuesday, along with three other officers involved in the arrest. ___ Associated Press writers Steve Karnowski, Jeff Baenen and Doug Glass in Minneapolis, Gretchen Ehlke in Milwaukee, and Aaron Morrison in New York contributed to this report.",0.0

The governor faced tough questions after National Guard leader Maj. Gen. Jon Jensen blamed a lack of clarity about the Guard's mission for a slow response. Walz said the state was in a supporting role and that it was up to city leaders to run the situation. Walz said it became apparent as the 3rd Precinct was lost that the state had to step in, which happened at 12:05 a.m. Requests from the cities for resources ""never came,"" he said. ""You will not see that tonight, there will be no lack of leadership,"" Walz said. Dozens of fires were also set in nearby St. Paul, where nearly 200 businesses were damaged or looted. Protests spread across the U.S., fueled by outrage over Floyd's death, and years of violence against African Americans at the hands of police. Demonstrators clashed with officers in New York and blocked traffic in Columbus, Ohio, and Denver. Trump threatened to bring Minneapolis ""under control,"" calling the protesters ""thugs"" and tweeting that ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts."" The tweet drew another warning from Twitter, which said the comment violated the platform's rules, but the company did not remove it. Trump also blasted the ""total lack of leadership"" in Minneapolis. A visibly tired and frustrated Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey made his first public appearance of the night early Friday at City Hall and took responsibility for evacuating the precinct, saying it had become too dangerous for officers. As Frey continued, a reporter cut across loudly with a question: ""What's the plan here?"" ""With regard to?"" Frey responded. Then he added: ""There is a lot of pain and anger right now in our city. I understand that ... What we have seen over the past several hours and past couple of nights here in terms of looting is unacceptable."" He defended the city's lack of engagement with looters — only a handful of arrests across the first two nights of violence — and said, ""We are doing absolutely everything that we can to keep the peace."" He said National Guard members were stationed in locations to help stem looting, including at banks, grocery stores and pharmacies. The Minnesota State Patrol arrested a CNN television crew early Friday as the journalists reported on the unrest. While live on air, CNN reporter Omar Jimenez was handcuffed and led away. A producer and a photojournalist for CNN were also taken away in handcuffs. The Minnesota State Patrol said the journalists were among four people arrested as troopers were ""clearing the streets and restoring order,"" and they were released after being confirmed to be media members. CNN said on Twitter that the arrests were ""a clear violation of their First Amendment rights."" Firefighters worked Friday to contain a number of blazes as National Guard troops blocked access to streets where businesses had been damaged. They marched side by side and block by block as they expanded a perimeter around a heavily damaged area. Protests first erupted Tuesday, a day after Floyd's death in a confrontation with police captured on widely seen citizen video. In the footage, Floyd can be seen pleading as officer Derek Chauvin presses his knee against him. As minutes pass, Floyd slowly stops talking and moving. Minutes after the precinct burned, the Guard tweeted that it had activated more than 500 soldiers across the metro area. By Friday morning, a couple dozen Guard members armed with assault-style rifles blocked a street near a Target store that has sustained heavy damage by looters. The Guard said a ""key objective"" was to make sure firefighters could respond to calls, and said in a follow-up tweet that soldiers would assist the Minneapolis Fire Department. But no move was made to put out the 3rd Precinct fire. Assistant Fire Chief Bryan Tyner said fire crews could not safely respond to blazes at the precinct station and some surrounding buildings. Elsewhere in Minneapolis, thousands of peaceful demonstrators marched through the streets calling for justice. In New York City, protesters defied New York's coronavirus prohibition on public gatherings Thursday, clashing with police, while demonstrators blocked traffic in downtown Denver and downtown Columbus. A day earlier, demonstrators had taken to the streets in Los Angeles and Memphis. About 10 protesters went to a Florida home believed to belong to Chauvin. The Orange County Sheriff's Office tweeted Friday that Chauvin was not at the residence and has no plans to be in the area. In Louisville, Kentucky, police confirmed that at least seven people had been shot Thursday night as protesters demanded justice for Breonna Taylor, a black woman who was fatally shot by police in her home in March. In Mississippi, the mayor of the community of Petal resisted calls to resign following his remarks about Floyd's death. Hal Marx, a Republican, asked on Twitter: ""Why in the world would anyone choose to become a police officer in our society today?"" In a follow-up tweet, he said he ""didn't see anything unreasonable."" The city on Thursday released a transcript of the 911 call that brought police to the grocery store where Floyd was arrested. The caller described someone paying with a counterfeit bill, with workers rushing outside to find the man sitting on a van. The caller described the man as ""awfully drunk"" and said he was ""not in control of himself."" Asked by the 911 operator whether the man was ""under the influence of something,"" the caller said: ""Something like that, yes. He is not acting right."" Police said Floyd matched the caller's description of the suspect. State and federal authorities are investigating Floyd's death. Chauvin, the officer who knelt on Floyd's neck, was fired Tuesday, along with three other officers involved in the arrest. ___ Associated Press writers Steve Karnowski, Jeff Baenen and Doug Glass in Minneapolis, Gretchen Ehlke in Milwaukee, and Aaron Morrison in New York contributed to this report.",0.0

Over the past few days demonstrations in Minnesota have evolved from peaceful cries for justice into violence and destruction. Floyd's arrest and final minutes of his life were captured in multiple videos that are circulating widely on social media. In all versions, Floyd is pinned to the ground with his hands handcuffed behind his back. The knee of a police officer is crushing his neck, as another officer stands a few feet away. He is watching, seeming unfazed as the 46-year-old cries, ""I can't breathe."" Angry crowds have looted businesses and burned buildings. Meanwhile, law enforcement has met the civil disorder with clouds of tear gas. The unrest prompted Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz to activate the National Guard on Thursday to bring calm to the streets. ""It is how we express pain, process tragedy and create change,"" he said about the act of protesting. But he noted the urgency in responding to local leaders' calls for the National Guard ""to protect peaceful demonstrators, neighbors and small businesses in Minnesota."" ""It is time to rebuild. Rebuild the city, rebuild our justice system and rebuild the relationship between law enforcement and those they're charged to protect,"" Walz added. Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan added that the purpose of the National Guard is to ensure safe demonstrations and to protect small-business owners. ""The anger and grief of this moment is unbearable. People deserve to be seen. People deserve to be heard. People deserve to be safe,"" Flanagan said. ""While many Minnesotans are taking extensive safety precautions while exercising their right to protest, the demonstration last night became incredibly unsafe for all involved,"" she added. In all, four officers were involved in Floyd's death. All have been fired from the Minneapolis Police Department. Several investigations into their actions have been launched, but as of Thursday, no charges have been filed. ",0.0

The disturbing video of Monday night's death — during which a white officer's knee was planted firmly on George Floyd's neck and his desperate calls for help were ignored — has prompted protests in the Minnesota city and demands for charges for the officers involved. At a news conference Wednesday, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey called on Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman to ""act on the evidence before him"" and press charges on the arresting officer. ""Why is the man who killed George Floyd not in jail? If you had done it or I had done it, we would be behind bars right now. And I cannot come up with a good answer to that question,"" Frey told a news conference Wednesday. ""We watched for five whole excruciating minutes as a white officer firmly pressed his knee into the neck of an unarmed, handcuffed black man,"" he added, noting that the arresting officer was not practicing a technique condoned by the city's police. ""I saw no threat; I saw nothing that would signal that this kind of force was necessary."" Frey refrained from specifying what charges he would like to see, citing a desire not to impede investigators. But Floyd's sister Bridgett went one step further on national television earlier Wednesday. ""I would like for those officers to be charged with murder because that's exactly what they did,"" she told the Today show. ""They murdered my brother; he was crying for help."" She said the family, which has retained legal representation, is far from satisfied with the announcement that the four officers in the video have been fired — a swift decision that Frey said was ""the right call."" The Minneapolis Police Department has not publicly confirmed the officers' identities, and it said the FBI is also investigating the circumstances of Floyd's death. The announcement also failed to satisfy protesters who on Tuesday evening thronged to the department's 3rd Precinct, where clashes erupted between demonstrators and law enforcement in riot gear. As Minnesota Public Radio reported, the demonstrators damaged the building and a squad car in a confrontation that eventually saw police firing tear gas into the crowd. ""What we witnessed today was state-sponsored murder, a state-sponsored execution,"" Steven Belton, president of the nonprofit Urban League Twin Cities, said at a gathering of local civil rights leaders earlier Tuesday outside City Hall. ""And what we await to see is whether it's going to become state-sanctioned execution. It'll be sanctioned if nothing is done."" The controversy engulfing Minneapolis is not unfolding in a vacuum. Already a video recorded earlier this year in Georgia — depicting the death of an unarmed black man, who was followed and shot by two white men while out for a jog three months ago — has renewed questions about the conduct of local police, who did not arrest the men until after the video surfaced this month. And this week, a recorded encounter in New York City's Central Park caught fire after it was posted to social media. In the video, a white woman calls the police on a black man, who says he had simply asked her to leash her dog while he was out bird-watching. ""He's recording me and threatening me and my dog,"" she tells emergency operators multiple times as the man recording her keeps his distance. After the video surfaced, the woman was fired by her employer, the investment firm Franklin Templeton. The video recorded in Minneapolis more closely called to mind an earlier death in New York City, however. Like Eric Garner, who died after an officer's chokehold in 2014, Floyd's final words before he appeared to lose consciousness were a plea for help: ""I can't breathe."" Floyd is seen wailing the phrase several times with his face planted on the pavement, his hands apparently cuffed behind his back and a male officer kneeling on his neck. Observers standing nearby are heard telling officers that Floyd's nose was bleeding and that he was dying. The officer and his colleagues show little reaction as the man gradually goes silent. The officer does not lift his weight off Floyd's neck throughout most of the video until medical workers arrive to lift him into an ambulance on a stretcher. The New York City police officer who used the chokehold on Garner, Daniel Pantaleo, was never charged with a crime but was fired last year on a judge's recommendation. The Floyd family's attorney emphasized the link with Garner in comments Wednesday to the Today show. ""It's worse than Eric Garner in many ways,"" civil rights attorney Benjamin Crump said, ""because you hear the people even pleading with them, 'Please get your knee off his neck. Have some humanity; this is a human being,' "" U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota said in a statement Tuesday, ""There must be a complete and thorough outside investigation into what occurred, and those involved in this incident must be held accountable. Justice must be served for this man and his family, justice must be served for our community, and justice must be served for our country."" ",0.0

For a third straight night, the Midwestern city saw clashes between police and protesters after the death of George Floyd, a black man whose arresting officer was recorded kneeling on his neck for minutes on end. The four officers involved have been fired and the incident is under federal investigation, but demonstrators are not satisfied. Some of them stormed the 3rd Police Precinct, setting fire to that building and others in the neighborhood. President Trump, who called Floyd's death ""very sad and tragic"" earlier this week, said early Friday that he had told Minnesota's governor that ""the Military is with him all the way."" He also described the source of the unrest as ""THUGS"" — a word widely criticized for bearing racial overtones. ""Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts,"" he continued, in a tweet flagged by Twitter for violating its policy against glorifying violence. The president's comments came after a night of chaos in the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul, where several fires raged and some businesses were sacked, according to Minnesota Public Radio. Protesters also overran the 3rd Precinct after police withdrew in an attempt to mitigate tensions. ""Brick and mortar is not as important as life,"" Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said, noting that though the building was emptied, patrols would continue in the neighborhood. ""We are doing absolutely everything that we can to keep the peace."" Minneapolis has seethed since the release of the video depicting Floyd's arrest by a white police officer. The officer plants a knee on his neck for at least seven minutes as Floyd cries for help and eventually falls silent and as bystanders shout that he's dying. The officer did not remove his knee until paramedics showed up to move Floyd's unresponsive body into an ambulance. He was reported dead later that night. Since then, Minneapolis has seen a series of escalating protests over his death, while anger has been evident in other cities, as well. Protesters have turned out to express their outrage as far as Los Angeles and New York City. Meanwhile in Louisville, Ky., demonstrators gathered Thursday to protest death of Breonna Taylor, a black woman shot by police in her home in March. As one protester in Minneapolis told NPR, the anger over Floyd's death is about more than just one man — it's about how police treat black people across the U.S. ""This is how our people react, you know? When we've been done wrong for so long,"" he said. ""So, me, I'm just praying and hoping everybody makes it home safe."" On Friday morning, state police arrested a CNN crew while they were reporting about the unrest on live television. ""A black reporter from CNN was arrested while legally covering the protests in Minneapolis,"" the network pointedly noted. ""A white reporter also on the ground was not."" The crew consisting of correspondent Omar Jimenez, producer Bill Kirkos and photojournalist Leonel Mendez was released about an hour later. CNN Worldwide President Jeff Zucker said that Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz personally apologized to him for the incident. The swift backtrack did little to soften the shock of the spectacle, though. ""With all the perversions of American democracy that we have witnessed, few rival the dystopian spectacle of a U.S. journalist calmly reporting the news and repeatedly offering to reposition his crew at the police's request, only to be arrested, cuffed and hauled away alongside his crew,"" said Suzanne Nossel, CEO of PEN America, advocacy group that fights for press freedom. She added: ""For us at PEN America, where we routinely document the arrest and imprisonment of writers and journalists worldwide, the action was eerily familiar, but something we expect to see in authoritarian states: Turkey, Hong Kong, Egypt. To see it in the United States of America is appalling."" NPR's Adrian Florido contributed to this report. ",0.0

The threat came in two tweets from the White House after protests over the death of a handcuffed black man in police custody this week escalated into violence overnight. Trump tweeted as scenes of a police station and other buildings burning in Minneapolis aired on television amid calls for the officer’s arrest. “These THUGS are dishonoring the memory of George Floyd, and I won’t let that happen,” Trump tweeted, referring to the man who died after an officer was shown on video pressing his knee into Floyd’s neck. “Just spoke to Governor Tim Walz and told him that the Military is with him all the way. Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts. Thank you!” The use of the word “thugs” has racist connotations, and Twitter labeled the message as a violation of the messaging service’s rules for “glorifying violence.” It was paired with another presidential tweet in which Trump said that he “can’t stand back & watch this happen to a great American City, Minneapolis.” Trump warned that if the mayor of Minneapolis, Jacob Frey, doesn’t “get his act together and bring the City under control,” he will “send in the National Guard & get the job done right.” The president did not acknowledge that Walz, a Democrat and retired commander in the National Guard, already had activated guardsmen to assist on Thursday. Trump’s reaction immediately pulled the Pentagon deeper into a crisis that already has racial and political dynamics. Trump’s tweets also had parallels to his comments about the southern border in 2018, when he suggested that if migrants threw rocks at U.S. troops dispatched there, American forces should treat the rocks as though they were rifles. After a backlash, Trump said the migrants would not be shot. Walz’s activation of guardsmen to provide support to police in Minnesota follows similar actions by other governors amid unrest prompted by the death of black men at the hands of police, including in Ferguson, Missouri, in 2014, and in Baltimore in 2015. In those cases, the guardsmen operated under state orders and did not participate in law enforcement in accordance with the federal Posse Comitatus Act, which limits the use of the military against American citizens under many circumstances. But Trump could order federal troops to Minnesota under laws, such as the Insurrection Act, which allows presidents to deploy the military domestically during emergencies without the permission of a governor, said Stephen Vladeck, a professor at the University of Texas School of Law. Such actions are rare but have occurred before, most recently in 1992 amid rioting in Los Angeles after the police beating of Rodney King was recorded on video. Then-President George H.W. Bush deployed 4,000 active-duty soldiers and Marines to complement thousands of National Guardsmen and police. A defense official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, said he had seen no indication of imminent steps to federalize the National Guard under Trump’s control. While the president has the authority to take control of guardsmen, that would likely only occur if it was clear that authorities in Minnesota were unable to bring the situation under control, the official said.",0.0

""Please, the knee in my neck, I can’t breathe, sir."" ""He should not have died,"" Minneapolis Mayor Frey said. ""What we saw was horrible, completely and utterly messed up. ...

""When you hear someone calling for help, you are supposed to help. This officer failed in the most basic human sense."" Being black – being a person of color – in America shouldn’t be a death sentence – how many times must that sentiment be repeated, how many lives lost to prove the point? Indeed, how many lives may have been lost because there were no witnesses, no bystanders video recording deaths and lynchings. On Wednesday, as headlines lamented that more than 100,000 Americans had died of COVID-19 within approximately 100 days, it was also reported, less breathlessly, that with 20,000 deaths, African Americans are dying of the virus at three times the rate of white people. It was reported that COVID-19 is twice as deadly for black and Latinos than whites in New York City; that African Americans are 70% of all coronavirus cases in Chicago – which is 30% black.

The Navajo Nation has infection rates higher than any state: for example, in New Mexico, where Native Americans are 11% of the population they account for more than 50% of the COVID-19 cases. America’s minority communities and communities of color disproportionately suffer from COVID-19 because they have been oppressed – institutionally, medically, educationally, economically and politically disenfranchised – for generations, oppressed by a structural racism that has left their communities vulnerable and marginalized and less able to cope with the health impacts of a pandemic like COVID-19.

This past week, after Christian Cooper, a 57-year-old black birdwatcher asked a 41-year-old white dog-walker, Amy Cooper (no relation), to leash her dog in the Bramble, an area of New York’s Central Park where leashing is required, the fragile white woman exercising her implicit privilege and power – responded by calling the police saying ""an African American man in Central Park ... is recording me and threatened myself and my dog … Please send a cop! Immediately!"" In Minnesota this past week cops immediately responded to a non-violent allegation of forgery in Minneapolis. As a result, a black man, George Floyd, was killed after Derek Chauvin, a white Minneapolis police officer – in the presence of three other policemen – exercising his privilege and power –b unyieldingly pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck as he, handcuffed and prone on the asphalt, shouted he couldn’t breathe. ""Please, the knee in my neck, I can’t breathe, sir."" ""He should not have died,"" Minneapolis Mayor Frey said. ""What we saw was horrible, completely and utterly messed up. ... Whatever the investigation reveals, it does not change the simple truth that he should be with us this morning."" ""Being black in America should not be a death sentence,"" the mayor continued. ""When you hear someone calling for help, you are supposed to help. This officer failed in the most basic human sense."" Being black – being a person of color – in America shouldn’t be a death sentence – how many times must that sentiment be repeated, how many lives lost to prove the point? Indeed, how many lives may have been lost because there were no witnesses, no bystanders video recording deaths and lynchings. On Wednesday, as headlines lamented that more than 100,000 Americans had died of COVID-19 within approximately 100 days, it was also reported, less breathlessly, that with 20,000 deaths, African Americans are dying of the virus at three times the rate of white people. It was reported that COVID-19 is twice as deadly for black and Latinos than whites in New York City; that African Americans are 70% of all coronavirus cases in Chicago – which is 30% black. ""Please, the knee in my neck, I can’t breathe, sir."" Within America’s native communities the toll has been as deadly. The Navajo Nation has infection rates higher than any state: for example, in New Mexico, where Native Americans are 11% of the population they account for more than 50% of the COVID-19 cases. America’s minority communities and communities of color disproportionately suffer from COVID-19 because they have been oppressed – institutionally, medically, educationally, economically and politically disenfranchised – for generations, oppressed by a structural racism that has left their communities vulnerable and marginalized and less able to cope with the health impacts of a pandemic like COVID-19. ""Please, the knee in my neck, I can’t breathe, sir."" Their oppressors – including those like my critic whom I quote above – refuse to recognize that their privilege has – and continues to – dehumanize others, resulting in a system where black lives matter less than white lives. Their insistence in believing they have rights superior to individuals whom they believe are unworthy, untrustworthy, lazy, and ungrateful for the opportunities patronizingly offered to them by the dominant white class. It is within this racist paradigm that MAGA world thrives, a reality where, as Trump addressed the Veterans of Foreign Wars Convention in 2018: ""Just remember, what you are seeing and what you are reading is not what's happening."" A reality where anything that is not ""Trump’s"" truth is a lie. Trump’s reality – that which offends urban elites, immigrants, media and non-whites – is what mobilizes MAGA. Indeed, the more incompetent, incoherent and unhinged Trump is, the more loyal they are – and the more exploited they are. In the end they, too – unconsciously – are losing their breath, their lives, their jobs. They – unconsciously – within their resentments and grievances, are today betraying their own identities, families, and faiths; today losing their humanity. Sadly, MAGA world cannot see that in the pursuit of securing their dominance as oppressor they are dehumanizing themselves, that as they’re dehumanizing the Other they’re dehumanizing themselves.

The threat came in two tweets from the White House after protests over the death of a handcuffed black man in police custody this week escalated into violence overnight. Trump tweeted as scenes of a police station and other buildings burning in Minneapolis aired on television amid calls for the officer’s arrest. “These THUGS are dishonoring the memory of George Floyd, and I won’t let that happen,” Trump tweeted, referring to the man who died after an officer was shown on video pressing his knee into Floyd’s neck. “Just spoke to Governor Tim Walz and told him that the Military is with him all the way. Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts. Thank you!” The use of the word “thugs” has racist connotations, and Twitter labeled the message as a violation of the messaging service’s rules for “glorifying violence.” It was paired with another presidential tweet in which Trump said that he “can’t stand back & watch this happen to a great American City, Minneapolis.” Trump warned that if the mayor of Minneapolis, Jacob Frey, doesn’t “get his act together and bring the City under control,” he will “send in the National Guard & get the job done right.” The president did not acknowledge that Walz, a Democrat and retired commander in the National Guard, already had activated guardsmen to assist on Thursday. Trump’s reaction immediately pulled the Pentagon deeper into a crisis that already has racial and political dynamics. Trump’s tweets also had parallels to his comments about the southern border in 2018, when he suggested that if migrants threw rocks at U.S. troops dispatched there, American forces should treat the rocks as though they were rifles. After a backlash, Trump said the migrants would not be shot. Walz’s activation of guardsmen to provide support to police in Minnesota follows similar actions by other governors amid unrest prompted by the death of black men at the hands of police, including in Ferguson, Missouri, in 2014, and in Baltimore in 2015. In those cases, the guardsmen operated under state orders and did not participate in law enforcement in accordance with the federal Posse Comitatus Act, which limits the use of the military against American citizens under many circumstances. But Trump could order federal troops to Minnesota under laws, such as the Insurrection Act, which allows presidents to deploy the military domestically during emergencies without the permission of a governor, said Stephen Vladeck, a professor at the University of Texas School of Law. Such actions are rare but have occurred before, most recently in 1992 amid rioting in Los Angeles after the police beating of Rodney King was recorded on video. Then-President George H.W. Bush deployed 4,000 active-duty soldiers and Marines to complement thousands of National Guardsmen and police. A defense official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, said he had seen no indication of imminent steps to federalize the National Guard under Trump’s control. While the president has the authority to take control of guardsmen, that would likely only occur if it was clear that authorities in Minnesota were unable to bring the situation under control, the official said.",0.0

Amy Klobuchar seems a less likely choice to become Joe Biden's running mate on his presidential ticket following this week's death of a black man in police custody in Minneapolis, a key ally of the former vice president said. Rep. James Clyburn, D-S.C., told reporters on Friday that while he believes Klobuchar is 'absolutely' qualified to be vice president, 'This is very tough timing for her.' Klobuchar was a prosecutor years ago in the county that includes Minneapolis. During that period, more than two dozen people "" mostly minorities "" died during encounters with police. Following customary practice at the time, she sent the cases to grand juries, which brought no criminal charges against any of the officers involved. Clyburn, who called his view a 'gut feeling,' played a pivotal role in helping Biden become the Democratic Party's all-but-certain presidential nominee. Clyburn is the No. 3 House Democratic leader and Congress' highest-ranking black lawmaker. 'So often in politics, timing really dictates things. Barack Obama I don't think could have gotten elected four years before he got elected,"" Clyburn said of the former president during a conference call. 'And I don't know whether he could get elected today.' Clyburn helped revive Biden's badly flagging presidential campaign earlier this year, lifting him to a decisive win in a South Carolina primary in which large numbers of voters were black. That fueled a Biden run to a string of victories in other state contests that resulted in his becoming the party's presumptive nominee. On MSNBC, Biden said the tensions in Minnesota following the death of George Floyd have 'nothing to do with my running mate.' Pressed on whether Floyd's killing increases pressure to place an African American woman on his ticket, Biden said he's talked about putting women of color on the Supreme Court and in his Cabinet. 'And I also already said that there are women of color under consideration,"" he said. Klobuchar did not respond to a request Friday by The Associated Press for an interview. On CNN, she sidestepped a question about her vice presidential prospects. 'He's going to make the best decision on whoever he wants to govern with,' she said of Biden. Before being elected to the Senate in 2006, Klobuchar, who is white, spent eight years as prosecutor for Minnesota's largest county. Most of the more than two dozen people who died during police encounters in her tenure were people of color, according to data compiled by Communities United Against Police Brutality and news articles reviewed by the AP. An officer involved in one of those past fatal incidents was Derek Chauvin, who was arrested and charged Friday in this week's death of Floyd. A video showing Floyd complaining that he could not breathe as Chauvin kneeled on his neck has helped spark unrest in cities around the country. Chauvin was among six officers who fired on and killed a man in 2006 who reportedly stabbed two people and then aimed a shotgun at police. Chauvin's 2006 case went to the grand jury after Klobuchar was elected to the Senate and had left the county attorney's office. Mike Freeman, Klobuchar's successor as prosecutor, made 'all prosecutorial decisions"" about Chauvin, according to a Freeman statement that Klobuchar's office provided Saturday. Klobuchar told MSNBC that she now believes the practice of asking a grand jury to decide whether to charge officers was wrong. Klobuchar and 27 other Democratic senators wrote Friday to the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division, asking it to investigate 'patterns and practices of racially discriminatory and violent policing' by the Minneapolis police. ___ AP reporters Sara Burnett in Chicago and Will Weissert in Washington contributed to this report.",0.0

Rep. James Clyburn, D-S.C., told reporters on Friday that while he believes Klobuchar is 'absolutely' qualified to be vice president, 'This is very tough timing for her.' Klobuchar was a prosecutor years ago in the county that includes Minneapolis. During that period, more than two dozen people "" mostly minorities "" died during encounters with police. Following customary practice at the time, she sent the cases to grand juries, which brought no criminal charges against any of the officers involved. Clyburn, who called his view a 'gut feeling,' played a pivotal role in helping Biden become the Democratic Party's all-but-certain presidential nominee. Clyburn is the No. 3 House Democratic leader and Congress' highest-ranking black lawmaker. 'So often in politics, timing really dictates things. Barack Obama I don't think could have gotten elected four years before he got elected,"" Clyburn said of the former president during a conference call. 'And I don't know whether he could get elected today.' Clyburn helped revive Biden's badly flagging presidential campaign earlier this year, lifting him to a decisive win in a South Carolina primary in which large numbers of voters were black. That fueled a Biden run to a string of victories in other state contests that resulted in his becoming the party's presumptive nominee. On MSNBC, Biden said the tensions in Minnesota following the death of George Floyd have 'nothing to do with my running mate.' Pressed on whether Floyd's killing increases pressure to place an African American woman on his ticket, Biden said he's talked about putting women of color on the Supreme Court and in his Cabinet. 'And I also already said that there are women of color under consideration,"" he said. Klobuchar did not respond to a request Friday by The Associated Press for an interview. On CNN, she sidestepped a question about her vice presidential prospects. 'He's going to make the best decision on whoever he wants to govern with,' she said of Biden. Before being elected to the Senate in 2006, Klobuchar, who is white, spent eight years as prosecutor for Minnesota's largest county. Most of the more than two dozen people who died during police encounters in her tenure were people of color, according to data compiled by Communities United Against Police Brutality and news articles reviewed by the AP. An officer involved in one of those past fatal incidents was Derek Chauvin, who was arrested and charged Friday in this week's death of Floyd. A video showing Floyd complaining that he could not breathe as Chauvin kneeled on his neck has helped spark unrest in cities around the country. Chauvin was among six officers who fired on and killed a man in 2006 who reportedly stabbed two people and then aimed a shotgun at police. Chauvin's 2006 case went to the grand jury after Klobuchar was elected to the Senate and had left the county attorney's office. Mike Freeman, Klobuchar's successor as prosecutor, made 'all prosecutorial decisions"" about Chauvin, according to a Freeman statement that Klobuchar's office provided Saturday. Klobuchar told MSNBC that she now believes the practice of asking a grand jury to decide whether to charge officers was wrong. Klobuchar and 27 other Democratic senators wrote Friday to the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division, asking it to investigate 'patterns and practices of racially discriminatory and violent policing' by the Minneapolis police. ___ AP reporters Sara Burnett in Chicago and Will Weissert in Washington contributed to this report.",0.0

1620669199,2020-05-29 13:32:02,NH Now: Jeanne Shaheen 5-29-20,https://nhtalkradio.com/?p=14091,en,False,,113600,concordnewsradio.com,http://concordnewsradio.com/,"Q: Should the Officer Involved with George Floyd’s Death Be Arrested While the Case Is Being Investigated? A: “One Would Think. Based on the Video, I Was Surprised to Hear the County Attorney’s Response That He Didn’t Have Enough Evidence. People Want to See Swift Action. They Want to See That Justice Is Being Done.” In an Interview with WKXL’s Chris Ryan, Senator Jeanne Shaheen discusses the unrest in Minneapolis after the death of an African American, George Floyd, while he was in police custody; the COVID-19 pandemic; and President Trump’s divisive comments and actions. The Senator feels that a terrible situation has been exacerbated by President Trump tweeting criticisms of Minnesota Governor Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Frey. She calls on the President to lead not divide. Senator Shaheen also recognizes the terrible disparity between black and white in our country in criminal justice and even in how minority communities are more impacted by the Coronavirus. The final portion of the interview deals with the $3 trillion HEROES-Health and Emergency Recovery Omnibus Emergency Solutions Act which was passed by the House of Representatives and is awaiting consideration by the Senate. Senator Shaheen criticizes Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s for dragging his feet when so many people need the help which this stimulus package would bring. The Senator believes that the lockdown has left many groups in need of help: state and local governments need to avoid laying off municipal employees due to lost revenues; the elimination of elective procedures have forced hospitals to consider layoffs; the assistance given to small businesses by the CARES-Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act and their laid off employees runs out on June 30; support is needed for long term care facilities which have been the epicenter of deaths due to COVID-19; and families are on long lines at food banks. Senator Jeanne Shaheen wants these problems addressed ASAP. However, there is nothing scheduled on the Senate calendar for this Monday.",0.0

It looks like you hate all white people. You should be ashamed of yourself, A man of your age. It’s people like you who drive people like me to vote for the MAN, Donald Trump. MAGA."" Such ugly messages – as that above received last week – are not uncommon in my inbox. Few, however, are as honest and as illustrative – linking racism and Donald Trump – of an America that, even at a time of economic collapse and pandemic, continues to be plagued by a contagion more persistent, more pernicious than the presence of COVID-19. An America that continues to be plagued by its original sin – racism. This past week, after Christian Cooper, a 57-year-old black birdwatcher asked a 41-year-old white dog-walker, Amy Cooper (no relation), to leash her dog in the Bramble, an area of New York’s Central Park where leashing is required, the fragile white woman exercising her implicit privilege and power – responded by calling the police saying ""an African American man in Central Park ... is recording me and threatened myself and my dog … Please send a cop! Immediately!"" In Minnesota this past week cops immediately responded to a non-violent allegation of forgery in Minneapolis. As a result, a black man, George Floyd, was killed after Derek Chauvin, a white Minneapolis police officer – in the presence of three other policemen – exercising his privilege and power –b unyieldingly pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck as he, handcuffed and prone on the asphalt, shouted he couldn’t breathe. ""Please, the knee in my neck, I can’t breathe, sir."" ""He should not have died,"" Minneapolis Mayor Frey said. ""What we saw was horrible, completely and utterly messed up. ... Whatever the investigation reveals, it does not change the simple truth that he should be with us this morning."" ""Being black in America should not be a death sentence,"" the mayor continued. ""When you hear someone calling for help, you are supposed to help. This officer failed in the most basic human sense."" Being black – being a person of color – in America shouldn’t be a death sentence – how many times must that sentiment be repeated, how many lives lost to prove the point? Indeed, how many lives may have been lost because there were no witnesses, no bystanders video recording deaths and lynchings. On Wednesday, as headlines lamented that more than 100,000 Americans had died of COVID-19 within approximately 100 days, it was also reported, less breathlessly, that with 20,000 deaths, African Americans are dying of the virus at three times the rate of white people. It was reported that COVID-19 is twice as deadly for black and Latinos than whites in New York City; that African Americans are 70% of all coronavirus cases in Chicago – which is 30% black. ""Please, the knee in my neck, I can’t breathe, sir."" Within America’s native communities the toll has been as deadly. The Navajo Nation has infection rates higher than any state: for example, in New Mexico, where Native Americans are 11% of the population they account for more than 50% of the COVID-19 cases. America’s minority communities and communities of color disproportionately suffer from COVID-19 because they have been oppressed – institutionally, medically, educationally, economically and politically disenfranchised – for generations, oppressed by a structural racism that has left their communities vulnerable and marginalized and less able to cope with the health impacts of a pandemic like COVID-19. ""Please, the knee in my neck, I can’t breathe, sir."" Their oppressors – including those like my critic whom I quote above – refuse to recognize that their privilege has – and continues to – dehumanize others, resulting in a system where black lives matter less than white lives. Their insistence in believing they have rights superior to individuals whom they believe are unworthy, untrustworthy, lazy, and ungrateful for the opportunities patronizingly offered to them by the dominant white class. It is within this racist paradigm that MAGA world thrives, a reality where, as Trump addressed the Veterans of Foreign Wars Convention in 2018: ""Just remember, what you are seeing and what you are reading is not what's happening."" A reality where anything that is not ""Trump’s"" truth is a lie. Trump’s reality – that which offends urban elites, immigrants, media and non-whites – is what mobilizes MAGA. Indeed, the more incompetent, incoherent and unhinged Trump is, the more loyal they are – and the more exploited they are. In the end they, too – unconsciously – are losing their breath, their lives, their jobs. They – unconsciously – within their resentments and grievances, are today betraying their own identities, families, and faiths; today losing their humanity. Sadly, MAGA world cannot see that in the pursuit of securing their dominance as oppressor they are dehumanizing themselves, that as they’re dehumanizing the Other they’re dehumanizing themselves. If one is to breathe we must all breathe together. ""As long as I fight,"" Paulo Freire offered in Pedagogy of the Oppressed, ""I am moved by hope; and if I fight with hope, then I can wait."" I fight with hope, and I can wait. Epilogue: ""A riot is the language of the unheard,"" Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., said in 1966 and Thursday night in Minneapolis and in other cities – after I had written the column above – many protesters who had taken to the streets to protest the murder of George Floyd by police officers in full view of a shocked public turned to rioting and looting – in defiance of their oppressors – to demonstrate their opposition to a legal system that systematically fails to defend them. Fails to defend Trayvone Martin, Eric Garner, Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, and George Floyd. Fails to listen to the unheard. ""Please, the knee in my neck, I can’t breathe, sir.""

Police shut down Elm and Chestnut streets for the march. Protesters chanted “black lives matter” and “hands up, don’t shoot.” ""We're losing black lives constantly to police brutality and racism. Constantly. It's not one incident. It's not two incidents. It's constant, and we're exhausted,"" said Tyrell Whitted, one of the protest's organizers.While violence has erupted elsewhere in the U.S., the protest in Manchester was peaceful.

1621070456,2020-05-30 09:06:01,At Least 2 Killed In Nationwide Protests Over George Floyd's Death,https://www.nhpr.org/post/least-2-killed-amid-nationwide-protests-over-george-floyds-death,en,False,,22716,nhpr.org,http://www.nhpr.org,"Updated at 1:42 p.m. ET Saturday Angry protests nationwide on Friday followed the death of George Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis. Clashes erupted between activists and law enforcement in many locations, and at least two people were dead by Saturday morning. Demonstrators nationwide have taken to the streets after Floyd died while being arrested in Minneapolis. A video shows a police officer kneeling on his neck for at least seven minutes; Floyd is heard begging for the police to stop and saying he cannot breathe. That police officer has been arrested and charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. Three other officers were present but have not been charged. All four were fired earlier in the week. One person was killed in Detroit as hundreds of people gathered in the city's downtown area as part of the nationwide protests. As WXYZ TV, an ABC News affiliate, reported, a Detroit Police Department spokesperson said, ""A grey Dodge Durango pulled up and fired into the crowd, striking a 19-year-old man."" The shooting did not involve police. Protesters were allowed to march in the streets until shortly before midnight when officers, outfitted in riot gear, began firing tear gas into the crowds, according to the news station. Officials said at least nine people were arrested after the demonstrations were pronounced to be unlawful gatherings. In Oakland, Calif., a contract security officer for the Federal Protective Service was killed and another injured in a shooting at the Ronald V. Dellums Federal Building on Friday night, according to a statement from the FBI. The service is part of the Department of Homeland Security. The officers were shot after a vehicle approached the building, and ""an individual inside the vehicle began firing."" Authorities have not linked the shooting with the protests, though the incident is under a joint investigation by the Oakland Police Department and local FBI office. In Minneapolis, after a night of rioting, looting and setting a number of businesses ablaze on Thursday, the situation seemed calmer early Friday. Officials there appeared to take a nonconfrontational approach to people marching through the city for much of the day, despite some instances of civil disorder. But as the hours passed and protesters ignored a citywide 8 p.m. curfew, law enforcement reversed course. The new strategy included deploying a column of National Guard troops, including armored vehicles, to respond to protests near the 5th Precinct. People had set fire to the 3rd Precinct on Thursday night, forcing police to abandon the building. On Friday night, protesters also reportedly were seen breaking into a Wells Fargo Bank, which was also torched. At an early morning press conference on Saturday, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey urged demonstrators to go home. Walz said he understood the rage felt across the nation but condemned what he called ""wanton destruction."" ""This is not grieving,"" he said. ""This is not making a statement. This is life-threatening and dangerous to the most well-qualified forces out there."" Frey said he was ""reeling"" along with the rest of his city over Floyd's death but emphasized that ""there is no honor in burning down your city."" He pointed out that local businesses and institutions that many citizens depend on amid the coronavirus pandemic that had been destroyed. Major Gen. Jon Jensen announced the state's National Guard was preparing to deploy 1,700 soldiers. The action would be the largest deployment within Minnesota in the state's history. ""They are telling our stories, and you are disgracing their building"" In other cities, most of the demonstrations began peacefully, but as the day unfolded and night fell, they became increasingly violent. That was true in Atlanta, where a crowd of protesters outside of an entrance to CNN's headquarters on Friday evening repeatedly threw rocks at officers attempting to keep them from rushing into the building. Armed with riot gear, more than a dozen officers braced as they endured attacks from protesters with rocks, smoke grenades, and apparently BB rounds. At one point, protesters threw a flashbang that detonated in a small lobby. In response, Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp issued a state of emergency around midnight. ""At the request of Mayor [Keisha Lance Bottoms] & in consultation with public safety & emergency preparedness officials, I have issued a State of Emergency for Fulton County to activate as many as 500 [Georgia National Guard] troops to protect people & property in Atlanta,"" Kemp announced in a tweet. .@CNNValencia and crew take cover after an explosion takes place in the space between protesters and police at the CNN Center in Atlanta. https://t.co/mHZFrcOZj7 pic.twitter.com/HLPzyoKgn9 — CNN (@CNN) May 30, 2020 Earlier in the day, a police vehicle was set on fire — an act of vandalism reporters have cited as a turning point in the day's activities. Bottoms pleaded with those marching in the streets to stop rioting. ""You are burning cars, you have defaced the CNN building. Ted Turner started CNN in Atlanta 40 years ago because he believed in who we are as a city. ... They are telling our stories, and you are disgracing their building,"" Bottoms said in a televised interview. Others who had surrounded CNN's headquarters, smashed the building's windows and sprayed graffiti on the network's logo. The messages scrawled on the building included insults to President Trump, along with #Love and ""no cops."" Peaceful vigil in Portland, Ore., escalates Protesters gathered peacefully Friday evening in Portland, Ore., but the demonstration eventually led to violence. Members of the crowd marched to the Multnomah County Justice Center, which houses the county jail and police headquarters. Video showed several protesters breaking windows. The police department said a small fire was lit in the building. The Portland Police Bureau later declared a riot in the city and ordered protesters to go home. In a tweet, it said people who did not comply would be ""subject to gas, projectiles, and other means necessary for dispersal."" PPB has declared a riot. The following is closed to all traffic, pedestrians and vehicles: SW Naito Pkwy west to SW 13th Ave is closed from SW Lincoln north to NW Everett St. Disperse now or you will be subject to gas, projectiles, and other means necessary for dispersal. — Portland Police (@PortlandPolice) May 30, 2020 Mayor Ted Wheeler responded to the incident on Twitter, urging protesters to remain peaceful. ""Portland, this is NOT us,"" he wrote. ""When you destroy our city, you are destroying our community. When you act in violence against each other, you are hurting all of us. How does this honor the legacy of George Floyd? Protest, speak truth, but don't tear your city apart in the process."" As the demonstrations grew more violent, Wheeler took to Twitter again, announcing that he would be returning to the city to speak to police. Wheeler wrote that he had to leave the city to be at the side of his dying mother. ENOUGH.  I had to leave Portland today because my mother is dying. I am with family to prepare for her final moments. This is hard, this is personal, but so is watching my city get destroyed.  I’m coming back NOW. You will be hearing from me, @PortlandPolice, community leaders. — Mayor Ted Wheeler (@tedwheeler) May 30, 2020 Los Angeles crowd descends on uniformed officer In Los Angeles, an angry crowd rushed into the streets amid oncoming traffic. At one point, an officer grabbed a male activist in an attempt to restrain him. After a brief tussle, a throng of protesters pulled the officer to the ground. They descended on the uniformed officer, kicking and hitting him with protest signs. Eventually, a man in civilian clothing pulled the officer out of the melee. Dozens of people later marched onto the 110 Freeway blocking all of the northbound lanes. But as the sun set, some protesters became more destructive. One group busted the windows of a downtown Starbucks and other local restaurants. Others set trash cans on fire and pushed dumpsters toward lines of police officers. At about 10:30 p.m. local time, the police department declared an unlawful assembly throughout the core downtown area. ""This is being made following repeated acts of violence & property damage,"" officials said on Twitter. We have declared an unlawful assembly throughout Downtown LA.

Many took a knee while others chanted, ""Don't Shoot."" Football player Colin Kaepernick became well-known for kneeling during the national anthem to protest racial injustice. The image is going viral again. Shortly afterward, Secret Service officials said ""personnel are currently assisting other law enforcement agencies during a demonstration"" in the park across from the White House. Law enforcement struggled with protesters over metal barricades that form one of the layers of protection around the White House. Protesters remained at the White House early Saturday morning, shoving police as they stood outside with shields. At one point, police appeared to attempt to disperse the crowd by using tear gas or pepper spray.

Protesters threw water bottles and chanted insults at police. In a video captured by a local reporter, police can be seen wielding batons and beating several protesters to the ground, and at one point spraying a crowd with a repellent, and making arrests. ""Our police officers have been given a very clear instruction: As always, respect peaceful protest. We in this city have a long history of respecting every kind of viewpoint, that is the essence of New York City,"" Mayor Bill de Blasio said in a press conference Friday. The Associated Press reports in Brooklyn, at least one New York Police Department van was set on fire by demonstrators twice. At least 200 demonstrators were arrested Friday and a dozen NYPD officers injured, according to local reports. Seventy protesters were taken into custody on Thursday. In Denver, windows were smashed, fires burned late into the night Demonstrators in Denver gathered peacefully at noon Friday, for the second day in a row, at the state Capitol and downtown, according to local reports. Protesters chanted, ""Say his name — George Floyd,"" and other slogans but eventually struggles broke out with police. Protesters defaced a statue on the Capitol steps, and spray-painted ""I can't breathe"" and other graffiti on pillars. On the video, Floyd can be heard pleading for his life and saying he couldn't breathe. According to local reports, demonstrators broke windows and threw water bottles and rocks at police officers, who threw flash bangs, shot pepper pellets and sprayed tear gas at crowds. Tay Anderson, a Denver school board member and community organizer, said in a tweet that those who took part in violence Friday were asked to stop by protest organizers. We asked white allies to go home and some of them still insisted throwing rocks, bottles, etc. at police.  The police responded with gas and rubber bullets.

The marchers gathered in spite of fears of the coronavirus to join with demonstrators across America who have taken to the streets in the wake of the killing of George Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis earlier this week. Led by a police escort which blocked traffic in one direction, the crowd of hundreds marched down Elm Street in Manchester. They chanted “Black Lives Matter” and “hands up, don't shoot."" Melissa Sandoval of Dover, aware of the risks from COVID-19, did her best to keep her distance from others during the march. But she ultimately decided the risk was worth it to be heard. “I've had to watch way too many videos of people dying right in front of me, needlessly,” said Sandoval, “people who look like my brother, people who look like me.” While the demonstration was largely spurred by events in Minneapolis, Sandoval said the same problems of racism exist here in New Hampshire. “I’ve lived in Dover for two years, and I’ve heard about the things that have happened in the high school,” she said, referring to a 2018 incident where Dover High School students sang a song about the Ku Klux Klan as part of a class assignment. Maria McNaught of Merrimack also overcame her fears of the virus to join the crowd on a mobility scooter. “I actually have an immuno-deficiency problem so I shouldn't be out among people like this, but I just couldn't let is pass,” said McNaught, through her mask. “I just had to be here.” “This has been going on for over 400 years and it’s time to stop and it’s time for the police to start paying for what they’ve been doing,” said McNaught. Following the march, the Manchester Police Department said the demonstration, in which it said about 800 people participated, was peaceful and that attendees “were very respectful of others, as well as police.” One tense moment unfolded near the police department a few hours after the main demonstration, according to police. In a statement, the Manchester Police Department said that around 1:30 p.m., ""a truck drove up and the occupants and the protestors had a verbal altercation. In a nearby parking lot one of the occupants of the truck got out and displayed a gun. Manchester Police Officers took that individual and one other into custody. The individuals are being booked and their identities will be released a little later on.” Photos obtained by NHPR from a spectator show a Trump flag flying in the bed of the truck. Later, Manchester police identified the two men arrested as Scott and Mark Kimball. Both have been charged with felony riot and criminal threatening. In a tweet, Governor Chris Sununu said he spoke with organizers of the march Saturday morning to lend them his support. “The State of NH stands with them in their calls for justice. This important conversation must continue and we must constructively work together as a nation to ensure there is change,” Sununu tweeted. On Friday, Sununu was asked by reporters whether New Hampshire state troopers had acted appropriately during the arrest of an African-American man in Albany earlier this month. A video posted on social media shows the man being dragged out of his car by two state troopers after they break his car window in after he allegedly resisted arrest. Sununu said the state is “looking into” the incident to determine if the officers’ behavior followed policy. (This post was updated Saturday evening with information from the Manchester Police Department about two arrests made in connection with a verbal altercation with protesters.)",0.0

""It was not enough,"" Maj. Gen. Jon A. Jensen said Saturday. Now, with a fifth night of protests looming, Jensen, head of the state's National Guard, said authorities are drastically increasing the military presence in Minneapolis. Officials expected to deploy some 2,500 soldiers and airmen by midday Saturday and will soon mobilize the state's full National Guard force of more than 13,000 — ""an action that has never been taken in 164-year history of the Minnesota National Guard,"" according to Gov. Tim Walz, who spoke at a joint news conference with Jensen. ""We understand the work that we need to do and the generational pain that went into what happened with George Floyd and that murder,"" the governor said Saturday. ""But at this point in time, nothing we do to address those inequities, nothing we do to provide justice to George Floyd and his family that I spoke with last evening — none of those things matter to any of these people who are out there firing upon National Guard, burning businesses of our communities and making intent on disrupting any semblance of civil life."" The Pentagon has also placed as many as 800 members of the military police on prepare-to-deploy orders, a U.S. official confirmed to NPR. The officers would be available to assist with logistics, analysis or surveillance if requested by the governor. More than 1,000 additional Citizen-Soldiers and Airmen are activating today. This is in addition to the 700 that were on duty as of late last night. This represents the largest domestic deployment in the Minnesota’s National Guard’s 164-year history. pic.twitter.com/aV9NOFv5uo — MN National Guard (@MNNationalGuard) May 30, 2020 Less than a week has passed since Floyd's death in police custody. The disturbing video of his arrest, filmed by a bystander Monday evening in Minneapolis, shows Officer Derek Chauvin with his knee on the neck of the handcuffed black man for more than seven minutes. The white police officer — who has since been fired and charged with murder — continues to plant his weight on Floyd well after his pleas for help give way to an unresponsive silence. A federal investigation remains underway into the incident, with more charges possible for Chauvin and the three other officers seen in the video. That has not satisfied protesters, whose furor over Floyd's death has spread well beyond Minneapolis. A slew of cities — from Detroit to Atlanta, from Los Angeles to Washington, D.C. — have seen protesters gather to voice their outrage about police treatment of African Americans. In many of those cities, gatherings turned violent, with some protesters clashing with police and damaging buildings. Law enforcement reported hundreds of arrests across the country and at least one death — a 19-year-old man who was killed when someone fired into a crowd in Detroit, according to local police. Several people were also injured by gunfire Thursday night in Louisville, Ky., where crowds have gathered to protest a grievance closer to home: the death of Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old black woman who was shot and killed by police in her own apartment earlier this year. There were no incidents of gun violence linked to the protests Friday night in Louisville, but NPR member station WFPL reports that clashes erupted between protesters and police. Protesters shattered windows at the courthouse, and police fired tear gas to disperse the crowds, according to WFPL. On Saturday, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear announced that he, too, was calling up the National Guard, in order ""to help keep peace in Louisville."" ""I hope everybody knows this is a big step and a tough step, and it's not one intended to silence any voice, because I want to hear,"" Beshear said in a statement explaining the move. ""But I want to make sure at the end of the day that we are all safe."" President Trump weighed in on the protests Saturday. He said the best way to honor Floyd's memory is for authorities to ""get tougher"" on the protesters who resort to violence, whom he called ""radical left, bad people [who] have got to be taught that you can't do this."" ""They've got to be tough, they've got to be smart,"" Trump said of state officials. ""We have our military ready, willing and able if they ever want to call on our military. But we could have troops on the ground very quickly if they ever want our military."" In a statement Saturday, Attorney General William Barr echoed Trump's comments, saying that though the outrage is ""real and legitimate,"" the protests are ""being hijacked by violent radical elements."" ""Groups of outside radicals and agitators are exploiting the situation to pursue their own separate and violent agenda,"" Barr said. ""In many places, it appears the violence is planned, organized, and driven by anarchistic and far left extremists, using Antifa-like tactics, many of whom travel from out of state to promote the violence.""

Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) during a campaign event on March 2, 2020 in Dallas, Texas. Klobuchar has suspended her campaign and endorsed Biden before the upcoming Super Tuesday Democratic presidential primaries. (Photo by Ron Jenkins/Getty Images) Advertisement Biden ally sees Klobuchar as less likely Biden running mate Share Shares Copy Link Copy Sen. Amy Klobuchar seems a less likely choice to become Joe Biden's running mate on his presidential ticket following this week's death of a black man in police custody in Minneapolis, a key ally of the former vice president said Friday. Rep. James Clyburn, D-S.C., told reporters that while he believes Klobuchar is “absolutely” qualified to be vice president, “This is very tough timing for her.” Klobuchar, D-Minn., was a prosecutor years ago in the county that includes Minneapolis. As she was leaving the post to join the Senate, an officer involved in this week’s death of George Floyd was involved in the death of another man. The officer ultimately was not prosecuted. Clyburn, who said his view was his “gut feeling,” played a pivotal role in helping Biden become the party’s all-but-certain presidential nominee. Clyburn is the No. 3 House Democratic leader and Congress’ highest-ranking black lawmaker.Related: NY protesters demand justice for George Floyd“So often in politics, timing really dictates things, Barack Obama I don’t think could have gotten elected four years before he got elected,"" Clyburn said of the former president during a conference call. “And I don’t know whether he could get elected today.”On MSNBC, Biden said the tensions in Minnesota have “nothing to do with my running mate.” Pressed on whether Floyd’s killing increases pressure to place an African American woman on his ticket, Biden said he's talked about putting women of color on the Supreme Court and in his Cabinet. “And I also already said that there are women of color under consideration,"" he said. Clyburn helped revive Biden’s badly flagging presidential campaign earlier this year, lifting him to a decisive triumph in a South Carolina primary in which large numbers of voters were black. That fueled a Biden run to a string of victories in other state contests that resulted in his becoming the party’s presumptive nominee. Before being elected to the Senate in 2006, Klobuchar, who is white, was prosecutor of Minnesota's largest county, which includes Minneapolis. While Klobuchar was in that job, more than two dozen citizens died during encounters with police but none of the officers involved were criminally charged. Most victims were people of color, according to data compiled by Communities United Against Police Brutality and news articles reviewed by the AP. An officer involved in one of the past fatal incidents was Derek Chauvin, who was arrested and charged Friday in this week's death of Floyd. A video showing Floyd complaining that he could not breath as Chauvin kneeled on his neck has helped spark unrest in cities around the country. Chauvin was among six officers who fired on and killed a man in 2006 who reportedly stabbed two people and then aimed a shotgun at police. The case went to the grand jury after Klobuchar had been elected to the Senate and had left the county attorney’s office. Klobuchar did not respond to a request by The Associated Press for an interview on Friday. But she told NBC news that reports stating she had declined the case involving Chauvin years ago were “absolutely false.”Klobuchar told the network that during the years she led the office, it was the practice to present police shooting cases to a grand jury to consider charges. She said she now believes the practice of asking a grand jury to decide whether to charge officers was wrong. Klobuchar and 27 other Democratic senators wrote a letter Friday to the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division, asking it to investigate “patterns and practices of racially discriminatory and violent policing” by the Minneapolis police. ___AP reporters Sara Burnett in Chicago and Will Weissert in Washington contributed to this report.",0.0

1621232927,2020-05-30 18:33:52,"Manchester police: Man with Trump flag on truck drives by protesters, pulls gun, gets arrested",https://www.fosters.com/news/20200530/manchester-police-man-with-trump-flag-on-truck-drives-by-protesters-pulls-gun-gets-arrested?rssfeed=true,en,False,,82445,fosters.com,http://www.fosters.com/#spider,"MANCHESTER, NH – A peaceful sit-in by Black Lives Matters protesters outside the Manchester Police Department Saturday was interrupted when a truck displaying a large Trump flag drove by the group at about 1:30 p.m. A confrontation between the truck’s driver and the group ended with a gun threat and two arrests. The driver of the truck, Scott Kimball, 43, and passenger, his son, Mark Kimball, 19, were arrested and charged with felony riot and felony criminal threatening, according to police. As of 5 p.m., there was still ""activity"" outside the police station, said Lt. Shawn McCabe, and the building remained closed to visitors for the ""safety of officers and employees."" Police declined to say where the two men were from. Stacy Harrison, a photographer on assignment for Manchester Ink Link, was at the scene when it unfolded. She said a small group of protesters gathered at the police station at 405 Valley St. after the Elm Street demonstration. It was an effort to initiate a dialog with law enforcement, according to organizers of the earlier march, which drew an estimated 1,000 people. The march itself was peaceful and organizers even had two people offering participants free face masks (cognizant of social distancing in the age of COVID-19) in baskets at the end of ski poles. At the police station, however, things turned ugly when a young man saw a black pickup truck with a huge Trump flag in its bed heading up Valley Street, from Elm Street, and nearing the police station. Harrison said the protester, who she described as a black man in his late teens or early 20s, started swearing. She turned to see what he was looking at and saw the truck. The driver and passenger were both white males. ""Every nasty possible thing you can think he was swearing at the truck,"" she said. Harrison said as the truck crawled by her and her 15-year-old daughter, the occupants of the truck – a driver and passenger – began hurling insults at the young man. The young man responded with his own diatribe. She thought those in the truck were going to yell whatever they were going to yell and then keep going but then the young man went toward the truck and a heated exchange took place. ""They were yelling the ""N"" word,"" she said. ""They were screaming at each other and I heard the word ""Trump"" a few times."" By then other people saw what was happening and headed toward the truck as well. ""They all sort of swarmed like a bunch of bees towards the truck,"" she said. The driver pulled the truck over into the parking lot outside Associated Concrete Coatings and the yelling continued. Someone threw something that was white – Harrison thought it might be a piece of paper, a bottle cap or a water bottle – which bounced off the driver’s window. Then she saw something black being waved around by someone in the truck and heard shouts of, ""He’s got a gun. He’s got a gun."" Officers immediately surrounded the truck. Initially, she said there were 20 to 25 officers but more streamed out of the station. She estimated there were about 60 officers in the street by the time two men were taken into custody. Melissa Bernardin, a longtime resident of Concord, was also at police headquarters when the violence erupted. She had come to Manchester Saturday morning to support the cause, and was part of the group that moved from Elm Street to police headquarters. ""By the time I arrived the situation had gone from tense to a positive dialogue with police,"" Bernardin said. At some point she said she noticed a pick-up truck drive slowly by the police station displaying a large Trump flag. Several minutes later she saw the same truck coming back from the other direction. She regarded the people in the truck as instigators. ""Some of the protesters who also saw the truck started yelling at the truck. I recall seeing a protester throw a water bottle at the truck. At that point I started running toward the truck to try and deescalate the situation because I know it wasn’t going to turn into anything good,"" Bernardin said. ""I saw the driver of the truck jump out with a gun at which point I ran away to seek shelter behind a concrete lamp post, but I heard the driver cocked and pointed the gun at the crowd. And then I heard that the passenger got out and drew his gun out of his holster but that he didn’t point it at anyone."" Although Manchester is far removed from Minneapolis, she suspects people came out in solidarity with the Black Life Matters movement here for the same reason she did. ""The issue of racism and police brutality in our country is one that touches all communities, and while there may be different levels of racism and police brutality against people of color in different communities, we all feel every human deserves to be treated with dignity,"" Bernardin says. ""We feel solidarity with individuals who are killed at the hands of police."" She says she considers herself a white ally of the Black Lives Matter movement. ""I’ve personally come to an understanding of how prevalent racism and violence against people of color is in our society through reading and learning and following the news, and the more you follow it the more heartbreaking it is,"" Bernardin said. ""I can’t see any way not to join a protest in solidarity with those being directly affected by police brutality."" She said she’s thankful the day’s events were mostly peaceful. ""I’m thankful the men who jumped out of the truck with guns didn’t kill anyone. It’s terrifying to me that a group of people who show up in public to demonstrate because they care about the intrinsic value of human life could have to face down such a terrifying threat."" In a news release, police agreed that the Black Lives Matter demonstration earlier in the day was peaceful and those in attendance were respectful of each other and police. No one was arrested. After the march, 100 people gathered outside the station when about 1:30 p.m. the confrontation occurred Police confirmed one of the truck’s occupants pulled out a gun – they did not say whether it was the passenger or driver – but both were taken into custody. They were being booked Saturday afternoon. Police said their identities will be released later. People remained outside the station after the arrests were made. Police Chief Carlo Capano and Assistant Chief Ryan Grant talked with protesters following the arrests. In one video recording, posted online by Matthew Lawrence, Capano is heard talking about what happened to George Floyd, the Minneapolis man who died after Officer Derek Chauvin held his foot on Floyd’s neck for nine minutes. Chauvin is charged with third-degree murder. ""[What happened to George Floyd] disgusts me and every police officer standing behind me,"" Capano said. ""Nobody hates a bad cop more than a good cop."" As of 2:30 p.m., some people were still outside the police station. Police said while the department is open, the building is closed ""for the safety of our officers and employees,"" according to the news release issued by Public Information Officer Heather Hamel.

1621232926,2020-05-30 18:39:50,"1,000 rally in Manchester for Black Lives Matter march",https://www.fosters.com/news/20200530/1000-rally-in-manchester-for-black-lives-matter-march?rssfeed=true,en,False,,82445,fosters.com,http://www.fosters.com/#spider,"MANCHESTER — More than 1,000 people took to the streets Saturday morning as part of a peaceful protest against the killings of unarmed black men around the country. “We plan to stand in solidarity with the people who are assassinated in our country,” said Tyrell Whitted, a Manchester resident and one of the march organizers with Black Lives Matter. The nation is being rocked by the May 25 death of George Floyd in Minneapolis seemingly at the hands of police, and the resulting protests – and in some cases riots. Four Minneapolis police officers involved in the arrest have been fired. One of them, Derek Chauvin was arrested and charged Friday with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter in Floyd’s death. “I believe that when justice isn’t served the people are going to react,” Whitted said. People started gathering at Veteran’s Memorial Park Saturday morning ahead of the march, ready with signs, and the ever-present face masks to help curb the spread of COVID-19. By and large, the marchers want to see change following the death of Floyd and others, including another recent victim, Ahmaud Arbery. In February, Arbery, an African-American, was chased down by two white men, a father and son, and shot to death. The killing took place in February, but no arrests were made until after a video of the incident leaked to the press months later. “I’m so outraged I can’t even articulate my anger,” said Carla Giorgi or Manchester. Giorgi, a white woman raising an African American son, said she fears for her child’s life as he grows up in America, given the violence African Americans are subject to. Giorgi’s friend, Helena Laquinta, of Nashua, said white people have a responsibility to minorities to end the racial injustices that are killing them. “We built this systemic racism, so we have to be the ones who change it,” Laquinta said. India Barrows, a Manchester resident and an African American, said the country needs to stop harming minorities. The violence and discrimination minorities face from civil authorities in New Hampshire is a long-standing problem, she said. “This has been happening since I was 18,” Barrows said. James McKim, president of the Manchester chapter of the NAACP, attended the march to support the Black Lives Matter movement. “We have to talk about the scourge of racism and discrimination in this country,” McKim said. McKim said that while race relations in New Hampshire are good overall, racism is real and it does lasting harm. He’s currently dealing with officials involved in Albany where two New Hampshire State Troopers were caught on video smashing into the car of Jean Saint Preux, an African American, and pulling him out of his vehicle by his dreadlocks. McKim said he’s spoken with police and FBI agents about that case. McKim said the problem stems from people not seeing the full human dignity in other people, and then treating them as less than human. “Many people don’t see others as individuals,” McKim said. Minneapolis Police Officer Derek Chauvin was captured on video with his knee on Floyd’s neck during an arrest as Floyd can be heard begging for air. Floyd later died and it took authorities in Minneapolis days to arrest Chauvin and charge him with third-degree murder. Saturday’s march had protesters headed down Elm Street past City Hall chanting “No Justice, No Peace,” “Black Lives Matter,” and “Hands Up, Don’t Shoot,” among other refrains. The march and rally afterward were peaceful, with Manchester police providing traffic control to clear the road for marchers. Gov. Chris Sununu issued the following statement following the rally: “This morning I called the organizers ahead of the George Floyd March in Manchester to let them know the State of New Hampshire stands with them in their calls for justice,” said Gov. Chris Sununu. “This important conversation must continue and we must constructively work together as a nation to ensure there is change.” Manchester Police Chief Carl Capano is seen on the video engaging with the protesters and talking about Floyd’s death. “[What happened to George Floyd] disgusts me and every police officer standing behind me,” Capano said. “Nobody hates a bad cop more than a good cop.”",0.0

Protests continued following the death of George Floyd, who died after being restrained by Minneapolis police officers on Memorial Day. ap — Minchillo MINNEAPOLIS — Protesters set police cars ablaze, smashed businesses’ windows and skirmished with baton-wielding officers in streets from Atlanta to Los Angeles, as anger over George Floyd’s death spread across the country. Authorities were bracing for more violence Saturday, with some calling in the National Guard to beef up overwhelmed forces. In Minneapolis, the city where Floyd died Monday after a white police officer pressed a knee into his neck and kept it there for more than eight minutes, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz fully mobilized the state’s National Guard and promised a massive show of force to help quell unrest that has grown increasingly destructive. “The situation in Minneapolis is no longer in any way about the murder of George Floyd,” Walz said. “It is about attacking civil society, instilling fear and disrupting our great cities.” On Friday alone, racially diverse crowds took to the streets in more than two dozen cities — from New York to Oakland, Calif., from Atlanta to Portland, Ore. — for protests that typically began peacefully before many descended into violence. At least two deaths were connected to the demonstrations; hundreds of people were arrested and police used batons, rubber bullets and pepper spray to push back crowds in some cities. Many departments reported officers were injured, while social media was awash in images of police using forceful tactics, throwing protesters to the ground, using bicycles as shields and trampling a protester while on horseback. Many protesters spoke of frustration that Floyd’s death was one more in a litany. It comes in the wake of the killing in Georgia of Ahmaud Arbery, who was shot after being pursued by two white men while running in their neighborhood, and in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic that has thrown millions out of work, killed more than 100,000 people in the U.S. and disproportionately affected black people. On Friday, the officer who held his knee to Floyd’s neck was arrested and charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter — but that appeared to provide little balm. Many protesters are demanding the arrests of the three other officers involved. Comments from President Donald Trump stoked the anger, when he fired off a series of tweets criticizing Minnesota’s response, ridiculing people who protested outside the White House and warning that if protesters breached the fence, “they would ... have been greeted with the most vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons, I have ever seen.” Leaders in many affected cities have voiced outrage over Floyd’s killing and offered sympathy for those who were protesting — but as unrest intensified, many spoke of the desperate need to protect their cities and said they would call in reinforcements, despite concerns that could lead to more heavy handed tactics. Minnesota has steadily increased the number of National Guardsmen it says it needs to contain the unrest, and has now called up 1,700. He is also considering a potential offer of military police, which the Pentagon put on alert. Georgia’s governor declared a state of emergency early Saturday to activate the state National Guard as violence flared in Atlanta. Portland, Ore., Mayor Ted Wheeler also declared an emergency and ordered a nighttime curfew for the city. The mayor of Cincinnati announced a curfew Saturday and Sunday following damage to about 50 businesses during protests there. The Guard was also on standby in the District of Columbia, where a crowd grew outside the White House and chanted curses at Trump. Some protesters tried to push through barriers set up by the U.S. Secret Service along Pennsylvania Avenue, and threw bottles and other objects at officers wearing riot gear, who responded with pepper spray. “I just feel like he’s just one of many names that we’ve had to create hashtags and T-shirts and campaigns for and I feel like nothing has changed,” district resident Abe Neri said of Floyd. “And so that’s why I’m out here. Yeah, when you say nothing, you’re taking the side of the oppressor.” A person was killed in downtown Detroit just before midnight after someone in an SUV fired shots into a crowd of protesters near the Greektown entertainment district, police said. And police in St. Louis were investigating the death of a protester who had climbed between two trailers of a FedEx truck and was killed when it drove away. Atlanta saw some of the most extreme unrest. While crews in that city worked to clean up glass and debris from rioting the night before, a large electronic billboard on Saturday morning still carried the message, “If you love Atlanta PLEASE GO HOME,” echoing the mayor’s pleas. National Guard members blocked anyone from approaching heavily damaged buildings, including the College Football Hall of Fame and nearby restaurants. “This is not in the spirit of Martin Luther King Jr.,” Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said. “You are disgracing the life of George Floyd and every other person who has been killed in this country.” Bottoms was flanked by King’s daughter, Bernice King, and rappers T.I. and Killer Mike. “We have to be better than burning down our own homes. Because if we lose Atlanta, what have we got?” said Killer Mike, crying as he spoke. Video posted to social media showed New York City officers using batons and shoving protesters down as they took people into custody and cleared streets. One video showed on officer slam a woman to the ground as he walked past her in the street. Demonstrators rocked a police van, set it ablaze, scrawled graffiti across its charred body and set it aflame again as officers retreated. “There will be a full review of what happened tonight,” Mayor Bill de Blasio tweeted, referring to the Brooklyn protest. “We don’t ever want to see another night like this.” Underscoring that Floyd’s killing is part of a pattern, the names of black people killed by police, including Eric Garner, who died on Staten Island in 2014, were on signs and in chants. “Our country has a sickness. We have to be out here,” said Brianna Petrisko, among those at lower Manhattan’s Foley Square, where most were wearing masks amid the coronavirus pandemic. “This is the only way we’re going to be heard.” In Houston and Dallas, Los Angeles and Oakland, Calif., protesters blocked interstates, but much of the ire in many cities was focused at police. In Portland, Ore., protesters lit a fire inside police headquarters. Protesters in Houston, where Floyd grew up, included 19-year-old Jimmy Ohaz from the nearby city of Richmond, Texas: “My question is how many more, how many more? I just want to live in a future where we all live in harmony and we’re not oppressed.”",0.0

Still, the incidents provoked concern from a range of advocacy groups.""Journalists have a clear First Amendment right to cover public events,"" Freedom of the Press Foundation advocacy director Parker Higgins said in a statement.CNN reporter describes arrest, power of capturing something on videoIn Louisville, Kentucky, where protesters have been calling for accountability for a black woman who was fatally shot by police in March, reporters for WLKY were targeted by protesters on Friday night. A WLKY news vehicle was destroyed and a videojournalist ""was attacked so badly he had to go to the ER,"" anchor Julie Dolan said on Twitter.An officer there also fired what appeared to be pepper balls at a reporter for WAVE 3 News. The incident was broadcast live on the air. ""Who are they aiming that at?"" the anchor asked. ""At us,"" the reporter replied.The reporter, Kaitlin Rust, and her cameraman were ""courageously and lawfully"" covering the news when they were targeted, the station said in a statement. ""There is simply no justification for the Louisville police to wantonly open fire, even with pepper balls, on any journalists under any circumstances.""Louisville Metro Police Special Advisor Jessie Halladay issued an apology to Rust. Halladay said she had reviewed the video and said the incident was not something that should have occurred if Rust was singled out as a reporter.Many TV networks are dispatching private security guards to support journalists who are in the field at protests.""These situations could have been much worse had it not been for security,"" Dolan said.Security guards were involved when a Fox News crew was harassed and chased out of Lafayette Park, one block from the White House, on Friday night. Videos of the incident showed protesters cursing at Fox and criticizing right-wing media.Correspondent Leland Vittert, cameraman Christian Galdabini and two security guards left the park as the crowd grew more and more hostile. According to Fox, ""Vittert and the crew were punched and hit with projectiles as they fled, and a Fox News camera was broken when a member of the mob tried to grab it.""Journalists from rival outlets supported the Fox crew and condemned the violence. CNN anchor Jake Tapper called it an ""unacceptable assault on freedom of the press.""CBS correspondent Ed O'Keefe wrote on Twitter, ""Whether it's police officers or everyday Americans — keep your hands, weapons and handcuffs off of *any* journalist exercising their First Amendment right to report the news.

What ""we think happened is I took a rubber bullet to the face,"" she wrote. ""It exploded my eyeball, which has now been patched back together but who knows if it'll need more surgery. My vision is gone no matter what it winds up looking like scar wise.""In Denver, a crew from KMGH TV reported being hit with paintballs and tear gas.In Phoenix, reporter Briana Whitney was accosted by a protester while she was live on the air.""I was intentionally tackled by this man while I was on air trying to report what was happening during the protest at Phoenix PD headquarters,"" she said at the end of the night. ""I feel violated, and this was terrifying.""In Las Vegas, two photojournalists on assignment to cover protests were taken into police custody on Friday night.Photographer Bridget Bennett told CNN Business that she was detained along with another photojournalist at the protest location. ""I'm a freelance photojournalist and was working on assignment for AFP. I was released this morning,"" Bennett said. She declined further comment.Ellen Schmidt, a staff photojournalist at the Las Vegas Review-Journal, was also arrested.Review-Journal executive editor Glenn Cook said in an email message, ""it is appalling that Las Vegas police officers, who have nothing to do with what happened in Minnesota, would so forcefully take into custody two people who were obviously working photojournalists and posed no threat to law enforcement or public safety. They never should have been touched, let alone arrested and then booked into jail.""On Saturday morning, the recovery efforts began. At CNN Center, the network's flagship building in Atlanta, protesters' graffiti on the CNN logo was removed. An internal memo reassured staffers that everyone at the building was safe.UN secretary general António Guterres was moved to post a message defending the rights of the press.""When journalists are attacked, societies are attacked,"" he tweeted Saturday morning.

1621304767,2020-05-30 13:04:50,Judge allows Maine&rsquo;s quarantine on out-of-staters to stand,https://www.seacoastonline.com/news/20200530/judge-allows-mainersquos-quarantine-on-out-of-staters-to-stand?rssfeed=true,en,False,,662028,Portsmouth Herald,http://www.seacoastonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/section?Category=NEWS09,"PORTLAND, Maine — A federal judge denied a motion in a lawsuit by some Maine campground operators who believe a state quarantine order for out-of-state visitors is unconstitutional. The move came Friday, hours after the U.S. Department of Justice said it filed court papers in support of campground operators. The campgrounds sued in federal court saying they believe the rule treats Maine residents more favorably than out-of-state residents, and that is hurting them economically. U.S. District Judge Lance Walker on Friday denied a motion for a preliminary injunction, allowing the rule to stand while the lawsuit proceeds, the Portland Press Herald reported. Gov. Janet Mills, a Democrat, said the quarantine is ""a proven tool to prevent the spread of this deadly disease"" and said the Justice Department is ""making a concerted effort to undermine the health of the people of Maine."" Mills said Saturday restaurants in Androscoggin, Cumberland and York counties that she told to delay opening can sell their excess food to prisons. Mills plans to start the second phase of the state's reopening on June 1 but said restaurants in those counties won't be able to open that day. She said the Maine Department of Corrections commissioner has agreed to purchase excess food from restaurants in those areas, WMTE reported. On Saturday, Maine reported four more deaths from COVID-19 for a total of 89. The state also reported 56 new coronavirus cases, raising its total to 2,282 New Hampshire The head of a group that represents New Hampshire nursing homes is begging the public to wear face coverings to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. Brendan Williams, president of the New Hampshire Health Care Association, says he supports Nashua's ordinance requiring face masks in public. ""Considerable sacrifice was demanded of Americans in winning World War II. Are we now unwilling to wear masks, or socially distance, to save those who lived through World War II?"" he said in a statement. Department of Health and Human Services Commissioner Lori Shibinette said May 6 that all nursing home residents would be tested within two weeks. On Friday, she said about 95% had been tested. Staff testing was expected to be completed over the weekend. New Hampshire on Saturday announced four additional COVID-19-related deaths. All were age 60 or older and all were in Hillsborough County. The state also announced 55 new positive test results for COVID-19, bringing the state’s total to 4,545. There were nine new hospitalized cases, keeping the state’s rate of hospitalization at 10%. Of the cases on Saturday with complete information, four were age 18 or younger. The new cases live in Hillsborough County other than Manchester and Nashua (10), Merrimack (7), Rockingham (7), Belknap (2), Carroll (1), Grafton (1), and Strafford (1) counties, and in Manchester (13) and Nashua (12). Through Saturday, the state has conducted 70,280 detection tests and 11,468 antibody tests. Massachusetts City officials in Boston are concerned many Asian American residents may not be getting tested for the new coronavirus. Boston's Chinatown zip code, where half the residents are of Asian descent, is one of city neighborhoods with the lowest percentage of positive coronavirus cases, Marty Martinez, the city's chief of Health and Human Services told the Boston Globe. Only 13% of those tested were positive, compared to the citywide cumulative percentage of 26%. Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders make up just less than 10% of Boston's population but account for only 4% of confirmed COVID-19 cases and 6% of deaths, according the newspaper. At the same time, black residents, who comprise 25% of the city's population, account for 38% of COVID-19 infections and 35% of deaths, in cases where the race and ethnicity is known. Latinos make up nearly 20% of the Boston population and account for 25% of cases and 11% of deaths. Paul Watanabe, a political science professor and director of the Institute for Asian American Studies at the University of Massachusetts Boston who is on the mayor's COVID-19 Health Inequities Task Force, thinks the numbers, though incomplete, show a low level of testing among Boston's Asian American population. The percentage of deaths may indicate those Asian Americans with COVID-19 are getting tested late. ""It suggests people might be contracting the illness, unknown that they got it, and going straight to death... without having their situation diagnosed through a positive test or being dealt with, more importantly,"" Watanabe said. Connecticut Health care workers rallied in New London Saturday to protest what they called a shortage of personal protective equipment and pay tribute to a nurse's aide who died earlier this month after contracting the coronavirus. Gov. Ned Lamont, Lt. Gov. Susan Bysiewicz and U.S. Rep. Joe Courtney, D-Conn., joined workers at Lawrence + Memorial Hospital and the Visiting Nurses Association of Southeastern Connecticut for the rally. Union leaders said nurses, aides and other health care workers are risking their lives caring for COVID-19 patients while lacking sufficient protective gear to keep them safe. People at the rally remembered Elva Graveline, a 52-year-old nurse's aide at Lawrence + Memorial who contracted the coronavirus and died May 19. Graveline's daughter thanked hospital workers for caring for her mother, according to the AFT Connecticut labor union. As of Friday, nearly 41,800 people in Connecticut tested positive for the virus and nearly 3,900 have died, including about 2,400 nursing home residents.",0.0
1621304759,2020-05-30 18:33:49,"Manchester police: Man with Trump flag on truck drives by protesters, pulls gun, gets arrested",https://www.seacoastonline.com/news/20200530/manchester-police-man-with-trump-flag-on-truck-drives-by-protesters-pulls-gun-gets-arrested?rssfeed=true,en,False,,662028,Portsmouth Herald,http://www.seacoastonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/section?Category=NEWS09,"MANCHESTER, NH – A peaceful sit-in by Black Lives Matters protesters outside the Manchester Police Department Saturday was interrupted when a truck displaying a large Trump flag drove by the group at about 1:30 p.m. A confrontation between the truck’s driver and the group ended with a gun threat and two arrests. The driver of the truck, Scott Kimball, 43, and passenger, his son, Mark Kimball, 19, were arrested and charged with felony riot and felony criminal threatening, according to police. As of 5 p.m., there was still ""activity"" outside the police station, said Lt. Shawn McCabe, and the building remained closed to visitors for the ""safety of officers and employees."" Police declined to say where the two men were from. Stacy Harrison, a photographer on assignment for Manchester Ink Link, was at the scene when it unfolded. She said a small group of protesters gathered at the police station at 405 Valley St. after the Elm Street demonstration. It was an effort to initiate a dialog with law enforcement, according to organizers of the earlier march, which drew an estimated 1,000 people. The march itself was peaceful and organizers even had two people offering participants free face masks (cognizant of social distancing in the age of COVID-19) in baskets at the end of ski poles. At the police station, however, things turned ugly when a young man saw a black pickup truck with a huge Trump flag in its bed heading up Valley Street, from Elm Street, and nearing the police station. Harrison said the protester, who she described as a black man in his late teens or early 20s, started swearing. She turned to see what he was looking at and saw the truck. The driver and passenger were both white males. ""Every nasty possible thing you can think he was swearing at the truck,"" she said. Harrison said as the truck crawled by her and her 15-year-old daughter, the occupants of the truck – a driver and passenger – began hurling insults at the young man. The young man responded with his own diatribe. She thought those in the truck were going to yell whatever they were going to yell and then keep going but then the young man went toward the truck and a heated exchange took place. ""They were yelling the ""N"" word,"" she said. ""They were screaming at each other and I heard the word ""Trump"" a few times."" By then other people saw what was happening and headed toward the truck as well. ""They all sort of swarmed like a bunch of bees towards the truck,"" she said. The driver pulled the truck over into the parking lot outside Associated Concrete Coatings and the yelling continued. Someone threw something that was white – Harrison thought it might be a piece of paper, a bottle cap or a water bottle – which bounced off the driver’s window. Then she saw something black being waved around by someone in the truck and heard shouts of, ""He’s got a gun. He’s got a gun."" Officers immediately surrounded the truck. Initially, she said there were 20 to 25 officers but more streamed out of the station. She estimated there were about 60 officers in the street by the time two men were taken into custody. Melissa Bernardin, a longtime resident of Concord, was also at police headquarters when the violence erupted. She had come to Manchester Saturday morning to support the cause, and was part of the group that moved from Elm Street to police headquarters. ""By the time I arrived the situation had gone from tense to a positive dialogue with police,"" Bernardin said. At some point she said she noticed a pick-up truck drive slowly by the police station displaying a large Trump flag. Several minutes later she saw the same truck coming back from the other direction. She regarded the people in the truck as instigators. ""Some of the protesters who also saw the truck started yelling at the truck. I recall seeing a protester throw a water bottle at the truck. At that point I started running toward the truck to try and deescalate the situation because I know it wasn’t going to turn into anything good,"" Bernardin said. ""I saw the driver of the truck jump out with a gun at which point I ran away to seek shelter behind a concrete lamp post, but I heard the driver cocked and pointed the gun at the crowd. And then I heard that the passenger got out and drew his gun out of his holster but that he didn’t point it at anyone."" Although Manchester is far removed from Minneapolis, she suspects people came out in solidarity with the Black Life Matters movement here for the same reason she did. ""The issue of racism and police brutality in our country is one that touches all communities, and while there may be different levels of racism and police brutality against people of color in different communities, we all feel every human deserves to be treated with dignity,"" Bernardin says. ""We feel solidarity with individuals who are killed at the hands of police."" She says she considers herself a white ally of the Black Lives Matter movement. ""I’ve personally come to an understanding of how prevalent racism and violence against people of color is in our society through reading and learning and following the news, and the more you follow it the more heartbreaking it is,"" Bernardin said. ""I can’t see any way not to join a protest in solidarity with those being directly affected by police brutality."" She said she’s thankful the day’s events were mostly peaceful. ""I’m thankful the men who jumped out of the truck with guns didn’t kill anyone. It’s terrifying to me that a group of people who show up in public to demonstrate because they care about the intrinsic value of human life could have to face down such a terrifying threat."" In a news release, police agreed that the Black Lives Matter demonstration earlier in the day was peaceful and those in attendance were respectful of each other and police. No one was arrested. After the march, 100 people gathered outside the station when about 1:30 p.m. the confrontation occurred Police confirmed one of the truck’s occupants pulled out a gun – they did not say whether it was the passenger or driver – but both were taken into custody. They were being booked Saturday afternoon. Police said their identities will be released later. People remained outside the station after the arrests were made. Police Chief Carlo Capano and Assistant Chief Ryan Grant talked with protesters following the arrests. In one video recording, posted online by Matthew Lawrence, Capano is heard talking about what happened to George Floyd, the Minneapolis man who died after Officer Derek Chauvin held his foot on Floyd’s neck for nine minutes. Chauvin is charged with third-degree murder. ""[What happened to George Floyd] disgusts me and every police officer standing behind me,"" Capano said. ""Nobody hates a bad cop more than a good cop."" As of 2:30 p.m., some people were still outside the police station. Police said while the department is open, the building is closed ""for the safety of our officers and employees,"" according to the news release issued by Public Information Officer Heather Hamel.

1621304757,2020-05-30 18:39:49,"1,000 rally in Manchester for Black Lives Matter march",https://www.seacoastonline.com/news/20200530/1000-rally-in-manchester-for-black-lives-matter-march?rssfeed=true,en,False,,662028,Portsmouth Herald,http://www.seacoastonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/section?Category=NEWS09,"MANCHESTER — More than 1,000 people took to the streets Saturday morning as part of a peaceful protest against the killings of unarmed black men around the country. “We plan to stand in solidarity with the people who are assassinated in our country,” said Tyrell Whitted, a Manchester resident and one of the march organizers with Black Lives Matter. The nation is being rocked by the May 25 death of George Floyd in Minneapolis seemingly at the hands of police, and the resulting protests – and in some cases riots. Four Minneapolis police officers involved in the arrest have been fired. One of them, Derek Chauvin was arrested and charged Friday with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter in Floyd’s death. “I believe that when justice isn’t served the people are going to react,” Whitted said. People started gathering at Veteran’s Memorial Park Saturday morning ahead of the march, ready with signs, and the ever-present face masks to help curb the spread of COVID-19. By and large, the marchers want to see change following the death of Floyd and others, including another recent victim, Ahmaud Arbery. In February, Arbery, an African-American, was chased down by two white men, a father and son, and shot to death. The killing took place in February, but no arrests were made until after a video of the incident leaked to the press months later. “I’m so outraged I can’t even articulate my anger,” said Carla Giorgi or Manchester. Giorgi, a white woman raising an African American son, said she fears for her child’s life as he grows up in America, given the violence African Americans are subject to. Giorgi’s friend, Helena Laquinta, of Nashua, said white people have a responsibility to minorities to end the racial injustices that are killing them. “We built this systemic racism, so we have to be the ones who change it,” Laquinta said. India Barrows, a Manchester resident and an African American, said the country needs to stop harming minorities. The violence and discrimination minorities face from civil authorities in New Hampshire is a long-standing problem, she said. “This has been happening since I was 18,” Barrows said. James McKim, president of the Manchester chapter of the NAACP, attended the march to support the Black Lives Matter movement. “We have to talk about the scourge of racism and discrimination in this country,” McKim said. McKim said that while race relations in New Hampshire are good overall, racism is real and it does lasting harm. He’s currently dealing with officials involved in Albany where two New Hampshire State Troopers were caught on video smashing into the car of Jean Saint Preux, an African American, and pulling him out of his vehicle by his dreadlocks. McKim said he’s spoken with police and FBI agents about that case. McKim said the problem stems from people not seeing the full human dignity in other people, and then treating them as less than human. “Many people don’t see others as individuals,” McKim said. Minneapolis Police Officer Derek Chauvin was captured on video with his knee on Floyd’s neck during an arrest as Floyd can be heard begging for air. Floyd later died and it took authorities in Minneapolis days to arrest Chauvin and charge him with third-degree murder. Saturday’s march had protesters headed down Elm Street past City Hall chanting “No Justice, No Peace,” “Black Lives Matter,” and “Hands Up, Don’t Shoot,” among other refrains. The march and rally afterward were peaceful, with Manchester police providing traffic control to clear the road for marchers. Gov. Chris Sununu issued the following statement following the rally: “This morning I called the organizers ahead of the George Floyd March in Manchester to let them know the State of New Hampshire stands with them in their calls for justice,” said Gov. Chris Sununu. “This important conversation must continue and we must constructively work together as a nation to ensure there is change.” Manchester Police Chief Carl Capano is seen on the video engaging with the protesters and talking about Floyd’s death. “[What happened to George Floyd] disgusts me and every police officer standing behind me,” Capano said. “Nobody hates a bad cop more than a good cop.”",0.0

Initially, she said there were 20 to 25 officers but more streamed out of the station. She estimated there were about 60 officers in the street by the time two men were taken into custody. Melissa Bernardin, a longtime resident of Concord, was also at police headquarters when the violence erupted. She had come to Manchester Saturday morning to support the cause, and was part of the group that moved from Elm Street to police headquarters. ""By the time I arrived the situation had gone from tense to a positive dialogue with police,"" Bernardin said. At some point she said she noticed a pick-up truck drive slowly by the police station displaying a large Trump flag. Several minutes later she saw the same truck coming back from the other direction. She regarded the people in the truck as instigators. ""Some of the protesters who also saw the truck started yelling at the truck. I recall seeing a protester throw a water bottle at the truck. At that point I started running toward the truck to try and deescalate the situation because I know it wasn’t going to turn into anything good,"" Bernardin said. ""I saw the driver of the truck jump out with a gun at which point I ran away to seek shelter behind a concrete lamp post, but I heard the driver cocked and pointed the gun at the crowd. And then I heard that the passenger got out and drew his gun out of his holster but that he didn’t point it at anyone."" Although Manchester is far removed from Minneapolis, she suspects people came out in solidarity with the Black Life Matters movement here for the same reason she did. ""The issue of racism and police brutality in our country is one that touches all communities, and while there may be different levels of racism and police brutality against people of color in different communities, we all feel every human deserves to be treated with dignity,"" Bernardin says. ""We feel solidarity with individuals who are killed at the hands of police."" She says she considers herself a white ally of the Black Lives Matter movement. ""I’ve personally come to an understanding of how prevalent racism and violence against people of color is in our society through reading and learning and following the news, and the more you follow it the more heartbreaking it is,"" Bernardin said. ""I can’t see any way not to join a protest in solidarity with those being directly affected by police brutality."" She said she’s thankful the day’s events were mostly peaceful. ""I’m thankful the men who jumped out of the truck with guns didn’t kill anyone. It’s terrifying to me that a group of people who show up in public to demonstrate because they care about the intrinsic value of human life could have to face down such a terrifying threat."" In a news release, police agreed that the Black Lives Matter demonstration earlier in the day was peaceful and those in attendance were respectful of each other and police. No one was arrested. After the march, 100 people gathered outside the station when about 1:30 p.m. the confrontation occurred Police confirmed one of the truck’s occupants pulled out a gun – they did not say whether it was the passenger or driver – but both were taken into custody. They were being booked Saturday afternoon. Police said their identities will be released later. People remained outside the station after the arrests were made. Police Chief Carlo Capano and Assistant Chief Ryan Grant talked with protesters following the arrests. In one video recording, posted online by Matthew Lawrence, Capano is heard talking about what happened to George Floyd, the Minneapolis man who died after Officer Derek Chauvin held his foot on Floyd’s neck for nine minutes. Chauvin is charged with third-degree murder. ""[What happened to George Floyd] disgusts me and every police officer standing behind me,"" Capano said. ""Nobody hates a bad cop more than a good cop."" As of 2:30 p.m., some people were still outside the police station.

1621304744,2020-05-30 18:39:49,"1,000 rally in Manchester for Black Lives Matter march",https://www.seacoastonline.com/news/20200530/1000-rally-in-manchester-for-black-lives-matter-march?rssfeed=true,en,False,,662008,Exeter News Letter,http://www.seacoastonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/section?Category=NEWS11,"MANCHESTER — More than 1,000 people took to the streets Saturday morning as part of a peaceful protest against the killings of unarmed black men around the country. “We plan to stand in solidarity with the people who are assassinated in our country,” said Tyrell Whitted, a Manchester resident and one of the march organizers with Black Lives Matter. The nation is being rocked by the May 25 death of George Floyd in Minneapolis seemingly at the hands of police, and the resulting protests – and in some cases riots. Four Minneapolis police officers involved in the arrest have been fired. One of them, Derek Chauvin was arrested and charged Friday with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter in Floyd’s death. “I believe that when justice isn’t served the people are going to react,” Whitted said. People started gathering at Veteran’s Memorial Park Saturday morning ahead of the march, ready with signs, and the ever-present face masks to help curb the spread of COVID-19. By and large, the marchers want to see change following the death of Floyd and others, including another recent victim, Ahmaud Arbery. In February, Arbery, an African-American, was chased down by two white men, a father and son, and shot to death. The killing took place in February, but no arrests were made until after a video of the incident leaked to the press months later. “I’m so outraged I can’t even articulate my anger,” said Carla Giorgi or Manchester. Giorgi, a white woman raising an African American son, said she fears for her child’s life as he grows up in America, given the violence African Americans are subject to. Giorgi’s friend, Helena Laquinta, of Nashua, said white people have a responsibility to minorities to end the racial injustices that are killing them. “We built this systemic racism, so we have to be the ones who change it,” Laquinta said. India Barrows, a Manchester resident and an African American, said the country needs to stop harming minorities. The violence and discrimination minorities face from civil authorities in New Hampshire is a long-standing problem, she said. “This has been happening since I was 18,” Barrows said. James McKim, president of the Manchester chapter of the NAACP, attended the march to support the Black Lives Matter movement. “We have to talk about the scourge of racism and discrimination in this country,” McKim said. McKim said that while race relations in New Hampshire are good overall, racism is real and it does lasting harm. He’s currently dealing with officials involved in Albany where two New Hampshire State Troopers were caught on video smashing into the car of Jean Saint Preux, an African American, and pulling him out of his vehicle by his dreadlocks. McKim said he’s spoken with police and FBI agents about that case. McKim said the problem stems from people not seeing the full human dignity in other people, and then treating them as less than human. “Many people don’t see others as individuals,” McKim said. Minneapolis Police Officer Derek Chauvin was captured on video with his knee on Floyd’s neck during an arrest as Floyd can be heard begging for air. Floyd later died and it took authorities in Minneapolis days to arrest Chauvin and charge him with third-degree murder. Saturday’s march had protesters headed down Elm Street past City Hall chanting “No Justice, No Peace,” “Black Lives Matter,” and “Hands Up, Don’t Shoot,” among other refrains. The march and rally afterward were peaceful, with Manchester police providing traffic control to clear the road for marchers. Gov. Chris Sununu issued the following statement following the rally: “This morning I called the organizers ahead of the George Floyd March in Manchester to let them know the State of New Hampshire stands with them in their calls for justice,” said Gov. Chris Sununu. “This important conversation must continue and we must constructively work together as a nation to ensure there is change.” Manchester Police Chief Carl Capano is seen on the video engaging with the protesters and talking about Floyd’s death. “[What happened to George Floyd] disgusts me and every police officer standing behind me,” Capano said. “Nobody hates a bad cop more than a good cop.”",0.0

The move came Friday, hours after the U.S. Department of Justice said it filed court papers in support of campground operators. The campgrounds sued in federal court saying they believe the rule treats Maine residents more favorably than out-of-state residents, and that is hurting them economically. U.S. District Judge Lance Walker on Friday denied a motion for a preliminary injunction, allowing the rule to stand while the lawsuit proceeds, the Portland Press Herald reported. Gov. Janet Mills, a Democrat, said the quarantine is ""a proven tool to prevent the spread of this deadly disease"" and said the Justice Department is ""making a concerted effort to undermine the health of the people of Maine."" Mills said Saturday restaurants in Androscoggin, Cumberland and York counties that she told to delay opening can sell their excess food to prisons. Mills plans to start the second phase of the state's reopening on June 1 but said restaurants in those counties won't be able to open that day. She said the Maine Department of Corrections commissioner has agreed to purchase excess food from restaurants in those areas, WMTE reported. On Saturday, Maine reported four more deaths from COVID-19 for a total of 89. The state also reported 56 new coronavirus cases, raising its total to 2,282 New Hampshire The head of a group that represents New Hampshire nursing homes is begging the public to wear face coverings to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. Brendan Williams, president of the New Hampshire Health Care Association, says he supports Nashua's ordinance requiring face masks in public. ""Considerable sacrifice was demanded of Americans in winning World War II. Are we now unwilling to wear masks, or socially distance, to save those who lived through World War II?"" he said in a statement. Department of Health and Human Services Commissioner Lori Shibinette said May 6 that all nursing home residents would be tested within two weeks. On Friday, she said about 95% had been tested. Staff testing was expected to be completed over the weekend. New Hampshire on Saturday announced four additional COVID-19-related deaths. All were age 60 or older and all were in Hillsborough County. The state also announced 55 new positive test results for COVID-19, bringing the state’s total to 4,545. There were nine new hospitalized cases, keeping the state’s rate of hospitalization at 10%. Of the cases on Saturday with complete information, four were age 18 or younger. The new cases live in Hillsborough County other than Manchester and Nashua (10), Merrimack (7), Rockingham (7), Belknap (2), Carroll (1), Grafton (1), and Strafford (1) counties, and in Manchester (13) and Nashua (12). Through Saturday, the state has conducted 70,280 detection tests and 11,468 antibody tests. Massachusetts City officials in Boston are concerned many Asian American residents may not be getting tested for the new coronavirus. Boston's Chinatown zip code, where half the residents are of Asian descent, is one of city neighborhoods with the lowest percentage of positive coronavirus cases, Marty Martinez, the city's chief of Health and Human Services told the Boston Globe. Only 13% of those tested were positive, compared to the citywide cumulative percentage of 26%. Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders make up just less than 10% of Boston's population but account for only 4% of confirmed COVID-19 cases and 6% of deaths, according the newspaper. At the same time, black residents, who comprise 25% of the city's population, account for 38% of COVID-19 infections and 35% of deaths, in cases where the race and ethnicity is known. Latinos make up nearly 20% of the Boston population and account for 25% of cases and 11% of deaths. Paul Watanabe, a political science professor and director of the Institute for Asian American Studies at the University of Massachusetts Boston who is on the mayor's COVID-19 Health Inequities Task Force, thinks the numbers, though incomplete, show a low level of testing among Boston's Asian American population. The percentage of deaths may indicate those Asian Americans with COVID-19 are getting tested late. ""It suggests people might be contracting the illness, unknown that they got it, and going straight to death... without having their situation diagnosed through a positive test or being dealt with, more importantly,"" Watanabe said. Connecticut Health care workers rallied in New London Saturday to protest what they called a shortage of personal protective equipment and pay tribute to a nurse's aide who died earlier this month after contracting the coronavirus. Gov. Ned Lamont, Lt. Gov. Susan Bysiewicz and U.S. Rep. Joe Courtney, D-Conn., joined workers at Lawrence + Memorial Hospital and the Visiting Nurses Association of Southeastern Connecticut for the rally. Union leaders said nurses, aides and other health care workers are risking their lives caring for COVID-19 patients while lacking sufficient protective gear to keep them safe. People at the rally remembered Elva Graveline, a 52-year-old nurse's aide at Lawrence + Memorial who contracted the coronavirus and died May 19. Graveline's daughter thanked hospital workers for caring for her mother, according to the AFT Connecticut labor union. As of Friday, nearly 41,800 people in Connecticut tested positive for the virus and nearly 3,900 have died, including about 2,400 nursing home residents.",0.0

The driver of the truck, Scott Kimball, 43, and passenger, his son, Mark Kimball, 19, were arrested and charged with felony riot and felony criminal threatening, according to police. As of 5 p.m., there was still ""activity"" outside the police station, said Lt. Shawn McCabe, and the building remained closed to visitors for the ""safety of officers and employees."" Police declined to say where the two men were from. Stacy Harrison, a photographer on assignment for Manchester Ink Link, was at the scene when it unfolded. She said a small group of protesters gathered at the police station at 405 Valley St. after the Elm Street demonstration. It was an effort to initiate a dialog with law enforcement, according to organizers of the earlier march, which drew an estimated 1,000 people. The march itself was peaceful and organizers even had two people offering participants free face masks (cognizant of social distancing in the age of COVID-19) in baskets at the end of ski poles. At the police station, however, things turned ugly when a young man saw a black pickup truck with a huge Trump flag in its bed heading up Valley Street, from Elm Street, and nearing the police station. Harrison said the protester, who she described as a black man in his late teens or early 20s, started swearing. She turned to see what he was looking at and saw the truck. The driver and passenger were both white males. ""Every nasty possible thing you can think he was swearing at the truck,"" she said. Harrison said as the truck crawled by her and her 15-year-old daughter, the occupants of the truck – a driver and passenger – began hurling insults at the young man. The young man responded with his own diatribe. She thought those in the truck were going to yell whatever they were going to yell and then keep going but then the young man went toward the truck and a heated exchange took place. ""They were yelling the ""N"" word,"" she said. ""They were screaming at each other and I heard the word ""Trump"" a few times."" By then other people saw what was happening and headed toward the truck as well. ""They all sort of swarmed like a bunch of bees towards the truck,"" she said. The driver pulled the truck over into the parking lot outside Associated Concrete Coatings and the yelling continued. Someone threw something that was white – Harrison thought it might be a piece of paper, a bottle cap or a water bottle – which bounced off the driver’s window.

The nation is being rocked by the May 25 death of George Floyd in Minneapolis seemingly at the hands of police, and the resulting protests – and in some cases riots. Four Minneapolis police officers involved in the arrest have been fired. One of them, Derek Chauvin was arrested and charged Friday with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter in Floyd’s death. “I believe that when justice isn’t served the people are going to react,” Whitted said. People started gathering at Veteran’s Memorial Park Saturday morning ahead of the march, ready with signs, and the ever-present face masks to help curb the spread of COVID-19. By and large, the marchers want to see change following the death of Floyd and others, including another recent victim, Ahmaud Arbery. In February, Arbery, an African-American, was chased down by two white men, a father and son, and shot to death. The killing took place in February, but no arrests were made until after a video of the incident leaked to the press months later. “I’m so outraged I can’t even articulate my anger,” said Carla Giorgi or Manchester. Giorgi, a white woman raising an African American son, said she fears for her child’s life as he grows up in America, given the violence African Americans are subject to. Giorgi’s friend, Helena Laquinta, of Nashua, said white people have a responsibility to minorities to end the racial injustices that are killing them. “We built this systemic racism, so we have to be the ones who change it,” Laquinta said. India Barrows, a Manchester resident and an African American, said the country needs to stop harming minorities. The violence and discrimination minorities face from civil authorities in New Hampshire is a long-standing problem, she said. “This has been happening since I was 18,” Barrows said. James McKim, president of the Manchester chapter of the NAACP, attended the march to support the Black Lives Matter movement. “We have to talk about the scourge of racism and discrimination in this country,” McKim said. McKim said that while race relations in New Hampshire are good overall, racism is real and it does lasting harm. He’s currently dealing with officials involved in Albany where two New Hampshire State Troopers were caught on video smashing into the car of Jean Saint Preux, an African American, and pulling him out of his vehicle by his dreadlocks. McKim said he’s spoken with police and FBI agents about that case. McKim said the problem stems from people not seeing the full human dignity in other people, and then treating them as less than human. “Many people don’t see others as individuals,” McKim said. Minneapolis Police Officer Derek Chauvin was captured on video with his knee on Floyd’s neck during an arrest as Floyd can be heard begging for air. Floyd later died and it took authorities in Minneapolis days to arrest Chauvin and charge him with third-degree murder. Saturday’s march had protesters headed down Elm Street past City Hall chanting “No Justice, No Peace,” “Black Lives Matter,” and “Hands Up, Don’t Shoot,” among other refrains. The march and rally afterward were peaceful, with Manchester police providing traffic control to clear the road for marchers. Gov. Chris Sununu issued the following statement following the rally: “This morning I called the organizers ahead of the George Floyd March in Manchester to let them know the State of New Hampshire stands with them in their calls for justice,” said Gov. Chris Sununu. “This important conversation must continue and we must constructively work together as a nation to ensure there is change.” Manchester Police Chief Carl Capano is seen on the video engaging with the protesters and talking about Floyd’s death. “[What happened to George Floyd] disgusts me and every police officer standing behind me,” Capano said. “Nobody hates a bad cop more than a good cop.”",0.0

1621314952,2020-05-30 13:04:54,Judge allows Maine&rsquo;s quarantine on out-of-staters to stand,https://www.fosters.com/news/20200530/judge-allows-mainersquos-quarantine-on-out-of-staters-to-stand?rssfeed=true,en,False,,82445,fosters.com,http://www.fosters.com/#spider,"PORTLAND, Maine — A federal judge denied a motion in a lawsuit by some Maine campground operators who believe a state quarantine order for out-of-state visitors is unconstitutional. The move came Friday, hours after the U.S. Department of Justice said it filed court papers in support of campground operators. The campgrounds sued in federal court saying they believe the rule treats Maine residents more favorably than out-of-state residents, and that is hurting them economically. U.S. District Judge Lance Walker on Friday denied a motion for a preliminary injunction, allowing the rule to stand while the lawsuit proceeds, the Portland Press Herald reported. Gov. Janet Mills, a Democrat, said the quarantine is ""a proven tool to prevent the spread of this deadly disease"" and said the Justice Department is ""making a concerted effort to undermine the health of the people of Maine."" Mills said Saturday restaurants in Androscoggin, Cumberland and York counties that she told to delay opening can sell their excess food to prisons. Mills plans to start the second phase of the state's reopening on June 1 but said restaurants in those counties won't be able to open that day. She said the Maine Department of Corrections commissioner has agreed to purchase excess food from restaurants in those areas, WMTE reported. On Saturday, Maine reported four more deaths from COVID-19 for a total of 89. The state also reported 56 new coronavirus cases, raising its total to 2,282 New Hampshire The head of a group that represents New Hampshire nursing homes is begging the public to wear face coverings to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. Brendan Williams, president of the New Hampshire Health Care Association, says he supports Nashua's ordinance requiring face masks in public. ""Considerable sacrifice was demanded of Americans in winning World War II. Are we now unwilling to wear masks, or socially distance, to save those who lived through World War II?"" he said in a statement. Department of Health and Human Services Commissioner Lori Shibinette said May 6 that all nursing home residents would be tested within two weeks. On Friday, she said about 95% had been tested. Staff testing was expected to be completed over the weekend. New Hampshire on Saturday announced four additional COVID-19-related deaths. All were age 60 or older and all were in Hillsborough County. The state also announced 55 new positive test results for COVID-19, bringing the state’s total to 4,545. There were nine new hospitalized cases, keeping the state’s rate of hospitalization at 10%. Of the cases on Saturday with complete information, four were age 18 or younger. The new cases live in Hillsborough County other than Manchester and Nashua (10), Merrimack (7), Rockingham (7), Belknap (2), Carroll (1), Grafton (1), and Strafford (1) counties, and in Manchester (13) and Nashua (12). Through Saturday, the state has conducted 70,280 detection tests and 11,468 antibody tests. Massachusetts City officials in Boston are concerned many Asian American residents may not be getting tested for the new coronavirus. Boston's Chinatown zip code, where half the residents are of Asian descent, is one of city neighborhoods with the lowest percentage of positive coronavirus cases, Marty Martinez, the city's chief of Health and Human Services told the Boston Globe. Only 13% of those tested were positive, compared to the citywide cumulative percentage of 26%. Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders make up just less than 10% of Boston's population but account for only 4% of confirmed COVID-19 cases and 6% of deaths, according the newspaper. At the same time, black residents, who comprise 25% of the city's population, account for 38% of COVID-19 infections and 35% of deaths, in cases where the race and ethnicity is known. Latinos make up nearly 20% of the Boston population and account for 25% of cases and 11% of deaths. Paul Watanabe, a political science professor and director of the Institute for Asian American Studies at the University of Massachusetts Boston who is on the mayor's COVID-19 Health Inequities Task Force, thinks the numbers, though incomplete, show a low level of testing among Boston's Asian American population. The percentage of deaths may indicate those Asian Americans with COVID-19 are getting tested late. ""It suggests people might be contracting the illness, unknown that they got it, and going straight to death... without having their situation diagnosed through a positive test or being dealt with, more importantly,"" Watanabe said. Connecticut Health care workers rallied in New London Saturday to protest what they called a shortage of personal protective equipment and pay tribute to a nurse's aide who died earlier this month after contracting the coronavirus. Gov. Ned Lamont, Lt. Gov. Susan Bysiewicz and U.S. Rep. Joe Courtney, D-Conn., joined workers at Lawrence + Memorial Hospital and the Visiting Nurses Association of Southeastern Connecticut for the rally. Union leaders said nurses, aides and other health care workers are risking their lives caring for COVID-19 patients while lacking sufficient protective gear to keep them safe. People at the rally remembered Elva Graveline, a 52-year-old nurse's aide at Lawrence + Memorial who contracted the coronavirus and died May 19. Graveline's daughter thanked hospital workers for caring for her mother, according to the AFT Connecticut labor union. As of Friday, nearly 41,800 people in Connecticut tested positive for the virus and nearly 3,900 have died, including about 2,400 nursing home residents.",0.0

Shields called it “really shocking to watch.”Officials say the incident came to light via video that circulated online.It shows a group of police officers in riot gear and gas masks surround a car being driven by a man with a woman in the passenger seat.

THEY SAY THAT SOCIAL DISTANCING MUST STILL BE PRACTICED, STAYING SIX FEET APART AND FACE COVERINGS ARE ALSO IMPORTANT. THE MAYOR SAYS THE CURRENT CURFEW THAT WAS PUT IN PLACE AFTER THE DEMONSTRATIONS OVER THE WEEKEND IS NOT TO STIFLE PROTESTS Advertisement National coronavirus updates: Some US states are seeing increases in coronavirus cases Share Shares Copy Link Copy The latest:There have been more than 1.9 million coronavirus cases in the United States, according to the Johns Hopkins University tally.The U.S. death toll has surpassed 110,000 people, according to Hopkins.The longest economic expansion in American history is officially over. The National Bureau of Economic Research declared Monday that the recession began in February.The U.S. government's current supply of remdesivir, the only drug known to work against coronavirus, will run out at the end of the month.New World Health Organization guidance recommends that fabric masks — which can be homemade — be at least three layers.While states lift more restrictions and more Americans go out to socialize or protest, almost half of U.S states are seeing higher rates of new coronavirus cases.But the situation would have been much worse had states not shut down, a new study says.More than 1.9 million Americans have been infected, and more than 110,000 have died in just over four months, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.Nationwide, 22 states are seeing upward trends in coronavirus cases. About 20 states have seen decreases in recent days, and eight states are holding steady. One of the states with the biggest spikes in new cases is Florida. The number of new cases reported each day has increased an average of roughly 46% over the past week, just as most of the state entered a second phase of reopening.While big cities on the coasts were hit hard early in the pandemic, the past few weeks have seen wider spread in inland states, including Arkansas, Texas and Arizona.In Utah, state Rep. Suzanne Harrison called a recent spike of cases ""very concerning (and) approaching exponential.""""Today's 18.5% positive test rate is double yesterday's (9.4%),"" she tweeted over the weekend.Friday, health officials in Utah said they were ""very concerned"" about the rise in new cases over the past week.The state has recorded more than 12,000 infections, according to Johns Hopkins.Health officials raise concerns of virus spreading among protestsHealth officials have raised concern about coronavirus spread as thousands of people are now braving a pandemic to participate in the national protests sparked by the death of George Floyd.The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Sunday it was closely monitoring the demonstrations taking place across the U.S. and warned such gatherings could spur coronavirus transmission. Some states are already seeing upward trends of new cases.For three months, the country passed one grim milestone after the other, hitting 100,000 coronavirus deaths in late May. Public health officials have said without the lockdowns that most states put in place, that death toll could have been significantly higher.As those lockdowns were lifted and other measures were loosened, the CDC and other top health officials urged Americans to use face coverings when they go out and always maintain a distance.But the large protests make it hard to keep the recommended social distancing guidelines and ""may put others at risk,"" CDC spokesperson Kristen Nordlund said in a statement.""It is too early to know what, if any, effect these events will have on the federal COVID-19 response. Every local situation is different. State and local officials will make decisions to protect public health and safety based on circumstances on the ground,"" she said.Earlier this month, CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield said protesters should be evaluated and tested for the virus.""I do think there is a potential, unfortunately, for this to be a seeding event,"" he said — especially in metropolitan areas where there has been significant transmission.So far, more than 1,942,000 people have been infected in the U.S., and at least 110,514 have died, according to Johns Hopkins University.Some states see rise in new casesWhile the early parts of the outbreak in the country hit dense metropolitan areas on the coast the hardest — including California and New York — the past few weeks have seen wider spread in inland states, including Arkansas, Texas and Arizona.In Harris County, Texas, health officials said they identified a nursing home with both cases of the virus and deaths.On Friday, health officials in Utah said they were ""very concerned"" about the rise in new cases over the past week.The state has recorded more than 12,000 infections, according to Johns Hopkins.""When you're away from home, please avoid close contact with others, and wear a mask when other social distancing measures aren't feasible,"" the Utah Department of Health said on Twitter. Utah State Rep. Suzanne Harrison called the spike of cases ""very concerning (and) approaching exponential.""""Today's 18.5% positive test rate is double yesterday's (9.4%),"" she tweeted over the weekend. ""Please be careful. Practice social distancing. Avoid crowds. Use masks where appropriate. Wash your hands.""Several universities have also reported new cases within their athletic programs — including Arkansas State, Auburn University and Oklahoma State University.An important drug could run out Meanwhile, as officials emphasize the U.S. is not yet out of the woods, a government official gave a stark warning. The U.S. government's current supply of remdesivir, the only drug known to work against coronavirus, will run out at the end of the month, Dr. Robert Kadlec, a U.S. Department of Health and Human Services official, told CNN.The government's last shipment of the drug will go out the week of June 29. Gilead Sciences, the company that makes the drug, is ramping up to make more, but it's unclear how much will be available this summer.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration gave emergency authorization for remdesivir last month. The drug, an intravenous antiviral medication studied to treat Ebola, is now used on hospitalized Covid patients. A study has shown it helps cut down the length of hospital stays.The government has been working to help Gilead ""with some of their supply chain challenges in terms of raw materials and being able to accelerate the process,"" Kadlec said.""Whatever the supply may be, there may not be enough for everyone who may need it,"" he said.",0.0
1621527325,2020-05-31 07:00:18,"Robert Azzi: ‘Please, the knee in my neck, I can’t breathe, sir’",https://www.concordmonitor.com/A-knee-on-the-neck-34512067,en,False,,29410,concordmonitor.com,http://www.concordmonitor.com#spider,"“My GOD, so much hate from you in your [recent] column. It looks like you hate all white people. You should be ashamed of yourself, a man of your age. It’s people like you who drive people like me to vote for the MAN, Donald Trump. MAGA.” Such ugly messages – as that above received last week – are not uncommon in my inbox. Few, however, are as honest and as illustrative – linking racism and Donald Trump – of an America that, even at a time of economic collapse and pandemic, continues to be plagued by a contagion more persistent, more pernicious than the presence of COVID-19. An America that continues to be plagued by its original sin – racism. This past week, after Christian Cooper, a 57-year-old black birdwatcher asked a 41-year-old white woman, Amy Cooper (no relation), to leash her dog in the Bramble, an area of New York’s Central Park where leashing is required, the fragile white woman exercising her implicit privilege and power responded by calling the police, saying “an African American man in Central Park . . . is recording me and threatened myself and my dog. . . . Please send a cop! Immediately!” In Minnesota this past week cops immediately responded to a nonviolent allegation of forgery in Minneapolis. As a result, a black man, George Floyd, was killed after Derek Chauvin, a white Minneapolis police officer, in the complicit presence of three other policemen, exercising his privilege and power, unyieldingly pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck as he, handcuffed and prone on the asphalt, shouted he couldn’t breathe. “Please, the knee in my neck, I can’t breathe, sir.” “He should not have died,” Minneapolis Mayor Frey said. “What we saw was horrible, completely and utterly messed up. . . . Whatever the investigation reveals, it does not change the simple truth that he should be with us this morning.” “Being black in America should not be a death sentence,” the mayor continued. “When you hear someone calling for help, you are supposed to help. This officer failed in the most basic human sense.” Being black – being a person of color – in America shouldn’t be a death sentence: How many times must that sentiment be repeated, how many lives lost to prove the point? Indeed, how many lives may have been lost because there were no witnesses, no bystanders video recording deaths and lynchings. On Wednesday, as headlines lamented that more than 100,000 Americans had died of COVID-19 within approximately 100 days, it was also reported, less breathlessly, that with 20,000 deaths, African Americans are dying of the virus at three times the rate of white people. It was reported that COVID-19 is twice as deadly for black and Latinos than whites in New York City; that African Americans are 70% of all coronavirus cases in Chicago, which is 30% black. “Please, the knee in my neck, I can’t breathe, sir.” Within America’s Native communities the toll has been as deadly. The Navajo Nation has infection rates higher than any state: For example, in New Mexico, where Native Americans are 11% of the population they account for more than 50% of the COVID-19 cases. America’s minority communities and communities of color disproportionately suffer from COVID-19 because they have been oppressed – institutionally, medically, educationally, economically and politically disenfranchised – for generations, oppressed by a structural racism that has left their communities vulnerable and marginalized and less able to cope with the health impacts of a pandemic like COVID-19. “Please, the knee in my neck, I can’t breathe, sir.” Their oppressors – including those like my critic whom I quote above – refuse to recognize that their privilege dehumanizes others, resulting in a system where black lives matter less than white lives. Their insistence in believing they have rights superior to individuals whom they believe are unworthy, untrustworthy, lazy and ungrateful for the opportunities patronizingly offered to them by the dominant white class. It is within this racist paradigm that MAGA world thrives, a reality where, as Trump addressed the Veterans of Foreign Wars Convention in 2018: “Just remember, what you are seeing and what you are reading is not what’s happening.” A reality where anything that is not “Trump’s” truth is a lie. Trump’s reality – that which offends urban elites, immigrants, media and non-whites – is what mobilizes MAGA. Indeed, the more incompetent, incoherent and unhinged Trump is, the more loyal they are – and the more exploited they are. In the end they, too – unconsciously – are losing their breath, their lives, their jobs. They – unconsciously – within their resentments and grievances, are today betraying their own identities, families and faiths; today losing their humanity. Sadly, MAGA world cannot see that in the pursuit of securing their dominance as oppressor they are dehumanizing themselves, that as they’re dehumanizing the Other they’re dehumanizing themselves. If one is to breathe we must all breathe together. “As long as I fight,” Paulo Freire offered in Pedagogy of the Oppressed, “I am moved by hope; and if I fight with hope, then I can wait.” I fight with hope, and I can wait. Epilogue “A riot is the language of the unheard,” Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. said in 1966, and Thursday night, in Minneapolis and in other cities – after I had filed the column above – many protesters who had taken to the streets to protest the murder of George Floyd by police officers in full view of a shocked public turned to rioting and looting – in defiance of their oppressors – to demonstrate their opposition to a legal system that systematically fails to defend them. Fails to defend Trayvon Martin, Eric Garner, Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor and George Floyd. Fails to listen to the unheard.

Kennedy) said,"" Irving told KTRK. ""He said, 'Ask not what your country can do for you, but ask what you can do for your country.'""""So I'm coming down here and putting my little bit in, you know?""It was a scene that played out across the country after protests demanding justice in the death of George Floyd. The Minneapolis police officer seen in a video kneeling on Floyd's neck was arrested Friday and charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter.But that development wasn't enough to quell the anger of protesters in more than 30 cities, where demonstrations left charred vehicles, broken glass, litter and debris.KTRK reported one of its photojournalists saw Irving cleaning around 2 a.m. He said he spent about four hours cleaning the city, his home of more than 50 years.Irving said he understood the anger that has fueled protests in Minneapolis and across the country this week after Floyd's death. But Irving didn't understand the destruction, KTRK said.""We can protest,"" he said, ""but we don't have to destroy the city.""People come out to clean up without organized eventIn Kansas City, an army of helpers with trash bags, brooms and dust pans arrived to clean up the mess left behind after a night of violent and damaging protests.Helpers picked up what they could, and many of the areas where the Kansas City protest started were cleaned up by 8 a.m. Sunday.“When we look at the people that are cleaning up the debris this morning, the folks that are saying we want to bring our community together, you’re seeing the essence and the spirit of Kansas City,” Kansas City Mayor Quinton Lucas said.People helping clean said it was important to pick up their city.“I saw a lot of the protests and people rioting, a lot of buildings were smashed and it wasn’t their property,” said Beau Nossaman. “I thought I could help because a lot of people don’t seem to care.'We have to do this in unity'While there were some hired cleaning crews, several dozen volunteers gathered in downtown Atlanta Saturday morning to clean the aftermath of Friday night protests near the CNN Center, where demonstrators clashed with police.

At least one person is dead after being shot in Indianapolis. Police are investigating whether the incident was connected to demonstrations in the city. In Los Angeles, protesters blocked the 110 freeway downtown and were seen breaking windows of stores at The Grove mall. Floyd, 46, died after being arrested in Minneapolis on Monday. A video shows a police officer kneeling on his neck for at least seven minutes while Floyd is heard saying he cannot breathe. That police officer was arrested Friday and charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. Three other officers were present but have not been charged. All four were fired. Overnight curfews were enacted in cities nationwide — including Chicago, Atlanta, Los Angeles, Louisville, San Francisco and Denver — as authorities sought to stem any violence. The National Guard was also activated in several states, including Texas, Georgia, Washington, Ohio and Kentucky. In Minneapolis, authorities reported a ratcheting down of the previous night's unrest after an influx of National Guard troops and state troopers were dispatched to the city. ""Clearly we did not have the numbers in [Minneapolis police] alone,"" the city's mayor, Jacob Frey told Minnesota Public Radio early Sunday. ""Additional force was necessary."" Law enforcement began to make arrests in Minneapolis after an 8 p.m. curfew as crowds gathered at the 5th Precinct police building. Paul Schnell, the state corrections commissioner, said at a Saturday night press conference that an official count of arrests was not yet available but that authorities were ""committed to do whatever it takes to bring order."" Former Vice President and presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden released a statement early Sunday morning condemning the violence and urging Americans to ""take care of each other."" ""Protesting such brutality is right and necessary. It's an utterly American response,"" he wrote. ""But burning down communities and needless destruction is not."" We are a nation in pain, but we must not allow this pain to destroy us. We are a nation enraged, but we cannot allow our rage to consume us. Please stay safe. Please take care of each other. https://t.co/Y224rANwUF — Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) May 31, 2020 Biden added, ""the act of protesting should never be allowed to overshadow the reason we protest."" 1 person fatally shot in Indianapolis At least one person has died after being shot in downtown Indianapolis Saturday night. Police Chief Randal Taylor said at a press conference that authorities were still investigating the incident's connection to ongoing demonstrations in the city. ""Downtown is not safe at this time,"" Taylor said. He urged residents who do not live in the area to leave. Mayor Joe Hogsett called the day's protests ""successful"" in a tweet, but condemned the ""small group of people"" that grew violent later in the night. This afternoon, our city hosted a successful protest that allowed hundreds to lift up their cause and have their voices safely heard.  Since it ended, a small group of people have chosen to diminish that activism through inexcusable violence. It is unacceptable, and it must stop. — Mayor Joe Hogsett (@IndyMayorJoe) May 31, 2020 Police cruisers seen going through crowds in New York Several videos of protests in New York showed a police patrol vehicle driving through crowds of protesters. Protesters are seen surrounding and throwing debris at a car while another one drove into them. Mayor Bill de Blasio called the footage ""upsetting"" at a late night press conference Saturday but said it was ""inappropriate for protesters to surround a police vehicle and threaten police officers."" He addressed the city's peaceful protesters, saying they were heard but urging them to go home. ""We hear your desire to see these issues: relationship between police and community, the need for justice, the need for real change in our society,"" he said. ""We appreciate and respect all peaceful protests, but it is now time for people to go home."" California governor declares state of emergency in LA County Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti requested assistance to restore order Saturday night amid protests. A curfew began at 8 p.m. PT and is expected to end at 5:30 a.m. local time. The LAPD said hundreds of protesters were arrested amid the protests. An unlawful assembly was declared in the the Mid-Wilshire area and businesses were asked to close. Protesters blocked the 110 freeway in downtown LA and videos taken at protests showed looting and broken windows at stores in The Grove mall. Garcetti urged protesters to ""take a breath"" and ""step away"" at a press conference. He asked residents to go home and protest peacefully at a later time. We will always protect free speech and Angelenos’ right to live without fear of violence or vandalism. To increase safety for demonstrators, law enforcement and all citizens of Los Angeles, we are putting a curfew in place from 8 p.m. to 5 a.m. https://t.co/vy3XM760qb — MayorOfLA (@MayorOfLA) May 30, 2020 Gov.

Demonstrators flocked to the White House and nearby Lafayette Square throughout the afternoon where city and U.S. Park police and the Secret Service maintained barricades and pushed back against protesters, at times using pepper spray in an attempt to disperse crowds. Fireworks were set off and at least one car was set on fire. Buildings in downtown Washington had windows smashed — including the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute and an Apple store. A liquor store and a T-Mobile were also looted as tensions remained high through the early morning. The D.C. police union tweeted that one of its members had been hospitalized after being hit by a rock. We can confirm that at least one member has been hospitalized after being struck with a rock. — DC Police Union (@DCPoliceUnion) May 31, 2020 Earlier on Saturday, President Trump falsely accused the city's mayor, Muriel Bowser, of refusing to let D.C. police assist in containing Friday night's demonstrations. Bowser fired back at Trump at a Saturday press conference, saying the president's warning that ""ominous weapons"" and ""vicious dogs"" awaited any protester who made it past the White House fence was ""no subtle reminder"" of the country's history of segregationist violence. On Sunday morning, Bowser reiterated that sentiment on NBC's Meet The Press. ""I think the president has a responsibility to help calm the nation and he can start by not sending divisive tweets that are meant to harken to the segregationist past of our country and he can start by doing that right now,"" Bowser said. This is a developing story. Some things reported by the media will turn out to be wrong. We will focus on reports from officials and other authorities, credible news outlets and reporters who are at the scene. We will update as the situation develops. ",0.0

(AP Photo/Gregory Bull) Gregory Bull America’s cities boarded up windows, swept up glass and covered graffiti Sunday as the country’s most significant night of protests in a half-century promised to spill into another day of unrest fueled by killings of black people at the hands of police. The turbulence sparked by the death of George Floyd – a black man who died after being pinned under the knee of a white Minneapolis police officer – shook not only the streets of New York and Los Angeles, but dozens of smaller communities such as Fargo, North Dakota, and Lincoln, Nebraska. The damage extended even to buildings near the White House. Peaceful protests involving tens of thousands of people on Saturday gave way, in some places, to rioting, looting and violence, with police vehicles torched, stores emptied and objects hurled at officers. The police response varied from restrained to aggressive, with officers at times firing tear gas and rubber bullets. Police and peaceful protesters alike pleaded for a stop to violence, saying it only hindered calls for justice and reform. “It only hurts the cause,” said Danielle Outlaw, head of the police force in Philadelphia, where more than 200 people were arrested as fires and looting engulfed Center City. Disgust over generations of racism in a country founded by slaveholders combined with a string of recent high-profile killings to stoke the anger. Three months before Floyd’s death, Ahmaud Arbery was fatally shot as he jogged through a Georgia neighborhood. A white father and son are charged in the slaying. The month after Arbery was killed, an EMT named Breonna Taylor was shot eight times by Louisville, Kentucky, narcotics detectives who knocked down her front door. No drugs were found in her home. Adding to that was angst from months of lockdowns brought on by the coronavirus pandemic, which has disproportionately hurt communities of color, not only in terms of infections but in job losses and economic stress. The droves of people congregating in chanting demonstrations threatened to trigger new outbreaks, a fact overshadowed by the boiling tensions. “We’re sick of it. The cops are out of control,” protester Olga Hall said in Washington, D.C. “They’re wild. There’s just been too many dead boys.” The scale of the protests, sweeping from coast to coast and unfolding on a single night, rivaled the historic demonstrations of the civil rights and Vietnam War eras. Curfews were imposed in places around the U.S., including Atlanta, Chicago, Denver, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Seattle. About 5,000 National Guard soldiers and airmen were activated in 15 states and Washington, D.C. In Minneapolis, the city where the protests began, police, state troopers and National Guard members moved in soon after an 8 p.m. curfew took effect Saturday to break up demonstrations. The show of force came after three days in which police largely avoided engaging protesters, and after the state poured more than 4,000 National Guard troops into Minneapolis. Authorities said that number would soon rise to nearly 11,000. President Donald Trump appeared to cheer on the tougher tactics, commending the National Guard deployment in Minneapolis and declaring “No games!” He said police in New York City “must be allowed to do their job!” Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden condemned the violence as he continued to express common cause with those demonstrating after Floyd’s death. “The act of protesting should never be allowed to overshadow the reason we protest,” Biden said in a late-night statement. Dozens of additional protests were underway or expected on Sunday, from Miami to Kansas City to San Francisco. At the Minneapolis intersection where Floyd was killed, people gathered with brooms and flowers, saying it was important to protect what they called a “sacred space.” The intersection was blocked with the traffic cones while a ring of flowers was laid out. County Commissioner Angela Conley showed up shortly after the curfew lifted, saying that police had trampled flowers and photos of Floyd. “The community needs healing, and what happened last night only exacerbated the pain that’s been felt,” she said of police action. Conley said the demonstrations and confrontations with police would continue until the other three officers who were at the scene when Floyd was pinned down are arrested and prosecuted. The officer who put his knee on Floyd’s neck, Derek Chauvin, was charged last week with murder. All four officers have been fired. “We’ll continue to have this militarized presence in our community until justice is done,” Conley said. In tweets Sunday, Trump blamed anarchists and the media for fueling the violence. Attorney General William Barr pointed a finger at “far left extremist” groups. Police chiefs and politicians around the country accused outsiders of coming in and causing the problems. Few parts of America were untouched. Protesters set fires inside Reno’s city hall, and police launched tear gas at rock-throwing demonstrators in Fargo, North Dakota. In Salt Lake City, demonstrators flipped a police car and lit it on fire. Police said six people were arrested and an officer was injured after being struck in the head with a baseball bat. By Sunday, the fury had spread to Europe, where thousands gathered in London’s Trafalgar Square, clapping and waving placards despite government rules barring crowds because of the COVID-19 pandemic. At least 13 police officers were injured in Philadelphia, and at least four police vehicles were set on fire. In New York, a video showed two police cruisers lurching into a crowd of demonstrators who were pushing a barricade against one of them and pelting it with objects. Several people were knocked to the ground. It was unclear if anyone was hurt. “The mistakes that are happening are not mistakes. They’re repeated violent terrorist offenses, and people need to stop killing black people,” Brooklyn protester Meryl Makielski said. In Indianapolis, two people were reported dead in bursts of downtown violence, adding to deaths reported in Detroit and Minneapolis in recent days. Sites around the U.S. were defaced with spray-painted messages, from the facade of St. Patrick’s Cathedral in New York to the historic Hay-Adams hotel near the White House. Some of Floyd’s gasped last words – “I can’t breathe” – were repeated around the country, alongside anti-police messages. On Sunday, maintenance crews near the White House worked to replace windows that had been shattered with large pieces of wood. Buildings for blocks were marked with graffiti, including curses about Trump. Shattered glass still covered the sidewalks. The damaged buildings included the Department of Veterans Affairs, directly across the street from the White House. Some leaders prepared to put more soldiers in the streets by evening. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp authorized the deployment of up to 3,000 National Guard troops to Athens, Savannah and any other cities where more demonstrations were planned. Kemp had already approved up to 1,500 Guardsmen to help enforce a 9 p.m. Saturday curfew in Atlanta. This week’s unrest recalled the riots in Los Angeles nearly 30 years ago after the acquittal of the white police officers who beat Rodney King, a black motorist who had led them on a high-speed chase. The protests of Floyd’s killing have gripped many more cities, but the losses have yet to approach the staggering totals LA saw during five days of rioting in 1992, when more than 60 people died, 2,000-plus were injured and thousands arrested, with property damage topping $1 billion.",0.0

U.S. law allows terrorist designations for foreign groups since belonging to those groups doesn't enjoy the same protections. Antifa, short for anti-fascists, describes a broad group of people whose positions can be hard to define, but many members support oppressed populations and protest the amassing of wealth by corporations and elites. Some employ radical or militant tactics to get their message across. Typically, groups who identify as Antifa are amorphous and don't have a central leadership, though some local activists are highly organized, according to federal law enforcement officials. That has made it difficult for U.S. law enforcement to deal with violence from members of groups that label themselves as Antifa. Federal law enforcement officials told CNN they are aware of outside groups who are behind some of the property destruction and violence, using the cover of the legitimate protests in Minneapolis and elsewhere. Those domestic extremist groups include anarchists, white supremacists and far-left extremists, some of whom have overlapping affiliations.An announcement by the Justice Department on Sunday to use Joint Terrorism Task Forces around the country to investigate some of the violence in major cities singles out leftist Antifa activity, though U.S. law enforcement officials say there are groups from both the extremist left and right involved in the riots and attacks on police. In response to the president's tweet, ACLU National Security Project Director Hina Shamsi said there is ""no legal authority for designating a domestic group"" as a terrorist organization.""As this tweet demonstrates, terrorism is an inherently political label, easily abused and misused. There is no legal authority for designating a domestic group. Any such designation would raise significant due process and First Amendment concerns.""The Justice Department has studied the issue of creating a domestic terrorism law to apply to people involved in violence and who belong to domestic extremist groups, but the constitutional issues have been a hurdle to that effort.",0.0

The announcement on Saturday from the nation's eighth-largest retailer came after Target stores in multiple cities became scenes of violence and unrest. Among the stores where aisles were ransacked was a Target in Minneapolis near the city's 3rd police precinct, where the four officers who were fired after Floyd's death worked. The 3rd Precinct police station was damaged by a fire last week. ""We are heartbroken by the death of George Floyd and the pain it is causing communities across the country,"" the Minneapolis-based company said in a statement. ""At this time, we have made the decision to close a number of our stores."" A Target spokesperson said that the company is evaluating closures and limiting hours on a store-by-store basis. The majority of stores being closed are located in Minnesota and California, where protests in Los Angeles led the National Guard to be deployed. Stores will also close in Colorado, Illinois, Oregon and Pennsylvania. Despite the violence that has hit its stores, the company has voiced support for demonstrators. ""The murder of George Floyd has unleashed the pent-up pain of years, as have the killings of Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor,"" Target CEO Brian Cornell wrote in a public letter on Friday. ""We say their names and hold a too-long list of others in our hearts."" It remains unclear whether the looting at Target stores was committed by demonstrators or whether they were the actions of unaffiliated bad actors. But the ongoing demonstrations have focused scrutiny on Target's past work with law enforcement — including partnerships with agencies in at least 2o cities. In Minneapolis, the company partnered with police on a program that helped install closed-circuit television cameras in the downtown area. A 2010 report released with support from the company said the ""genesis of the program was a widespread feeling some years ago in the city of Minneapolis that the downtown business district was not a pleasant place to work or visit.""

The president has said that members of the loosely defined far-left group Antifa — short for ""anti-fascists"" — have led clashes with police and looting in cities across the U.S. since the killing of a black man in police custody in Minneapolis. It's unclear if any group or groups are primarily responsible for escalating protests that began following George Floyd's death on May 25 as Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin held his knee on Floyd's neck. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, a Democrat, has told the press that he'd heard unconfirmed reports that white supremacists were coming from elsewhere to stoke the violence. In one tweet on Sunday, Trump said the U.S. ""will be designating ANTIFA as a Terrorist Organization."" It's something he has previously floated, and last year two Republican senators introduced a resolution that sought to designate the group as a domestic terrorist organization. Following Trump's tweet, Attorney General William Barr said in a statement that ""[f]ederal law enforcement actions will be directed at apprehending and charging the violent radical agitators who have hijacked peaceful protest."" Barr added: ""The violence instigated and carried out by Antifa and other similar groups in connection with the rioting is domestic terrorism and will be treated accordingly."" The clashes, spreading to dozens of cities across the U.S., follow a series of racist incidents and deaths of black people, including Floyd's on Monday. Chauvin, now a former Minneapolis police officer, was seen on video kneeling on Floyd's neck while holding him in custody as Floyd pleaded that he couldn't breathe. Chauvin has been charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. Three other officers present at the scene have been fired but not arrested or charged. Protests and clashes that have since followed come at a time of unprecedented crisis for the country, with confirmed deaths from the coronavirus pandemic topping 100,000 and millions of people out of work as a result of broad business shutdowns. Minorities, including African Americans, have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19 deaths and pandemic-induced economic peril. ""The death of George Floyd on the streets of Minneapolis was a grave tragedy. It should never have happened. It has filled Americans all over the country with horror, anger, and grief."" pic.twitter.com/lirAMSv4Wo — The White House (@WhiteHouse) May 30, 2020 Trump addressed the demonstrations Saturday, striking a milder tone than he has on Twitter during prepared remarks following a space launch in Florida. He said Floyd's death ""has filled Americans all over the country with horror, anger and grief."" He added that he ""understands the pain that people are feeling"" and supports peaceful protest, but that ""the memory of George Floyd is being dishonored by rioters, looters and anarchists."" ""He should just sometimes stop talking"" Apart from Saturday's remarks, though, Trump has not often played a unifying role in recent days. His tweets about radical-left anarchists have also included criticism of Democratic leadership in Minnesota. In another tweet on Sunday, he blamed the mainstream media for fomenting ""hatred and anarchy."" Time for a change! #2020 https://t.co/AECy2GBfys — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 30, 2020 On Friday, Trump tweeted provocatively that ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts,"" a phrase with a racist history that Trump said he was not aware of. Later on, he said his intent was not to make a threat but to register a statement of concern that armed violence can accompany looting. Sen. Tim Scott, a South Carolina Republican, said on Fox News Sunday that the president's tweets about demonstrations turning violent are ""not constructive."" Speaking on ABC's This Week, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said on Sunday morning that she's not paying attention to Trump's inflammatory tweets. Instead, she said he ""should be a unifying force in our country. We have seen that with Democratic and Republican presidents all along. They have seen their responsibility to be the president of the United States, to unify our country and not to fuel the flame."" Also Sunday, Keisha Lance Bottoms — mayor of Atlanta, one city that has seen protests and clashes with police — told CBS' Face the Nation that Trump's tweets are ""making it worse"" and ""he should just sometimes stop talking."" In his own statement on Saturday, former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, wrote that ""Protesting [Floyd's killing] is right and necessary. It's an utterly American response. But burning down communities and needless destruction is not. Violence that endangers lives is not."" He added that as president, he'd lead the conversation about turning the nation's ""anguish to purpose."" Biden made an unannounced visit on Sunday to the site in Wilmington, Del., where protests had taken place the night before. ",0.0

Advertisement What is Antifa? Share Shares Copy Link Copy As protests over George Floyd's death spread across the country, officials have blamed the violent nature of some demonstrations on members of a controversial group known as Antifa.President Donald Trump on Sunday said the United States would designate Antifa a terrorist organization, though the federal government has no legal authority to label a wholly domestic group the way it designates foreign terrorist organizations.Speaking at the Kennedy Space Center on Saturday, Trump said the recent ""violence and vandalism"" seen across the country ""is being led by Antifa and other radical left-wing groups who are terrorizing the innocent, destroying jobs, hurting businesses and burning down buildings.""The president did not provide any evidence for his assertion.National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien echoed Trump's comments on CNN's ""State of the Union"" Sunday morning, telling Jake Tapper that the violence ""is being driven by Antifa.""CNN has not independently verified whether the group is involved in recent protests.Here's a closer look at Antifa protesters, who have become more visible in the last several years.What is Antifa?Antifa is short for anti-fascists. The term is used to define a broad group of people whose political beliefs lean toward the left — often the far left — but do not conform with the Democratic Party platform. The group doesn't have an official leader or headquarters, although groups in certain states hold regular meetings.Antifa positions can be hard to define, but many members support oppressed populations and protest the amassing of wealth by corporations and elites. Some employ radical or militant tactics to get their message across.Scott Crow, a former Antifa organizer, says the ""radical ideals"" promoted by Antifas are starting to be adopted by liberals. ""They would never have looked at (those ideals) before, because they saw us as the enemy as much as the right-wingers.""The majority of Antifa members don't fall into a stereotype. Since the election of President Trump, however, most new Antifa members are young voters.How did the group start?The exact origins of the group are unknown, but Antifa can be traced to Nazi Germany and Anti-Fascist Action, a militant group founded in the 1980s in the United Kingdom.Modern-day Antifa members have become more active in making themselves known at public rallies and within the progressive movement, says Brian Levin, director of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino.""What they're trying to do now is not only become prominent through violence at these high-profile rallies, but also to reach out through small meetings and through social networking to cultivate disenfranchised progressives who heretofore were peaceful,"" Levin said.Where do they protest?Members have been spotted at high-profile, right-wing events across the country.In August 2017 members of the group showed up in Charlottesville, Virginia, to condemn racism and counter protest hundreds of white nationalists opposed to the removal of a Gen. Robert E. Lee statue. The protests turned violent when James Fields, who is not a member of Antifa, plowed his car through a crowd of counter protesters, killing Heather Heyer.Video above: President Trump Says There Were 'Bad Dudes on the Other Side' in CharlottesvilleEarlier that year, Antifa protested the appearance of Milo Yiannopoulos, an alt-right provocateur, at the University of California, Berkeley. They also protested President Trump's inauguration in 2017.While it can be difficult to distinguish Antifa activists from other protesters, some dress head to toe in black. Members call this the ""Black Bloc.""They also wear masks to hide their identities from the police and whomever they are protesting.Why are they controversial?The group is known for causing damage to property during protests. In Berkeley, black-clad protesters wearing masks threw Molotov cocktails and smashed windows at the student union center where the Yiannopoulos event was to be held.Crow, who was involved with Antifa for almost 30 years, said members use violence as a means of self-defense and they believe property destruction does not equate to violence.""There is a place for violence. Is that the world that we want to live in? No. Is it the world we want to inhabit? No. Is it the world we want to create? No. But will we push back? Yes,"" Crow said.Levin said Antifa activists feel the need to partake in violence because ""they believe that elites are controlling the government and the media. So they need to make a statement head-on against the people who they regard as racist.""""There's this 'It's going down' mentality and this 'Hit them with your boots' mentality that goes back many decades to confrontations that took place, not only here in the American South, but also in places like Europe,"" he added.White nationalists and other members of the so-called alt-right have denounced members of Antifa, sometimes calling them the ""alt-left."" Many white nationalists from the Charlottesville rallies claimed it was the Antifa groups that led the protests to turn violent.Peter Cvjetanovic, a white nationalist who attended the Virginia protests, said he believes the far left, including Antifa, are ""just as dangerous, if not more dangerous than the right wing could ever be.""""These are people who preach tolerance and love while at the same time threatening people with a different political ideology. We go to our rallies and they harass us and attack us but they held theirs and we ignore them. You don't see right-wing protests get like this,"" Cvjetanovic told KRNV.But Crow said the philosophy of Antifa is based on the idea of direct action. ""The idea in Antifa is that we go where they (right-wingers) go. That hate speech is not free speech. That if you are endangering people with what you say and the actions that are behind them, then you do not have the right to do that.""And so we go to cause conflict, to shut them down where they are, because we don't believe that Nazis or fascists of any stripe should have a mouthpiece.""",0.0

Police custody. The rage out there is predictable. It's understandable, and it's legitimate. Unfortunately, it's being expressed right now over the past week in ways that are destructive. Minnesota's governor, Tim Walz, praise those who kept their protests peaceful. The raw emotions were on display, and, as I said yesterday, the beautiful expression of solidarity in community that we saw played out by peaceful protestors demonstrations elsewhere Saturday also began peacefully, right. More than two dozen cities nationwide had nighttime curfews in place, and protesters came out anyway, in some cases descending into chaos and destruction. Mayor Kesha Let's bottoms have seen two straight nights of protests in Atlanta. Right now we're talking about cars being burned and businesses being vandalized, and there's still so many issues that are right before us that we've lost. Sign up. Georgia is one of more than a dozen states, plus the District of Columbia that have activated the National Guard to respond to undressed Advertisement Police officers across US shown kneeling in solidarity, hug protesters Share Shares Copy Link Copy In the midst of protests and destruction around the nation, moving scenes unfolded across the U.S. Sunday when some of the city's police officers knelt with protesters.Aleeia Abraham shot a video of the officers taking a knee during a march in Queens calling for justice for George Floyd, who died while being arrested in Minneapolis, and in protest of the senseless killings of other black people.In the video, the protesters are kneeling and you can hear the crowd's surprise when some of the officers take a knee as well.""I definitely didn't expect that,"" Abraham said. ""I've never seen that.""As they knelt, one protester reeled off the names of other black people who had died, including Trayvon Martin and Ahmaud Arbery.Even as cities around the country have been rocked for days by violent protests, similar heartening scenes emerged over the weekend. In Florida Saturday, several officers from various agencies knelt with protesters in prayer in front of Coral Gables City Hall.In Oklahoma, photos captured the powerful moment when sheriff's deputies at the Oklahoma County Jail took a knee in solidarity with the protesters. Some officers were also seen talking to and hugging the protesters.In Iowa, Des Moines law enforcement took a knee outside of the Des Moines Police Department with protesters in solidarity.Shortly before 9 p.m. Sunday, protesters asked authorities to kneel with them in solidarity of George Floyd's death. Authorities kneeled with protesters for two minutes. After the moment was done, protesters dispersed from the area for the time being.""We've talked about many times in this building and everybody, every man and woman in the Des Moines Police Department knows what happened up there was wrong,"" said Des Moines Police Chief Dana Wingert. ""That's not what this is about. We've had a lot of violence. We've had a lot of unrest. But, what we saw tonight was a peaceful protest."" In Michigan, Genesee County Sheriff Chris Swanson walked with protesters after they chanted ""walk with us!""""Let's go, let's go,"" Swanson said as he and the cheering crowd proceeded. ""Where do you want to walk? We'll walk all night.""The New York march was peaceful and included a couple hundred people, Abraham said.Abraham, who runs an organization called The BlaQue Resource Network in Queens, said she'd never seen police do that in all her years of activism, or even on television at other protests.""That's great, it's a good sign, but what we're really looking for is action,"" she said.""I'll be even more impressed when we're not stepped on and gunned down. That's the moment I'm looking for.""The NYPD's 103rd Precinct is near where the march was held in the Jamaica neighborhood of Queens, so police knew about it in advance and were there.A pastor invited the officers to come into the circle of protesters to kneel with them, which was greeted with cheers from the crowd.All of the officers didn't kneel, Abraham said.Abraham said it was very nice of those officers who did kneel, but it was only a start.""I really want to be clear that that's not enough. It's a nice start, but it's nowhere near enough,"" she said.",0.0

The turbulence sparked by the death of George Floyd — a black man who died after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed a knee into his neck for several minutes — shook not only the streets of New York and Los Angeles, but dozens of smaller communities such as Fargo, North Dakota, and Lincoln, Nebraska. The damage extended even to buildings near the White House. ""They keep killing our people,"" said Mahira Louis, 15, who marched with her mother and several hundred others through downtown Boston on Sunday. ""I'm so sick and tired of it."" Peaceful protests involving tens of thousands of people on Saturday gave way, in some places, to violence, with police vehicles torched, stores emptied and objects hurled at officers. The police response varied from restrained to aggressive, with officers at times firing tear gas and rubber bullets. Police and peaceful protesters alike pleaded for a stop to violence, saying it weakened calls for justice and reform. ""It only hurts the cause,"" said Danielle Outlaw, head of the police force in Philadelphia, where more than 200 people were arrested as fires and looting engulfed the heart of the city. Disgust over generations of racism in a country founded by slaveholders combined with a string of recent racially charged killings to stoke the anger. Adding to that was angst from months of lockdowns brought on by the coronavirus pandemic, which has disproportionately hurt communities of color, not only in terms of infections but in job losses and economic stress. The droves of people congregating for demonstrations threatened to trigger new outbreaks, a fact overshadowed by the boiling tensions. ""Maybe this country will get the memo that we are sick of police murdering unarmed black men,"" said Lex Scott, founder of Black Lives Matter Utah. ""Maybe the next time a white police officer decides to pull the trigger, he will picture cities burning."" The scale of the protests, sweeping from coast to coast and unfolding on a single night, rivaled the historic demonstrations of the civil rights and Vietnam War eras. Curfews were imposed in major cities around the U.S., including Atlanta, Chicago, Denver, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Seattle. About 5,000 National Guard soldiers and airmen were activated in 15 states and Washington, D.C. In Minneapolis, police, state troopers and National Guard members showed new force Saturday in breaking up demonstrations after three days of police largely avoiding engaging protesters. Dozens of protests were underway or expected Sunday, from Miami to Kansas City to San Francisco. They went forth largely without incident, but sparks of crime continued. In Philadelphia, people robbed stores in broad daylight, and at least one more police vehicle was set ablaze. Streets leading downtown were closed. Chicago likewise restricted downtown access and called in the National Guard. At the Minneapolis intersection where Floyd was killed, people gathered with brooms and flowers, saying it was important to protect what they called a ""sacred space."" The intersection was blocked with the traffic cones while a ring of flowers was laid out. Among those descending on Minneapolis was Michael Brown Sr., the father of Michael Brown, whose killing by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, set off unrest in 2014. ""I understand what this family is feeling. I understand what this community is feeling,"" he said. County Commissioner Angela Conley said the demonstrations and confrontations with police would continue until the other three officers who were at the scene when Floyd was pinned down are arrested and prosecuted. The officer who held his knee on Floyd's neck, Derek Chauvin, was charged last week with murder. All four officers have been fired. ""We'll continue to have this militarized presence in our community until justice is done,"" Conley said. In tweets Sunday, President Donald Trump blamed anarchists and the media for fueling the violence. Attorney General William Barr pointed a finger at ""far left extremist"" groups. Police chiefs and politicians accused outsiders of coming in and causing the problems. Few parts of America were untouched. Protesters set fires inside Reno's city hall, and police launched tear gas at rock-throwing demonstrators in Fargo, North Dakota. In Salt Lake City, demonstrators flipped a police car and lit it on fire. Police said six people were arrested and an officer was injured after being struck in the head with a baseball bat. By Sunday, the fury had spread to Europe, where thousands gathered in London's Trafalgar Square, clapping and waving placards despite government rules barring crowds because of the COVID-19 pandemic. In New York, a video Saturday showed two police cruisers lurching into a crowd of demonstrators who were pushing a barricade against one of them and pelting it with objects. Several people were knocked to the ground. It was unclear if anyone was hurt. ""The mistakes that are happening are not mistakes. They're repeated violent terrorist offenses, and people need to stop killing black people,"" Brooklyn protester Meryl Makielski said. In Indianapolis, two people were reported dead in bursts of downtown violence, adding to deaths reported in Detroit and Minneapolis in recent days. Buildings around the U.S. were defaced with spray-painted messages, from the facade of St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York to the historic Hay-Adams hotel near the White House. Some of Floyd's gasped last words — ""I can't breathe"" — were repeated, alongside anti-police messages. Crews near the White House worked to replace windows that had been shattered with large pieces of wood. Buildings for blocks were marked with graffiti, including curses about Trump. Shattered glass still covered the sidewalks. The damaged buildings included the Department of Veterans Affairs, directly across the street from the White House. Some leaders prepared to put more soldiers in the streets. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp authorized the deployment of up to 3,000 National Guard troops to Athens, Savannah and any other cities where more demonstrations were planned. Kemp had already approved up to 1,500 Guardsmen to help enforce a 9 p.m. Saturday curfew in Atlanta. This week's unrest recalled the riots in Los Angeles nearly 30 years ago after the acquittal of the white police officers who beat Rodney King, a black motorist who had led them on a high-speed chase. The protests of Floyd's killing have gripped many more cities, but the losses have yet to approach the staggering totals LA saw during five days of rioting in 1992, when more than 60 people died, 2,000-plus were injured and thousands arrested, with property damage topping $1 billion.",0.0

The turbulence sparked by the death of George Floyd — a black man who died after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed a knee into his neck for several minutes — shook not only the streets of New York and Los Angeles, but dozens of smaller communities such as Fargo, North Dakota, and Lincoln, Nebraska. The damage extended even to buildings near the White House. ""They keep killing our people,"" said Mahira Louis, 15, who marched with her mother and several hundred others through downtown Boston on Sunday. ""I'm so sick and tired of it."" Peaceful protests involving tens of thousands of people on Saturday gave way, in some places, to violence, with police vehicles torched, stores emptied and objects hurled at officers.

""It only hurts the cause,"" said Danielle Outlaw, head of the police force in Philadelphia, where more than 200 people were arrested as fires and looting engulfed the heart of the city. Disgust over generations of racism in a country founded by slaveholders combined with a string of recent racially charged killings to stoke the anger.

About 5,000 National Guard soldiers and airmen were activated in 15 states and Washington, D.C.

Dozens of protests were underway or expected Sunday, from Miami to Kansas City to San Francisco. They went forth largely without incident, but sparks of crime continued. In Philadelphia, people robbed stores in broad daylight, and at least one more police vehicle was set ablaze. Streets leading downtown were closed. Chicago likewise restricted downtown access and called in the National Guard. At the Minneapolis intersection where Floyd was killed, people gathered with brooms and flowers, saying it was important to protect what they called a ""sacred space."" The intersection was blocked with the traffic cones while a ring of flowers was laid out. Among those descending on Minneapolis was Michael Brown Sr., the father of Michael Brown, whose killing by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, set off unrest in 2014. ""I understand what this family is feeling. I understand what this community is feeling,"" he said. County Commissioner Angela Conley said the demonstrations and confrontations with police would continue until the other three officers who were at the scene when Floyd was pinned down are arrested and prosecuted. The officer who held his knee on Floyd's neck, Derek Chauvin, was charged last week with murder. All four officers have been fired.

""This can be kind of a tinderbox for COVID,"" the 39-year-old venture capitalist said after attending a demonstration in Florida, one of many around the country sparked by the death of George Floyd, a black man who died after he was pinned at the neck by a white Minneapolis police officer. As more beaches, churches, mosques, schools and businesses reopened worldwide, the sudden and mass civil unrest in the United States is raising fears of new virus outbreaks in a country that has more confirmed infections and deaths than any other. And it's not just in the U.S. — London hosted a large anti-racism protest Sunday where demonstrators violated social distancing rules. Rosa Jimenez Cano said she planned to self-quarantine for 14 days, worrying she was perhaps ""irresponsible"" when she attended Saturday night's protest in Miami, where she exposed herself to crowds of people. Protests over Floyd's death — the latest in a series of killings of black men and women at the hands of police in America — have shaken the country from Minneapolis to New York, from Atlanta to Los Angeles. Some turned into riots and clashes with police, leaving stores in flames and torched cars in the streets. Health experts fear that silent carriers of the virus could unwittingly infect others at protests where people are packed cheek to jowl, many without masks, many chanting, singing or shouting. The virus is dispersed by microscopic droplets in the air when people cough, sneeze, sing or talk. ""There's no question that, when you put hundreds or thousands of people together in close proximity, when we have got this virus all over the streets ... it's not healthy,"" Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan said Sunday on CNN's ""State of the Union."" ""Two weeks from now across America, we're going to find out whether or not this gives us a spike and drives the numbers back up again or not."" The U.S. has seen over 1.7 million infections and nearly 104,000 deaths in the pandemic, which has disproportionately affected racial minorities in a nation that does not have universal health care. Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser said Sunday she was very concerned that the protests in the nation's capital and elsewhere could provide fertile ground for a new series of outbreaks. Many of the protesters were wearing masks, but there were no attempts at social distancing. ""We've been working very hard in these last eight to 10 weeks to not have any mass gatherings,"" she said. ""As a nation, we have to be concerned about a rebound."" Even the many protesters wearing masks are not guaranteed protection. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says cloth masks keep infected people from spreading the virus but are not designed to protect wearers from getting it. Mass protests in connection with Floyd's death were also being held in Europe. In London, thousands of people marched Sunday chanting ""No justice! No peace!"" while carrying signs reading ""Justice for George Floyd"" and ""Racism is a global issue."" Many demonstrators were not wearing masks and most in the crowd at Trafalgar Square were packed closely together. Britain has seen nearly 38,500 virus deaths, the second-highest in the world after the United States. In Berlin, hundreds of protesters picketed outside the U.S. Embassy on Saturday night under the motto: ""Justice for George Floyd."" Others marched near the U.S. embassy in Copenhagen, Denmark. Many Americans returned Sunday to in-person church services for the first time in weeks and tens of thousands of mosques reopened across the Middle East, but countries from India to Colombia still saw rising numbers of new infections. Nearly 6.1 million infections have been reported worldwide, with nearly 370,000 people dying, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. The true death toll is believed to be significantly higher, since many victims died of the virus without ever being tested. The situation worsened Sunday in India, where new daily cases topped 8,000 for the first time and 193 more deaths were reported. Despite that, India still is easing restrictions on shops and public transport in more states beginning Monday, although subways and schools will remain closed. In Saudi Arabia, mosques reopened Sunday for the first time in more than two months, but Islam's holiest site in Mecca remained closed. In Jerusalem, throngs of worshippers waited outside the Al-Aqsa Mosque before it reopened. Many wore surgical masks and waited for temperature checks as they entered. In Bogota, the capital of Colombia, authorities were locking down an area of nearly 1.5 million people as cases continued to rise. Mayor Claudia Lopez said no one in the working-class Kennedy area — inaugurated by the late U.S. President John F. Kennedy in 1961 — will be allowed out, except to seek food or medical care or in case of an emergency. Factories must also close. In Spain, Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez said Sunday that he would ask Parliament for a final two-week extension of the nation's state of emergency that is set to expire on June 7. That allows the government to keep ordering lockdown measures to control its coronavirus outbreak, which has claimed at least 27,000 lives, many of them in overwhelmed nursing homes. ""We have almost reached safe harbor,"" Sánchez said. At the Vatican, Pope Francis cautioned people against being pessimistic as they emerge from coronavirus lockdowns. During Mass in St. Peter's Basilica to mark Pentecost Sunday, Francis noted a tendency to say that ""nothing will return as before.""

Protests over Floyd's death — the latest in a series of killings of black men and women at the hands of police in America — have shaken the country from Minneapolis to New York, from Atlanta to Los Angeles.

It was the second time in a week that Biden left his home, following a brief Memorial Day wreath-laying ceremony at a veterans memorial in New Castle, Del. Biden has been campaigning exclusively from his house since coronavirus lockdowns began, repeatedly saying he is following stay-at-home orders issued by Delaware's governor. We are a nation in pain right now, but we must not allow this pain to destroy us.  As President, I will help lead this conversation — and more importantly, I will listen, just as I did today visiting the site of last night's protests in Wilmington. pic.twitter.com/0h2ApbKT0C — Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) May 31, 2020 As cities across the country have been overwhelmed by sometimes violent protests responding to Floyd's death — and as President Trump has stoked divisions with tweets about ""vicious dogs"" ready to respond to White House protests, labeling of Minnesota protesters as ""thugs"" and repeatedly blaming unrest on Democratic mayors and governors — Biden has tried to increase his visibility to portray a more empathetic and conciliatory approach to leadership. ""We are a nation in pain, but we must not allow this pain to destroy us,"" Biden wrote on Twitter and Facebook, alongside a picture of him on one knee, wearing a mask, speaking to a black man holding a child. ""We are a nation enraged, but we cannot allow our rage to consume us. We are a nation exhausted, but we will not allow our exhaustion to defeat us."" ""The only way to bear this pain is to turn all that anguish to purpose,"" Biden's post continued. ""And as President, I will help lead this conversation — and more importantly, I will listen, just as I did today visiting the site of last night's protests in Wilmington."" Biden's campaign posted a picture of the visit on social media but provided no additional information about how long Biden stayed at the protest site, how many people he talked to or when on Sunday he made the visit, which was not announced beforehand. While Biden and his campaign had purposely taken a low-visibility approach to the early days of the coronavirus crisis, preferring instead to keep the focus on President Trump and the daily press briefings credited with eroding the president's approval ratings, Biden has been much more responsive to Floyd's death and its aftermath, which have triggered a level of national protest not seen since the late 1960s. Biden delivered a five-minute speech from his Wilmington home Friday, framing Floyd's death as the latest example of a centuries old ""open wound"" of racism in the United States. Floyd's death, Biden said, was ""an act of brutality so elemental it did more than deny one black man in America his civil rights and human rights. It denied him of his very humanity and denied him of his life."" Earlier Friday, Biden spoke to Floyd's family on the phone. Floyd's brother, Philonise Floyd, told MSNBC on Saturday that during the call, ""I asked him could he please, please get justice for my brother."" A later call from President Trump, Floyd said, was much briefer. ""I was trying to talk to him, but he just kept, like, pushing me off,"" Floyd said. ",0.0

Police custody. The rage out there is predictable. It's understandable, and it's legitimate. Unfortunately, it's being expressed right now over the past week in ways that are destructive. Minnesota's governor, Tim Walz, praise those who kept their protests peaceful. The raw emotions were on display, and, as I said yesterday, the beautiful expression of solidarity in community that we saw played out by peaceful protestors demonstrations elsewhere Saturday also began peacefully, right. More than two dozen cities nationwide had nighttime curfews in place, and protesters came out anyway, in some cases descending into chaos and destruction. Mayor Kesha Let's bottoms have seen two straight nights of protests in Atlanta. Right now we're talking about cars being burned and businesses being vandalized, and there's still so many issues that are right before us that we've lost. Sign up.

It's unclear if First Lady Melania Trump and Barron Trump were also taken down with him.Trump has repeatedly praised the Secret Service for its handling of the protests outside the White House Friday night in the wake of George Floyd's death last week in Minneapolis.The New York Times first reported Trump was taken to the bunker.The decision to physically move the president came as protesters confronted Secret Service officers outside the White House for hours on Friday — shouting, throwing water bottles and other objects at the line of officers, and attempting to break through the metal barriers.At times, the crowd would remove the metal barriers and begin pushing up against the officers and their riot shields. The Secret Service continually replaced the barriers throughout the night as protesters wrestled them away.Protesters pushed hard enough a few times that officers had to walk away with what appeared to be minor injuries. At one point, the agents responded to aggressive pushing and yelling by using pepper spray on the protesters.Throughout the night, protesters could be heard chanting their support for Floyd, an unarmed black man who died last week after being pinned down by a white police officer, and their dislike of Trump. The protest, which began around 10 p.m. ET, Friday night outside the White House, had mostly quieted down by 3:30 a.m. ET, Saturday morning.The crowd thinned out and Secret Service officers were able to expand their perimeter and barriers around Lafayette Park across from the White House.Six arrests were made during the protests, the Secret Service confirmed in a statement Saturday afternoon.The president on Thursday had used the threat of police retaliation and military intervention in Minnesota where protests turned violent and destructive — saying on Twitter that ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts.""Trump's tweets on Saturday also invoked imagery tied to brutal civil rights-era police tactics.Now, a serious divide has emerged among the President's top allies and advisers over how the president should address several nights of protests and riots.Trump is being urged by some advisers to formally address the nation and call for calm, while others have said he should condemn the rioting and looting more forcefully or risk losing middle-of-the-road voters in November, according to several sources familiar with the deliberations.",0.0

In New Hampshire, about 800 protesters held a gathering in downtown Manchester that police described as ""peaceful"" and ""respectful. A much smaller group later protested at the Manchester police department. Soon after they arrived, Manchester Police Chief Carlo Capano emerged and for about half an hour spoke with a few protesters in the crowd, which at times erupted angrily with chants, such as ""George Floyd,"" ""I can't breathe,"" and ""Don't shoot."" Behind Capano, several officers stood quietly. Organizers of the original morning rally arrived at the station to try to head off an altercation, calm the crowd, and encourage constructive conversation. At one point some in the crowd left. The mood changed dramatically when a pickup truck flying a Trump flag drove by. An altercation apparently occurred between the truck occupants and the protesters, and the crowd began running toward the truck. Police also ran, overtaking the crowd and surrounding the truck, which had parked in a nearby lot. Before long, the occupants - identified later by police as a father and son- emerged and were handcuffed and driven away in a cruiser. It was later reported that one truck occupant had brandished a gun. Soon after, a tow truck loaded the truck and drove away. A small crowd of protesters remained at the scene, with some passing cars honking in solidarity. Meanwhile, New Hampshire has its own controversial arrest to contend with. On Sunday a crowd of about 200 gathered in Conway to protest the death of George Floyd and the arrest of an Albany man earlier this month during a traffic stop. Jean Saint Preux, who is African American, recorded the incident inside his car, in which two state troopers cracked his windows to reach in. State Police claim Saint Preux “refused to produce his license and vehicle registration"" and resisted arrest. In a statement, The N.H. Attorney General’s Office has said it will conduct ""an independent and comprehensive review of the facts and circumstances surrounding the May 20, 2020 arrest of Mr. Jean Saint Preux to ensure that the conduct of New Hampshire State Troopers Margaret Ready and Hawley Rae conformed with the law."" The ACLU of New Hampshire has filed a Right to Know request regarding the incident. We will discuss these events and more with our guests, all of whom have been very involved in improving minority-police relations. We'll get their response to the death of George Floyd, the clashes between protesters and police playing out across the country, and how New Hampshire is grappling with its own issues around race and policing. Listen to the conversation. GUESTS: Michael Carignan, Chief of the Nashua Police Department. He’s been with the department 26 years and has been chief for 9 months. He has promoted efforts to improve police relations with the city’s African American population and with high school students through the Nashua Community Conversation on Race and Justice, a group that formed several years ago to improve community-police relations. Sudi Lett, Youth and Education Coordinator for the Granite State Organizing Project, which works on social justice issues, including housing and education policy. He is also head coach of Varsity Basketball at Manchester Central High School. His father, Woullard Lett, was the longtime head of the NH NAACP. Jordan Thompson, Racial justice organizer for the ACLU-NH. He is launching Black Lives Matter Nashua this week. On Saturday, the Greater Nashua Area Branch of the NAACP and Black Lives Matter Nashua will hold a vigil and protest and call to action in honor of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and other victims of police brutality. The event is scheduled to begin at 6 p.m. in Greeley Park.",0.0

THEY SAY THAT SOCIAL DISTANCING MUST STILL BE PRACTICED, STAYING SIX FEET APART AND FACE COVERINGS ARE ALSO IMPORTANT. THE MAYOR SAYS THE CURRENT CURFEW THAT WAS PUT IN PLACE AFTER THE DEMONSTRATIONS OVER THE WEEKEND IS NOT TO STIFLE PROTESTS Advertisement National coronavirus updates: Some US states are seeing increases in coronavirus cases Share Shares Copy Link Copy The latest:There have been more than 1.9 million coronavirus cases in the United States, according to the Johns Hopkins University tally.The U.S. death toll has surpassed 110,000 people, according to Hopkins.The longest economic expansion in American history is officially over. The National Bureau of Economic Research declared Monday that the recession began in February.The U.S. government's current supply of remdesivir, the only drug known to work against coronavirus, will run out at the end of the month.New World Health Organization guidance recommends that fabric masks — which can be homemade — be at least three layers.While states lift more restrictions and more Americans go out to socialize or protest, almost half of U.S states are seeing higher rates of new coronavirus cases.But the situation would have been much worse had states not shut down, a new study says.More than 1.9 million Americans have been infected, and more than 110,000 have died in just over four months, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.Nationwide, 22 states are seeing upward trends in coronavirus cases. About 20 states have seen decreases in recent days, and eight states are holding steady. One of the states with the biggest spikes in new cases is Florida. The number of new cases reported each day has increased an average of roughly 46% over the past week, just as most of the state entered a second phase of reopening.While big cities on the coasts were hit hard early in the pandemic, the past few weeks have seen wider spread in inland states, including Arkansas, Texas and Arizona.In Utah, state Rep. Suzanne Harrison called a recent spike of cases ""very concerning (and) approaching exponential.""""Today's 18.5% positive test rate is double yesterday's (9.4%),"" she tweeted over the weekend.Friday, health officials in Utah said they were ""very concerned"" about the rise in new cases over the past week.The state has recorded more than 12,000 infections, according to Johns Hopkins.Health officials raise concerns of virus spreading among protestsHealth officials have raised concern about coronavirus spread as thousands of people are now braving a pandemic to participate in the national protests sparked by the death of George Floyd.The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Sunday it was closely monitoring the demonstrations taking place across the U.S. and warned such gatherings could spur coronavirus transmission. Some states are already seeing upward trends of new cases.For three months, the country passed one grim milestone after the other, hitting 100,000 coronavirus deaths in late May. Public health officials have said without the lockdowns that most states put in place, that death toll could have been significantly higher.As those lockdowns were lifted and other measures were loosened, the CDC and other top health officials urged Americans to use face coverings when they go out and always maintain a distance.But the large protests make it hard to keep the recommended social distancing guidelines and ""may put others at risk,"" CDC spokesperson Kristen Nordlund said in a statement.""It is too early to know what, if any, effect these events will have on the federal COVID-19 response. Every local situation is different. State and local officials will make decisions to protect public health and safety based on circumstances on the ground,"" she said.Earlier this month, CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield said protesters should be evaluated and tested for the virus.""I do think there is a potential, unfortunately, for this to be a seeding event,"" he said — especially in metropolitan areas where there has been significant transmission.So far, more than 1,942,000 people have been infected in the U.S., and at least 110,514 have died, according to Johns Hopkins University.Some states see rise in new casesWhile the early parts of the outbreak in the country hit dense metropolitan areas on the coast the hardest — including California and New York — the past few weeks have seen wider spread in inland states, including Arkansas, Texas and Arizona.In Harris County, Texas, health officials said they identified a nursing home with both cases of the virus and deaths.On Friday, health officials in Utah said they were ""very concerned"" about the rise in new cases over the past week.The state has recorded more than 12,000 infections, according to Johns Hopkins.""When you're away from home, please avoid close contact with others, and wear a mask when other social distancing measures aren't feasible,"" the Utah Department of Health said on Twitter. Utah State Rep. Suzanne Harrison called the spike of cases ""very concerning (and) approaching exponential.""""Today's 18.5% positive test rate is double yesterday's (9.4%),"" she tweeted over the weekend. ""Please be careful. Practice social distancing. Avoid crowds. Use masks where appropriate. Wash your hands.""Several universities have also reported new cases within their athletic programs — including Arkansas State, Auburn University and Oklahoma State University.An important drug could run out Meanwhile, as officials emphasize the U.S. is not yet out of the woods, a government official gave a stark warning. The U.S. government's current supply of remdesivir, the only drug known to work against coronavirus, will run out at the end of the month, Dr. Robert Kadlec, a U.S. Department of Health and Human Services official, told CNN.The government's last shipment of the drug will go out the week of June 29. Gilead Sciences, the company that makes the drug, is ramping up to make more, but it's unclear how much will be available this summer.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration gave emergency authorization for remdesivir last month. The drug, an intravenous antiviral medication studied to treat Ebola, is now used on hospitalized Covid patients. A study has shown it helps cut down the length of hospital stays.The government has been working to help Gilead ""with some of their supply chain challenges in terms of raw materials and being able to accelerate the process,"" Kadlec said.""Whatever the supply may be, there may not be enough for everyone who may need it,"" he said.",0.0
1622147711,2020-06-01 05:00:00,Trump Seems Likely To Use Law And Order As A Wedge Issue After George Floyd's Killing,https://www.nhpr.org/post/trump-seems-likely-use-law-and-order-wedge-issue-after-george-floyds-killing,en,False,,22716,nhpr.org,http://www.nhpr.org,"Through days of unrest, dozens of American cities — from Minneapolis to Atlanta, from New York to Grand Rapids, Mich. — have been wracked by violent protests. Racial wounds have been ripped open following the death of George Floyd, an unarmed black man in police custody in Minneapolis. The chaotic demonstrations and looting across the country have been blamed on outsiders of various political stripes, particularly ""radical-left"" groups like antifa, which is short for ""anti-fascist."" But the country is at an especially explosive moment, coming in the midst of a pandemic that has already killed more than 100,000 and an economic crisis with more than 40 million Americans unemployed — and in an election year no less. There's no telling how this plays out politically in November, with the election now five months away. Anything can happen. Five months ago, after all, the coronavirus was just a ""pneumonia of unknown cause."" President Trump called Floyd's death a ""grave tragedy"" that ""should never have happened."" Those remarks were made at the first launching of American astronauts into space from U.S. soil in almost a decade — what was one of the hopeful bright spots in this country, though it was overshadowed by the violent demonstrations. But once Trump was back on his favorite platform, Twitter, he again inflamed tensions, with machismo and politics at the forefront. He criticized local Democratic officials, saying Minneapolis's mayor, for example, was no ""General Douglas McArthur [sic] or great fighter General George Patton."" He has called demonstrators ""THUGS"" and warned that ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts"" — though he later said he didn't use that phrase as a threat. And he has employed violent, tough-guy imagery, alluding to the potential use of ""unlimited"" military power, ""vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons."" Even some Republicans criticized the president's language. Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, the only black Republican in the Senate, called the president's tweets ""not constructive"" on Fox News Sunday. And Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan told CNN that Trump is ""continuing to escalate the temperature,"" which is the ""opposite"" of what a leader should be doing right now. Meanwhile, Trump's national security adviser, Robert O'Brien, on Sunday waded into a crucial debate — whether there's ""systemic racism"" in police forces or whether there are just a few ""bad apples."" ""I don't think there's systemic racism"" in law enforcement, O'Brien said on CNN, ""but, you know what, there are some bad apples in there. ... There's no doubt there are some racist police"" but, he said, they're the minority. Americans are divided on their views of police. Back in mid-2017, Gallup found that 54% of Americans have a great deal or quite a lot of confidence in the police. But there were very different views by race. While 61% of whites had that level of confidence in police, just 45% of Hispanics and 30% of blacks did. Confidence in police nosedived among minorities and liberals after the rash of high-profile incidents of black men killed at the hands of police in 2014 and 2015, such as Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., Eric Garner in New York and Freddie Gray in Baltimore. Views of the police and law enforcement have become a sharp dividing line by race and party. In 2016, Trump declared himself the ""law and order candidate."" Expect him to try to exploit that again as a wedge issue in an effort to win over moderate whites upset by the video of Floyd's death but disapproving of the violent demonstrations. He said as much Sunday. He called for ""Law & Order in Philadelphia, NOW!"" and announced that the United States would be designating antifa a terrorist organization. Expect presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden and other Democrats now to have to answer if they agree or disagree with the antifa designation. Of course, it's also possible that Trump went too far already, something some advisers are privately concerned about, and that his rhetoric could hurt him with independents and suburban women. 5 things to watch this week 1. Trump's response to unrest: How Trump responds this week to the violent demonstrations and race relations in America could be consequential. Will it be Teleprompter Trump or Twitter Trump, or both at the same time once again? Florida Rep. Val Demings, who's on the shortlist to be Joe Biden's presidential running mate, said on NBC's Meet the Press on Sunday: ""If there ever was a time we need leadership in the White House, it is now, to help heal our nation, but I don't know why I would expect this president to do something that he has never done before."" 2. The great American coronavirus experiment: It's the first day of June, and with it, many states are making continued steps into phased reopenings. April and May saw more than 100,000 people die in the U.S. from the coronavirus. Some health experts have warned that a resurgence in cases could take place if Americans don't adhere to strict social distancing, or take other precautions like wear masks. The White House has also said that cases could go down in the warmer summer months. Does that happen? And if so, do Americans get too comfortable and lapse into a false sense of security — only to see a spike in the fall? None of it's clear, but the U.S. is heading into a period of pandemic experimentation with no vaccine or cure for the coronavirus as yet. 3. Could Steve King lose? Steny Hoyer faces challenge: It's hard to believe, but there are elections on Tuesday. Two of the marquee races deal with well-known — and very different — political figures. Controversial Rep. Steve King, with a history of making racist remarks, is in a fight for his political life with state Sen. Randy Feenstra in Iowa's Republican primary. Conservative groups have lined up against King, but he can't be counted out. This district has a long history of voting for him, despite his pariah status within the party. In Maryland, Steny Hoyer, No. 2 in House Democratic leadership, is facing a primary challenge from the left in 29-year-old McKayla Wilkes, inspired by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's unlikely win in New York over Joe Crowley, a former congressional Democratic leader. Iowa, Maryland and several other states, plus Washington, D.C., hold primaries Tuesday. 4. Biden to get closer to officially clinching nomination: Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee, is on the ballot Tuesday, too. Remember, he still hasn't acquired the delegates needed to officially put him over the top for the nomination. He is 425 delegates short of doing that. With 500 at stake Tuesday, Biden needs 85% of them Tuesday to clinch. That's unlikely, so look at next week, June 9, when Georgia and West Virginia vote — with their 133 delegates up for grabs — for Biden to hit the magic number of 1,991. (Follow all the math here with the NPR delegate tracker.) 5. Origins of Trump campaign investigation to be probed: In Congress, former Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein will testify Wednesday before the Senate Judiciary Committee, which is looking into the origins of the FBI's investigation into members of the 2016 Trump campaign. The Senate is also expected to vote on nominations, including for the Treasury Department's inspector general for the pandemic response. And action is possible on changes to the Paycheck Protection Program, or PPP. Last week, the House, nearly unanimously, passed a bill that reduces the percentage of the loans that businesses have to use toward payroll and gives businesses more time to spend the money and to pay the loans back. Flashback quotation: ""When you see these thugs being thrown into the back of a paddy wagon, you just seen them thrown in, rough. I said, 'Please don't be too nice.' When you guys put somebody in the car and you're protecting their head you know, the way you put their hand over [their head]. Like, 'Don't hit their head, and they've just killed somebody, don't hit their head.' I said, 'You can take the hand away, OK?' "" — Trump, on July 28, 2017, speaking to law enforcement officers in Long Island, N.Y. : 5/31/20 A previous version of this story misspelled Freddie Gray's first name as Freddy.",0.0

Some cities, including Minneapolis, Atlanta and Louisville, saw clashes with police, buildings and cars set afire, and looting. By evening, many demonstrations had given way to another night of violence and destruction, with protesters ignoring curfews imposed in dozens of cities. Police used tear gas and stun grenades and fired rubber bullets in attempts to disperse the crowds. More than 17,000 National Guard troops have been activated in states across the U.S. due to civil unrest as of Monday, and that number is expected to grow. Floyd, a 46-year-old black man, died in police custody last Monday. Video shows that a Minneapolis police officer had his knee on Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes shortly before his death. Tensions were already simmering following the deaths of Ahmaud Arbery in February and Breonna Taylor in March. Arbery, a 25-year-old black man, was jogging through a Glynn County, Ga., neighborhood when he was shot dead. Three white men were arrested last month after state investigators took over the case from local authorities. Protests also continued for a fourth straight night in Louisville, Ky., as activists called for justice for Taylor. Police shot and killed the 26-year-old black woman in her home. Truck barrels into Minneapolis protesters In Minneapolis, a semitrailer plowed through a crowd of protesters marching on an interstate highway near downtown that had been closed to traffic. Authorities say no one was injured when the truck drove into the crowd at a high speed, westbound on Interstate 35. According to the Minnesota Department of Public Safety, the driver may have been unaware of the highway closure. ""It appears the semi was on I-35W as authorities were closing the road. It didn't appear to drive through any barricades,"" the department tweeted. Some protesters jumped on top of the truck, and as it stopped, they dragged the driver out of the front seat and started beating him. The driver, identified by police as Bogdan Vechirko of Otsego, Minn., is being held on probable cause for assault. He was taken to a hospital and is being treated for his injuries. ""He was driving a gas tanker,"" said Rhys Gailah, 39, who was in the middle of a sit-in listening to speakers when the truck came barreling through. ""He came driving at least 50 miles per hour through the crowd. Everyone was sitting. It was peaceful."" State Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington says authorities had shut down the freeway so that the protesters, who numbered from 4,000 to 5,000, could safely demonstrate. Before the incident, the protest had appeared peaceful. Tensions flare in the nation's capital Washington, D.C., authorities imposed a curfew after an evening of escalating demonstrations. Protesters threw bottles at police and set fires to cars and the basement of historic St. John's Church, which has been visited by every president since James Madison. ""Tonight's curfew will begin at 7 p.m. and will run for two days,"" D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser said at a late morning news conference on Monday. It's primary day in the nation's capital on Tuesday, and the curfew goes into effect an hour before polls close at 8 p.m., according to the District of Columbia Board of Elections website. The protests on Sunday began with peaceful marchers, along with a police escort, moving their way along a nearly 2-mile stretch from Howard University to Lafayette Square in front of the White House. Protesters chanted about the death of Floyd and other African Americans who have died following police violence. ""Even in the middle of a pandemic, cops are killing us,"" read a sign carried by protester Elizabeth Betts. ""It's crazy how even in the middle of a pandemic, black people have to protest like this,"" she said. ""We are at a point where it's the same story, the same things are happening. I'm tired of this."" But after clashes with law enforcement and the fires erupting, police pushed the crowds away from the White House with bursts of tear gas. Kentucky authorities investigate shooting death in Louisville Kentucky's governor said that one person died early Monday as security forces confronted a crowd in central Louisville. ""While working to disperse a crowd, [Louisville Metro Police Department] and the Kentucky National Guard were fired upon,"" Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said in a statement. ""LMPD and the Kentucky National Guard returned fire resulting in a death."" He announced that the Kentucky State Police will be investigating the matter. Statement from Governor Andy Beshear: pic.twitter.com/MyHxcE3Ntn — Governor Andy Beshear (@GovAndyBeshear) June 1, 2020 Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer tweeted his ""deepest condolences"" for the family of the man, whom he identified as David McAtee. Fischer also called for a Day of Reflection on Monday. He held a late morning virtual gathering on Facebook with faith leaders after another night of demonstrations in the city over the death of Breonna Taylor. On Sunday, law enforcement officers earlier fired tear gas into a crowd assembled in the Jefferson Square area of the city, NPR member station WFPL reported. At a Sunday evening news conference, Fischer again thanked those protesting peacefully but said others were ""hijacking"" their efforts. Tomorrow, Monday, June 1, 2020 I am declaring a Day of Reflection in our city. We will have a virtual gathering at 11:30 a.m. Monday on Facebook with local faith leaders. We’ll be talking about the events of the last few days & acknowledging the pain we’ve all felt. 2/2 — Mayor Greg Fischer (@louisvillemayor) June 1, 2020 Atlanta officers terminated for excessive force Two Atlanta police officers have been terminated and three others placed on desk duty after a video of the arrest of two young African Americans leaving the protests Saturday night went viral. Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms announced the officers' firing on Sunday, saying the footage ""was disturbing on many levels."" ""We understand our officers are working very long hours, under an enormous amount of stress,"" Bottoms said. ""But we also understand that the use of excessive force is never acceptable."" Georgia Public Broadcasting reported that veteran officers Mark Gardner and Ivory Streeter were terminated. The footage from Streeter's body camera shows the officers confronting the pair as the two were leaving the downtown protests after the 9 p.m. curfew went into effect. At roughly the 2:30 mark in the video, one of them is seen sitting in the driver's seat of a car, recording officers arresting someone else. An officer opens the car door and asks the driver if he wants to go to jail. Several minutes later, officers approach the car again. One uses a baton to smash the driver's side window. Police then use a stun gun on the driver, who has been identified by local media as Messiah Young. Georgia Public Broadcasting reported that Young suffered an epileptic seizure, according to Spelman College's Student Government Association. The second person, a woman who has since been identified as Taniyah Pilgrim, has been released from custody and charges against her dropped. Footage posted by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution shows the passenger pleading with police to stop as they also use a stun gun against her. ''They haven't heard us"": Protests escalate in Southern California Vandalism and violence broke out after peaceful protests in Santa Monica and other parts of Southern California on Sunday — a sequence of events that has become familiar in many U.S. cities in the past week. The new round of destruction came despite a curfew and the presence of the National Guard. ""We tried kneeling,"" protester Jesus Guzman, 19, told NPR's Doualy Xaykaothao near the Santa Monica Pier. ""We tried putting on those T-shirts that said 'I can't breathe.' We tried those hashtags. We tried doing it all peacefully, but they haven't heard us — they haven't done nothing."" ""The violence, for him, is justified,"" Xaykaothao reported. With store windows smashed, some shop owners in Santa Monica started cleaning up the mess overnight — the latest setback after weeks of forced closures because of the COVID-19 pandemic. At their hair salon, Martha Padilla-Bruni and her family were sweeping up broken glass under the streetlights. ""I'm in shock. I don't know what's going to happen,"" Padilla-Bruni told NPR's Nathan Rott. Her son, Joe Franco, said he supports the protesters and those who were there earlier in the day. He said he understands that people are in pain. Franco said, ""But I was here across the street, and what I saw, the people that were doing this ... they were not here to protest. They were here to cause trouble."" Reporter in Long Beach, Calif., hit in throat by rubber bullet KPCC/LAist reporter Adolfo Guzman-Lopez was hit in the throat by a rubber bullet Sunday evening during protests in Long Beach, Calif. He believes the bullet was fired by Long Beach police, who had been firing the projectiles nearby. ""I just got hit by a rubber bullet near the bottom of my throat,"" Guzman-Lopez said via Twitter, posting an image of his wound. ""I had just interviewed a man with my phone at 3rd and Pine and a police officer aimed and shot me in the throat, I saw the bullet bounce onto the street."" I just got hit by a rubber bullet near the bottom of my throat. I had just interviewed a man with my phone at 3rd and Pine and a police officer aimed and shot me in the throat, I saw the bullet bounce onto the street @LAist @kpcc OK, that’s one way to stop me, for a while pic.twitter.com/9C2u5KmscG — Adolfo Guzman-Lopez (@AGuzmanLopez) June 1, 2020 Guzman-Lopez was able to breathe and was checked out by doctors Sunday night. The reporter said he had just finished interviewing a man who had been kneeling in protest when he himself was hit. ""I talked to him for about a minute, and just as I was finishing talking to him — right after I said, 'Thank you' — I heard a pop and I felt something, you know, the bottom of my throat, and I saw something bounced onto the ground, and then I ran,"" he said. ""As I was running, I did start to feel its sting, and then I put my fingers to my throat and there was blood on my fingers."" A number of journalists have been hit with police projectiles during the protests, including MSNBC's Ali Velshi, who was shot in the leg by a rubber bullet in Minneapolis, and a Louisville TV reporter who was shot with pepper balls.

(AP Photo/Gregory Bull) Gregory Bull America’s cities boarded up windows, swept up glass and covered graffiti Sunday as the country’s most significant night of protests in a half-century promised to spill into another day of unrest fueled by killings of black people at the hands of police. The turbulence sparked by the death of George Floyd – a black man who died after being pinned under the knee of a white Minneapolis police officer – shook not only the streets of New York and Los Angeles, but dozens of smaller communities such as Fargo, North Dakota, and Lincoln, Nebraska. The damage extended even to buildings near the White House. Peaceful protests involving tens of thousands of people on Saturday gave way, in some places, to rioting, looting and violence, with police vehicles torched, stores emptied and objects hurled at officers. The police response varied from restrained to aggressive, with officers at times firing tear gas and rubber bullets. Police and peaceful protesters alike pleaded for a stop to violence, saying it only hindered calls for justice and reform. “It only hurts the cause,” said Danielle Outlaw, head of the police force in Philadelphia, where more than 200 people were arrested as fires and looting engulfed Center City. Disgust over generations of racism in a country founded by slaveholders combined with a string of recent high-profile killings to stoke the anger. Three months before Floyd’s death, Ahmaud Arbery was fatally shot as he jogged through a Georgia neighborhood. A white father and son are charged in the slaying. The month after Arbery was killed, an EMT named Breonna Taylor was shot eight times by Louisville, Kentucky, narcotics detectives who knocked down her front door. No drugs were found in her home. Adding to that was angst from months of lockdowns brought on by the coronavirus pandemic, which has disproportionately hurt communities of color, not only in terms of infections but in job losses and economic stress. The droves of people congregating in chanting demonstrations threatened to trigger new outbreaks, a fact overshadowed by the boiling tensions. “We’re sick of it. The cops are out of control,” protester Olga Hall said in Washington, D.C. “They’re wild. There’s just been too many dead boys.” The scale of the protests, sweeping from coast to coast and unfolding on a single night, rivaled the historic demonstrations of the civil rights and Vietnam War eras. Curfews were imposed in places around the U.S., including Atlanta, Chicago, Denver, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Seattle. About 5,000 National Guard soldiers and airmen were activated in 15 states and Washington, D.C. In Minneapolis, the city where the protests began, police, state troopers and National Guard members moved in soon after an 8 p.m. curfew took effect Saturday to break up demonstrations. The show of force came after three days in which police largely avoided engaging protesters, and after the state poured more than 4,000 National Guard troops into Minneapolis. Authorities said that number would soon rise to nearly 11,000. President Donald Trump appeared to cheer on the tougher tactics, commending the National Guard deployment in Minneapolis and declaring “No games!” He said police in New York City “must be allowed to do their job!” Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden condemned the violence as he continued to express common cause with those demonstrating after Floyd’s death. “The act of protesting should never be allowed to overshadow the reason we protest,” Biden said in a late-night statement. Dozens of additional protests were underway or expected on Sunday, from Miami to Kansas City to San Francisco. At the Minneapolis intersection where Floyd was killed, people gathered with brooms and flowers, saying it was important to protect what they called a “sacred space.” The intersection was blocked with the traffic cones while a ring of flowers was laid out. County Commissioner Angela Conley showed up shortly after the curfew lifted, saying that police had trampled flowers and photos of Floyd. “The community needs healing, and what happened last night only exacerbated the pain that’s been felt,” she said of police action. Conley said the demonstrations and confrontations with police would continue until the other three officers who were at the scene when Floyd was pinned down are arrested and prosecuted. The officer who put his knee on Floyd’s neck, Derek Chauvin, was charged last week with murder. All four officers have been fired. “We’ll continue to have this militarized presence in our community until justice is done,” Conley said. In tweets Sunday, Trump blamed anarchists and the media for fueling the violence. Attorney General William Barr pointed a finger at “far left extremist” groups. Police chiefs and politicians around the country accused outsiders of coming in and causing the problems. Few parts of America were untouched. Protesters set fires inside Reno’s city hall, and police launched tear gas at rock-throwing demonstrators in Fargo, North Dakota. In Salt Lake City, demonstrators flipped a police car and lit it on fire. Police said six people were arrested and an officer was injured after being struck in the head with a baseball bat. By Sunday, the fury had spread to Europe, where thousands gathered in London’s Trafalgar Square, clapping and waving placards despite government rules barring crowds because of the COVID-19 pandemic. At least 13 police officers were injured in Philadelphia, and at least four police vehicles were set on fire. In New York, a video showed two police cruisers lurching into a crowd of demonstrators who were pushing a barricade against one of them and pelting it with objects. Several people were knocked to the ground. It was unclear if anyone was hurt. “The mistakes that are happening are not mistakes. They’re repeated violent terrorist offenses, and people need to stop killing black people,” Brooklyn protester Meryl Makielski said. In Indianapolis, two people were reported dead in bursts of downtown violence, adding to deaths reported in Detroit and Minneapolis in recent days. Sites around the U.S. were defaced with spray-painted messages, from the facade of St. Patrick’s Cathedral in New York to the historic Hay-Adams hotel near the White House. Some of Floyd’s gasped last words – “I can’t breathe” – were repeated around the country, alongside anti-police messages. On Sunday, maintenance crews near the White House worked to replace windows that had been shattered with large pieces of wood. Buildings for blocks were marked with graffiti, including curses about Trump. Shattered glass still covered the sidewalks. The damaged buildings included the Department of Veterans Affairs, directly across the street from the White House. Some leaders prepared to put more soldiers in the streets by evening. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp authorized the deployment of up to 3,000 National Guard troops to Athens, Savannah and any other cities where more demonstrations were planned. Kemp had already approved up to 1,500 Guardsmen to help enforce a 9 p.m. Saturday curfew in Atlanta. This week’s unrest recalled the riots in Los Angeles nearly 30 years ago after the acquittal of the white police officers who beat Rodney King, a black motorist who had led them on a high-speed chase. The protests of Floyd’s killing have gripped many more cities, but the losses have yet to approach the staggering totals LA saw during five days of rioting in 1992, when more than 60 people died, 2,000-plus were injured and thousands arrested, with property damage topping $1 billion.",0.0

The Netherlands A large peaceful protest against George Floyd's killing and police brutality, filled Dam Square in central Amsterdam in solidarity with American protesters on Monday. Demonstrators carried signs that read ""Police violence is not an accident,"" ""Racism is a pandemic"" and ""My skin ain't a crime."" Naomie Pieter, an Amsterdam based anti-racism activist, called out to the crowd from a stage, ""Black women's lives, black trans lives, black disabled lives,"" with demonstrators responding ""Matter!"" to each exclamation. The majority of protesters wore masks, and there were no immediate reports of violence or arrests. Germany In Berlin, protesters gathered Sunday outside the U.S. Embassy, demonstrating for a second day. Hundreds of German demonstrators marched in solidarity with American protesters Saturday and Sunday, chanting ""Stop killing us,"" ""Black lives matter"" and ""No justice, no peace."" On a former section of the Berlin Wall, in Mauerpark, a memorial popped up over the weekend depicting Floyd and ""I can't breathe,"" some of his last words. Beyond protests that gathered thousands at the capital over the weekend, four soccer players in Germany's Bundesliga league addressed Floyd's killing during games.

The protest was concentrated in central London, with hundreds taking a knee in Trafalgar Square for nine minutes, signifying the amount of time the former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin pinned Floyd to the ground. They marched along the Thames and to the U.S. Embassy, chanting ""Black lives matter"" and carrying signs with slogans such as ""Racism is a global issue,"" ""Your silence is deafening"" and ""How many more?"" According to the Metropolitan Police, 23 demonstrators were arrested in central London on Sunday. Elsewhere in the U.K., demonstrations also took place in Manchester and Cardiff. Canada In Canada, people in Toronto gathered in protest against injustice toward black people globally and against the death of Regis Korchinski-Paquet, a 29-year-old black woman who lived in Toronto, and the circumstances surrounding her death. Korchinski-Paquet fell from her balcony while police officers were responding to a domestic incident in her home. New Zealand Despite coronavirus-related restrictions on large gatherings, thousands took to the streets to protest police brutality in Auckland, sparking criticism from some political leaders. Organizers tried to encourage social distancing, The New Zealand Herald reported, but the large turnout forced demonstrators close together. Protesters marched and chanted ""No justice, no peace"" and ""Black lives matter."" Toward the end of the march, video posted on social media showed demonstrators participating in an impromptu haka, a ceremonial dance of the Maori people. after kneeling, an impromptu haka breaks out in an act of solidarity for Māori pic.twitter.com/ZijeQvzR8Z — jihee junn (@jiheejunn) June 1, 2020 Demonstrators also gathered in the smaller cities of Wellington, Christchurch and Dunedin.

It looks like you hate all white people. You should be ashamed of yourself, a man of your age. It’s people like you who drive people like me to vote for the MAN, Donald Trump. MAGA.” Such ugly messages – as that above received last week – are not uncommon in my inbox. Few, however, are as honest and as illustrative – linking racism and Donald Trump – of an America that, even at a time of economic collapse and pandemic, continues to be plagued by a contagion more persistent, more pernicious than the presence of COVID-19. An America that continues to be plagued by its original sin – racism. This past week, after Christian Cooper, a 57-year-old black birdwatcher asked a 41-year-old white woman, Amy Cooper (no relation), to leash her dog in the Bramble, an area of New York’s Central Park where leashing is required, the fragile white woman exercising her implicit privilege and power responded by calling the police, saying “an African American man in Central Park . . . is recording me and threatened myself and my dog. . . . Please send a cop! Immediately!” In Minnesota this past week cops immediately responded to a nonviolent allegation of forgery in Minneapolis. As a result, a black man, George Floyd, was killed after Derek Chauvin, a white Minneapolis police officer, in the complicit presence of three other policemen, exercising his privilege and power, unyieldingly pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck as he, handcuffed and prone on the asphalt, shouted he couldn’t breathe. “Please, the knee in my neck, I can’t breathe, sir.” “He should not have died,” Minneapolis Mayor Frey said. “What we saw was horrible, completely and utterly messed up. . . . Whatever the investigation reveals, it does not change the simple truth that he should be with us this morning.” “Being black in America should not be a death sentence,” the mayor continued. “When you hear someone calling for help, you are supposed to help. This officer failed in the most basic human sense.” Being black – being a person of color – in America shouldn’t be a death sentence: How many times must that sentiment be repeated, how many lives lost to prove the point? Indeed, how many lives may have been lost because there were no witnesses, no bystanders video recording deaths and lynchings. On Wednesday, as headlines lamented that more than 100,000 Americans had died of COVID-19 within approximately 100 days, it was also reported, less breathlessly, that with 20,000 deaths, African Americans are dying of the virus at three times the rate of white people. It was reported that COVID-19 is twice as deadly for black and Latinos than whites in New York City; that African Americans are 70% of all coronavirus cases in Chicago, which is 30% black. “Please, the knee in my neck, I can’t breathe, sir.” Within America’s Native communities the toll has been as deadly. The Navajo Nation has infection rates higher than any state: For example, in New Mexico, where Native Americans are 11% of the population they account for more than 50% of the COVID-19 cases. America’s minority communities and communities of color disproportionately suffer from COVID-19 because they have been oppressed – institutionally, medically, educationally, economically and politically disenfranchised – for generations, oppressed by a structural racism that has left their communities vulnerable and marginalized and less able to cope with the health impacts of a pandemic like COVID-19. “Please, the knee in my neck, I can’t breathe, sir.” Their oppressors – including those like my critic whom I quote above – refuse to recognize that their privilege dehumanizes others, resulting in a system where black lives matter less than white lives. Their insistence in believing they have rights superior to individuals whom they believe are unworthy, untrustworthy, lazy and ungrateful for the opportunities patronizingly offered to them by the dominant white class. It is within this racist paradigm that MAGA world thrives, a reality where, as Trump addressed the Veterans of Foreign Wars Convention in 2018: “Just remember, what you are seeing and what you are reading is not what’s happening.” A reality where anything that is not “Trump’s” truth is a lie. Trump’s reality – that which offends urban elites, immigrants, media and non-whites – is what mobilizes MAGA. Indeed, the more incompetent, incoherent and unhinged Trump is, the more loyal they are – and the more exploited they are. In the end they, too – unconsciously – are losing their breath, their lives, their jobs. They – unconsciously – within their resentments and grievances, are today betraying their own identities, families and faiths; today losing their humanity. Sadly, MAGA world cannot see that in the pursuit of securing their dominance as oppressor they are dehumanizing themselves, that as they’re dehumanizing the Other they’re dehumanizing themselves. If one is to breathe we must all breathe together. “As long as I fight,” Paulo Freire offered in Pedagogy of the Oppressed, “I am moved by hope; and if I fight with hope, then I can wait.” I fight with hope, and I can wait. Epilogue “A riot is the language of the unheard,” Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. said in 1966, and Thursday night, in Minneapolis and in other cities – after I had filed the column above – many protesters who had taken to the streets to protest the murder of George Floyd by police officers in full view of a shocked public turned to rioting and looting – in defiance of their oppressors – to demonstrate their opposition to a legal system that systematically fails to defend them. Fails to defend Trayvon Martin, Eric Garner, Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor and George Floyd. Fails to listen to the unheard.

DON’T WAIT FOR KIDS TO BRING RICE UP. HELP KIDS BUILD A POSITIVE AWARENESS OF DIVERSITY. I POSTED LINKS TO AL Advertisement How to talk to your children about protests and racism Share Shares Copy Link Copy Video may contain images that are offensive. Viewer discretion is advised.As cities and social media explode with anger over the killing of yet another black man at the hands of police, worried parents struggle with how to protect their children from seeing the worst of the violence while simultaneously explaining the ravages of racism.It couldn't have come at a worse time.Sheltering at home for months to avoid the deadly coronavirus, many parents stressed by juggling work and child care from home had eased their restrictions on screen time for their children.Now it's even more likely that kids might find the video of George Floyd, an unarmed and handcuffed black man in Minneapolis, gasping for breath as a white police officer pressed a knee into his neck.Even if they haven't, experts say parents should assume their children are already aware of tragedies like these and their aftermath.""Children and adolescents are experiencing the collateral consequences of the publicized murderers of Breonna Taylor, Tony McDade, and George Floyd, whether they have a smartphone in their direct possession or not,"" said California pediatrician Dr. Rhea Boyd, who teaches nationally on the relationship between structural racism, inequity and health.""Whether from social media accounts, conversations with peers or caregivers, overheard conversations, or the distress they witness in the faces of those they love, children know what is going on,"" Boyd said. ""And without the guidance and validation of their caregivers, they may be navigating their feelings alone.""Take care of you firstHow can a parent help their child traverse these disturbing times?Let the child's age and level of development guide you, experts say, but first, be sure that you are in the right frame of mind.""A parent's first step is to take care of themselves, their mental health, their emotional health. Put their oxygen mask on first before they put the oxygen mask on their child,"" said Chicago pediatrician Dr. Nia Heard-Garris, who chairs the minority health, equity and inclusion committee of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP).""Vicarious trauma through screens is real, especially for marginalized communities who may have experienced similar actions first-hand,"" said Dr. Jenny Radesky, a developmental behavioral pediatrician who teaches at the University of Michigan.The stress of watching traumatic events on television and smartphones ""lingers within our bodies and minds,"" Radesky added. She suggests parents find ways to channel that energy with positive actions, such as deep breathing and re-grounding exercises, before playing with or talking to your kids.""This doesn't mean letting go of the anger or anxiety, it just means organizing it better so you can think and act more clearly,"" she said.Once a parent is fully available to be a calm, rational voice, ""then you can parse out what's important to pass onto your child so that you're not oversharing information that may further traumatize them or make them feel insecure or unsafe,"" Heard-Garris said.Infants and toddlersWhile children younger than three aren't going to understand what is happening on television, they will be able to pick up on the ""fear, urgency, or anger in people's voices and behaviors,"" Radesky said.At this age, stress shows up in fussy or unregulated behavior. To keep that from occurring, parents should read, listen to or watch the news when the baby isn't physically there.""Watch what you need to stay informed about your community, but then turn it off and do something that makes your family feel connected and whole,"" Radesky said. ""You may need to re-ground yourself or regulate your thoughts and feelings before re-engaging with your kids.""This is the time to begin teaching your child about systemic racism and how to identify and refute it, experts say.Racist stereotypes and bias begin at a shockingly young age.As early as six months, a baby's brain can notice race-based differences, and can internalize racial bias by ages two to four, said Maryland pediatrician Dr. Jacqueline Dougé, who co-authored the AAP's statement on the impact of racism on child and adolescent health.""Learning"" racism is a lot like learning a new language for babies and toddlers, wrote Dougé and California pediatrician Dr. Ashaunta Anderson in a separate commentary. It can happen without parental input, just by the racial stereotypes so prevalent in society.By age 12, many children become set in their beliefs. That gives parents ""a decade to mold the learning process, so that it decreases racial bias and improves cultural understanding,"" they wrote.While helpful for all races, it's especially important for white children to see brown and black kids in a positive light to fight systemic racism, experts say. Books that profile multi-racial characters are an excellent way for parents to do that. And since it's never too early to read to a baby, start right away.Common Sense Media, a nonprofit that rates movies, TV shows, books, apps and other media for parents and schools, has curated a list of 80 books with diverse, multi-cultural characters for preschoolers and older, some of which could easily be suitable for babies and toddlers.""There's also a website called the Brown Bookshelf,"" said Heard-Garris. ""These are books that have, brown and black protagonists who deal at times with tough issues. I think books are really, really fundamental, especially for younger kids.""Preschool and elementary agesThis is the age when kids begin to ask questions on why other people look different than they do.""If your child asks about someone's skin tone, you might say, 'Isn't it wonderful that we are all so different!' You can even hold your arm against theirs to show the differences in skin tones in your family,"" according to Dougé and Anderson.At this age, children will see and absorb disturbing images from protests and riots literally, ""likely focusing on worrying about a burning van or a scary-looking person in a mask,"" Radesky said.Parents should do their best to limit the exposure children this age have to media, whether television, smart phones or tablets, experts say.""This can be done by setting certain times that children can use their devices, co-view the content with their children, find other activities like playing outside, games, cooking together, set rules that kids should use the devices in a common area where parents can check in,"" Dougé said.""These times also provide opportunities for parents to model the behavior they want their kids to follow by also limiting their exposure to media,"" Dougé added.But as Boyd said, children will likely have already overheard adult conversations, or been exposed to what is happening via social media accounts and conversations with friends.""Parents who have not already, should proactively engage their kids around these distressing events,"" Boyd said. ""Ask them what they know and what they've seen. Ask them how they are feeling. Validate their feelings and let them know what you are doing to keep them safe -- be it in your home or your community.""Parents will also need to give their children the broader societal context of racism in order to try to explain the rage of protestors filling the streets of cities across the nation, Radesky said.By doing so, parents can help build empathy and teach perspective-taking, rather than focusing on the child's specific fears.""Instead of focusing on questions the child may have about concrete things, ask them questions like 'How do you think those people were feeling? Do you know why they were angry? What do you do when you feel like something is unfair?' "" Radesky said.""Providing a controlled space to understand what is going on and ways to process it will help children navigate the distressing emotions, helplessness and fear they may be experiencing,"" Boyd said.Age-appropriate books that deal with discrimination and explain feelings from different perspectives are extremely helpful during this time, experts say.""You can also show them videos of peaceful protests from the past, where people were inspired to demand fair treatment,"" said Radesky, while warning that some YouTube videos can contain intense political and disinformation ads occurring before and during videos.""Just skip those and start showing your young kids the Martin Luther King Jr. or other video once the ad has passed,"" Radesky suggested. ""For older children, you can ask them what they think of different ads and whether they're trustworthy.""'The talk'For black families, there is another, more painful necessity at this age, known as ""the talk."" It's a series of ""don'ts"" black families have passed on for generations: Don't resist police. Stay away from bad places. Be respectful to white people and stay away from confrontation with white men, especially police.""We're black folks, so we don't have a choice but to talk about race and talk about racism,"" said Heard-Garris, who has a 7-year-old son. ""So he can tell you probably more eloquently than I can about racism and he's seven.""She recalls with pain when he asked her if he would be the target of police violence at the tender age of four after he heard adults talk about a recent police shooting of an unarmed black man.""He said to me, 'Are police here to help me or do they shoot me? I thought they're supposed to keep me safe. I thought they were supposed to keep us safe.' And he was four,"" she related.""And so we had a long conversation about how police are supposed to keep us safe, and I assured him that as his mom, that's my job. 'My first job is to always keep you safe,' I told him.""""As he grows, I'm going to have to have a more frank conversation that, 'Unfortunately, you're going to do all the right things, but you might not be safe."" And that's going to be a hard day for us.""The recent deaths of Breonna Taylor, an EMT who was killed in March after officers forced their way inside her home; Ahmaud Arbery, the 25-year-old unarmed black man shot while taking a jog in rural Georgia in February; and now George Floyd's death, has many black parents afraid that ""the talk"" may not be enough.""The problem here is systemic racism and disregard for black lives,"" Heard-Garris said. ""And so as a doctor, I don't just treat a patient that has a fever when they have a bacterial infection, right?""I give them antibiotics. I don't just keep giving them Tylenol because that's not going to treat the infection. And I think as a country we need to treat the illness, which is systemic racism.""As Heard-Garris's story illustrates, when to begin ""the talk"" will be unique for each child and family, Boyd said.""For some, it may be earlier than expected, because evidence indicates black children in particular are often perceived as older and less innocent than they are. For black girls, this process of adultification can begin as young as age 5, and for black boys, it can begin by age 10,"" Boyd said.""Beginning 'the talk' with school-aged children can prepare them for these encounters before they occur and equip them with tools that can be life saving,"" Boyd added.As an African-American pediatrician, Boyd discusses the topic often with parents of children in her care. She advises black parents to think of ""the talk"" as more of a process than a singular conversation.""That process may begin with introducing stories through age-appropriate books or films that can generate questions you answer together. Or it can be an ongoing dialogue that is sparked by current events. Just remember to include specific guidance that enables your child to know their rights and the steps they can take to try and stay safe. And always be sure to let your child know it isn't fair they have to learn these lessons so young. But you are teaching then to try to keep them safe,"" Boyd said.White parents can have ""the talk"" too, Boyd said.""It's an important moment to build empathy with your child,"" she said. ""It is also important to highlight the other children who may have fears or concerns related to their safety, and to model and practice 'upstanding' or acting in defense of those around them.""Tweens and teensOf course, tweens and teens will likely be seeing all the coverage of police brutality and protests on their personal smartphones. Most teens get comfort by communicating with their friends on social media, Heard-Garris said. Some teens have even begun participating in online activism.""Online activism is a coping response for some adolescents, especially right now while we're physically distant,"" Heard-Garris said. ""Reposting, retweeting, expressing how they're feeling, chatting with friends has been helpful, sort of an active kind of coping response.""Other teens, especially those that are not of a minority background, so those that are white, are educating themselves about why this is happening, what's the history of our country, what's happening right now. Intellectualizing the issues has been helpful for them to understand this is not just a today problem, this has been going on for years,'"" Heard-Garris said.At this age, kids will be able to think more abstractly about racism, injustice and violent versus peaceful protest and discuss their views with parents, experts say.""Parents can ask their tweens or teens whether they've seen anything online about the riots and protests, what they think, and what about it was upsetting or inspiring,"" Radesky said.As the parent of any teenager will attest, direct questioning of teens often doesn't produce constructive responses.""I dunno,"" is a typical reaction, so Radesky suggests parents also try asking about the types of unfairness kids see or feel in their everyday lives.Parents can also make good use of movies and documentaries that can educate older teens on the history of discrimination. Common Sense Media has lists of movies that discuss racism or inspire kids to ""change the world,"" which can be used to jump start conversations about racism and how they can help fight it, Radesky said.""You don't need to preach to children about what is 'right' or 'wrong,'"" she said. ""It's better to have a conversation where they come to their own understanding and can see things in a larger social context.""Kira Banks, a clinical psychologist whose website ""Raising Equity"" provides free videos and resources on how parents can fight racism and cultivate an open mind in themselves and their kids, suggests parents watch movies like ""13th,"" a powerful look at institutional racism in the justice system that premiered in 2016 to a standing ovation at the New York Film Festival.""Is this a teachable moment? Absolutely. It must be, it has to be,"" Banks said. ""And if a person hasn't done the work to understand the history of racism and discrimination in America, they should do so, and then join us in raising our children to see and disrupt racism, and be the change we want to see.""The work must be done by all social classes and races, experts say, including the most privileged.""White and non-black families should not shield their older children from these images,"" Radesky said. ""We need to engage our children in a conversation about racism, and use these events as a catalyst.""While it is upsetting to watch, we need to sit with that discomfort and teach our families how to channel that energy to work to dismantle the racist structures that exist in our communities.""",0.0

Outside the White House on Friday, Secret Service could be seen after 7 p.m. taking at least one person into custody.

The driver of the truck was taken into custody, but not before protesters pulled him from the truck's cab. The driver was taken to the hospital with minor injuries.

DPS announced the arrests of more than 155 people Saturday night across multiple agencies. A dozen firearms were confiscated between the State Patrol and the Minneapolis Police Department.

The fire, apparently an act of arson, was in the basement of St. John's Church, across from the White House, The Washington Post reported, and was extinguished. It occurred as a demonstration was taking place outside. The gathering had attracted as many as 1,000 Sunday, who faced off against officers in riot gear. The Episcopalian church in Lafayette Square boasts on its website that every U.S. president since James Madison has attended services.

Pritzker said he activated 375 Illinois National Guard soldiers to assist local law enforcement with street closures.

Speaking at the site where Floyd died after fired police officer Derek Chauvin held his knee to Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes, Arradondo apologized to Floyd's family and said he had a ""visceral"" and ""emotional"" reaction to the video that has sparked outrage across the nation. “There are absolute truths in life,"" Arradondo told CNN. ""We need air to breathe. ... I did not need days or weeks or months or processes or bureaucracies to tell me what occurred out here last Monday, it was wrong.” When asked why he fired the four officers involved in the incident that led to Floyd's death, Arradondo said: ""In my mind, this was a violation of humanity. This was a violation of the oath the majority of the men and women that put this uniform on — this goes absolutely against it. This goes contrary to what we believe in.""

In the video, the people vandalize three police vehicles, smashing windows and hitting and kicking the vehicles. One of the people opens a door to the SUV and those at the scene start lighting things inside of it on fire. Police eventually got to the scene and began pushing back protesters as the vehicles burned behind them. Minnesota AG Keith Ellison to lead prosecution of Derek Chauvin Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz announced Sunday that state Attorney General Keith Ellison will lead the prosecution in the Floyd case. Ellison called the case “unusual because of the way that Mr. Floyd was killed and who did it — at the hands of the defendant who was a Minneapolis police officer.” He said he expects to work together with Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman on the case. Ellison didn’t announce additional charges for Chauvin or charges for the three other officers involved in the incident. He added “prosecuting police officers for misconduct, including homicide and murder, is very difficult.” “Every single link in the prosecutorial chain will come under attack as we present this case to a jury or a fact finder and we need to make sure that we be absolutely prepared.

The protests over George Floyd's death hit the nation's capital Friday night as angry protesters arrived at Pennsylvania Avenue, leading to a lockdown at the White House. Outside the White House on Friday, Secret Service could be seen after 7 p.m. taking at least one person into custody. Videos showed a large group of protesters gathering, with some burning flags and knocking over barricades. There were also some violent encounters. The president remained there about an hour before returning to the residence, according to a Republican close to the White House and an administration official who spoke to the Associated Press on the condition of anonymity. It is currently unknown whether first lady Melania Trump and their son, Barron, were with the president but the family has been shaken by the size and venom of the crowds, AP reported. ""The White House does not comment on security protocols and decisions,” said White House spokesman Judd Deere. The Secret Service said it does not discuss the means and methods of its protective operations. Officials told The New York Times, which first reported the story, they never believed Trump was in danger but took the precaution of moving him to the bunker as tensions escalated. Trump has told advisers he worries about his safety, while both privately and publicly praising the work of the Secret Service, according to the AP. Floyd, an unarmed black man, died in Minneapolis police custody this week after a white officer pinned him to the ground under his knee. His death has sparked demonstrations against police brutality and racial discrimination in cities across the United States. Trump praised the Secret Service and said he “watched every move” from inside the White House during Friday's protest and that he “couldn't have felt more safe.” ""They let the ‘protesters’ scream & rant as much as they wanted, but whenever someone got too frisky or out of line, they would quickly come down on them, hard – didn’t know what hit them,"" he said Saturday. Trump continued, ""The front line was replaced with fresh agents, like magic. Big crowd, professionally organized, but nobody came close to breaching the fence. If they had, they would have been greeted with the most vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons, I have ever seen. That’s when people would have been really badly hurt, at least."" He also claimed DC Mayor Muriel Bowser didn't allow DC police to ""get involved"" and assist Secret Service, though Secret Service later said they were on the scene. Bowser, a Democrat, said on Twitter the city's police department would protect everyone regardless of whether the mayor agreed with them. ""While he hides behind his fence afraid/alone, I stand w/ people peacefully exercising their First Amendment Right after the murder of #GeorgeFloyd & hundreds of years of institutional racism There are no vicious dogs & ominous weapons. There is just a scared man,"" she wrote. This is the same bunker Vice President Dick Cheney was brought after the September 11 attacks when authorities feared a hijacked plane hijacked was heading toward the White House. President George W.

Wait, I get it. The nationwide calls for justice, as Floyd's death was ruled, a homicide by both the Hennepin County Medical examiner and in an independent autopsy authorized by the family. The autopsy shows that Mr Floyd had no underlying medical problem that caused or contributed to his death. Cause of death, in my opinion, is that's fix CIA due to compression of the neck. But the Hennepin County medical examiner released its summary, saying Floyd died of cardiopulmonary arrest without explaining what caused his heart to stop overnight curfews enforced in cities in at least 20 states in Washington, D. C. And many stayed out late into the night instead of going home. Protests were largely peaceful across the nation and that some marches policed even joining the people in solidarity like in Atlanta, where some officers were seen taking a knee before renewed violence. But unrest and clashes between authorities and demonstrators were on display in many cities. Police firing tear gas into this crowd of protesters in Philadelphia, sending them scrambling off the highway. In Washington, a chaotic scene as police cleared this peaceful protest outside the White House has thousands of demonstrators marched together in New York City. Others looted some of midtown Manhattan's most iconic stores. Similar scenes playing out in Los Angeles with businesses broken into. Earlier in Minneapolis, Terrence Floyd for the first time visiting the very location, his brother took his last breaths, overwhelmed with emotion before saying this to Demonstrators.

Journalists covering the protest reported the crowd was largely peaceful at the time; the Park Police said they were responding to protesters throwing items, including bricks and frozen water bottles at law enforcement.Justice Department officials offered a different explanation, saying officers were carrying out Attorney General William Barr’s order to expand the security perimeter outside the White House.Officers repelled the crowd nearly 30 minutes ahead of a 7 p.m. curfew in Washington. Shortly after the crowd was pushed back, President Donald Trump walked through the park where they had gathered for a photo opportunity at a nearby church.--------------Hundreds of people were gathered peacefully tonight at the base of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C. — a mix of black and white, young and old, looked out toward the Washington Monument.Several dozen uniformed guardsmen and women, along with Park Police, were standing on the steps of the monument.There were speakers and prayers and signs, calling for justice and an end to police brutality.“Together we are more,” a speaker said.On a breezy spring evening in Washington, this scene illustrates the peaceful demonstration that is starkly at odds with violent rioting and looting.“Make it quick,” one man said, “curfew is coming up in 30 minutes.”The peaceful demonstration concluded when the 7 p.m. curfew in D.C. went into effect.ATLANTA — Six Atlanta police officers are being charged with using excessive force during an arrest of two college students at a protest on Saturday night, Fulton County District Attorney Paul Howard announced Tuesday.The officers were filmed in downtown Atlanta breaking windows of a vehicle, yanking a woman out of the car and tasing a man. The two victims were later identified as college students at Spellman and Morehouse, both historically black schools, and were returning from protests calling for an end to police violence against black citizens.Arrest warrants have been issued for Lonnie Hood, Willie Sauls, Ivory Streeter, Mark Gardner, Armond Jones and Roland Claud. Some of the charges against the officers include aggravated assault of Messiah Young, aggravated assault of Taniyah Pilgrim, simple battery and criminal damage to property, Howard said.Two of the six officers, Streeter and Gardner, were terminated Sunday by Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms.CHARLESTON, W.Va. — The West Virginia National Guard is pursuing disciplinary action against a guardsman who posted on social media that he would shoot at people protesting the death of George Floyd, officials said Tuesday.The guardsman, Noah Garcelon, has already resigned his position as an officer with the Winfield Police Department after making the comments. In a series of now-deleted posts, Garcelon wrote that he would “start firing live rounds” at protesters and “see how many I can run over before my car breaks down.”Maj. Gen. James Hoyer, who leads the state’s National Guard, said officials will be taking the appropriate disciplinary action related to Garcelon and any others “who make inflammatory comments related to protests going on across the nation.”Winfield Police Department Chief Ron Arthur said Garcelon acknowledged that he made the comments and stressed that he wasn’t a racist before resigning.West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice, a Republican, has urged people to remain peaceful but said he would not hesitate to call in the National Guard if demonstrations in the state became violent.PHILADELPHIA — Joe Biden in a speech on Tuesday condemned President Donald Trump over the use of tear gas against peaceful protesters outside the White House in order to clear a park so that the president could visit a church for a photo opportunity.""The president held up the Bible at St. John's Church yesterday. I just wish he opened it every once in a while instead of just brandishing it,"" the former vice president and presumptive Democratic 2020 nominee said in Philadelphia.Characterizing the moment as a ""battle for the soul of our nation"" — an echo of Biden's central campaign theme — Biden condemned Trump's actions Monday night, which played out on live television as protesters who had been chanting with their hands in the air were suddenly scattered throughout Washington's streets.""When peaceful protestors are dispersed by the order of the president from the doorstep of the people's house, the White House — using tear gas and flash grenades — in order to stage a photo op, a photo op, at one of the most historic churches in the country or at least Washington, DC, we can be forgiven for believing that the president is more interested in power than in principle,"" Biden said.LAS VEGAS — An officer has been shot in Las Vegas and authorities are responding to another shooting as people protest the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, authorities said.The officer was shot in the area of the Las Vegas Strip and an officer was involved in a shooting in the downtown area, according to the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department.The department said both shootings were on Las Vegas Boulevard.Protesters have been rallying for days across the country over the death of Floyd, who was seen on video pleading that he couldn’t breathe with a white police officer pressing his knee into his neck for several minutes before Floyd stopped moving.Police in Las Vegas said Monday that 338 people were arrested during three nights of protests. Police said suspects were jailed despite a local court policy calling for most people accused of misdemeanors to receive court summons to prevent the spread of coronavirus.ST. LOUIS —Police say four officers were hit by gunfire after protests in St. Louis that started peacefully Monday became violent overnight, with demonstrators smashing windows and stealing items from businesses and fires burning in the downtown area.The police department tweeted early Tuesday that the officers were taken to a hospital with injuries that were not believed to be life-threatening. It was unclear who had fired the shots.The chaos in St. Louis followed continued protests Monday in Missouri over the death of George Floyd and police treatment of African Americans, with gatherings also held in Kansas City and Jefferson City.On Monday afternoon, several hundred people rallied peacefully outside the justice center in downtown St. Louis, including Mayor Lyda Krewson and St. Louis Public Safety Director Jimmie Edwards. Protestors later walked to the Gateway Arch National Park and then onto nearby Interstate 64.But later Monday, protesters gathered in front of police headquarters, where officers fired tear gas. Some protesters smashed windows at a downtown 7-11 store and stole items from inside before the building was set on fire. CICERO, Ill. — Authorities in a Chicago suburb where two people were fatally shot in unrest following George Floyd’s death are issuing fresh safety precautions Tuesday.Cicero officials cautioned residents to “stay home and stay off the streets” a day after violence and destruction erupted in the town of about 84,000 west of Chicago. Police say most of Monday’s chaos stemmed from residents trying to defend businesses. Roughly 60 people were arrested, mostly for burglary and weapons violations.Two men in their 20s were fatally shot around 6 p.m. in separate incidents related to the violent clashes.

I want you to look and the place where so many people are coming to grief. This is the intersection where George Floyd had that horrific encounter with police today. We're expecting his brother, Terrence Floyd, to come out for a prayer to lay some flowers. Theo idea is to focus on George Floyd and not on the violence. It is going to be a day of grieving and an emotional day for this community. It was another night of protest and unrest in cities across the country, with incidents of violence from New York City to Los Angeles. For the boss has been knocked down. The ones who cast that up no more because they don't have a voice anymore, all sparked by the killing of 46 year old George Floyd, who died in police custody pleading for his life as an officer. At least 40 cities have enacted nighttime curfews, and more than a dozen states have deployed the National Guard. But not all demonstrations have been violent. In Minneapolis, demonstrators gathering at the intersection with Floyd encountered police to remember the Minneapolis police chief also took a knee at the site and acknowledged Police needs to do better for community members. Need to know that the men and women that put this badge on that they're doing so in service to them and they should not, and they should not have to doubt. They should not have to doubt thean integrity and if they're gonna be treated in a compassionate and professional weight. And the police chief also saying that all four of those officers bear the same responsibility. It is, of course, a welcome message. But the protesters continue to say and continue to call for all four officers to be criminally charged. Reporting in Minneapolis, I'm Camila Bernau Back to you. Advertisement Officials see extremist groups stoking violence and disinformation during protests Share Shares Copy Link Copy U.S. officials sought to determine Sunday whether extremist groups had infiltrated police brutality protests across the country and deliberately tipped largely peaceful demonstrations toward violence — and if foreign adversaries were behind a burgeoning disinformation campaign on social media.As demonstrations spread from Minneapolis to the White House, New York City and overseas, federal law enforcement officials insisted far-left groups were stoking violence. Meanwhile, experts who track extremist groups also reported seeing evidence of the far-right at work.Investigators were also tracking online interference and looking into whether foreign agents were behind the effort. Officials have seen a surge of social media accounts with fewer than 200 followers created in the last month, a textbook sign of a disinformation effort.The accounts have posted graphic images of the protests, material on police brutality and material on the coronavirus pandemic that appeared designed to inflame tensions across the political divide, according to three administration officials. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss investigations.The investigations are an attempt to identify the network of forces behind some of the most widespread outbreak of civil unrest in the U.S. in decades. Protests erupted in dozens of cities in recent days, triggered by the death of George Floyd, who died after he was pinned at the neck by a white Minneapolis police officer. Pandemic-weary Americans were already angry — about COVID-19 deaths, lockdown orders and tens of millions of people out of work. The pandemic has hit African Americans harder than whites in the U.S., and the killings of black people by police have continued over the years even as the topic faded from the national stage. But there are signs of people with other disparate motives, including anarchist graffiti, arrests of some out-of-state protesters, and images circulating in extremist groups that suggest the involvement of outside groups.Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said Sunday that state authorities were hit with a cyber attack as law enforcement prepared to diffuse protests in Minneapolis and St. Paul, the epicenter of the unrest. He described it as a ""very sophisticated denial of service attack on all computers."" President Donald Trump, Attorney General William Bar and others have said the left-wing extremist group antifa is to blame. Short for anti-fascists, antifa is an umbrella term for far-left-leaning militant groups that resist neo-Nazis and white supremacists at demonstrations.Barr on Sunday said the FBI would use its regional joint terrorism task forces to ""identify criminal organizers,"" and Trump threatened again to name antifa a terrorist group.The Justice Department is also deploying members of the U.S. Marshals Service and agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration on Sunday to supplement National Guard troops outside the White House, a senior department official said. The official was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.The addition of the federal agents, who will have armored vehicles, came as Barr warned that prosecutors could seek to use terrorism statutes against ""violent radical agitators"" who attempt to hijack protests to cause destruction. An antifa activist group disseminated a message in a Telegram channel on Saturday that encouraged people to consider Minnesota National Guard troops ""easy targets,"" two Defense Department officials said. The message encouraged activists to steal ""kit,"" meaning the weapons and body armor used by the soldiers. The officials were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.As a result, soldiers with the Minnesota National Guard were armed during their mission at protests across the state Sunday, the officials said. The soldiers are sometimes armed but had not been since they moved into parts of the state that had been besieged by riots in the last few days. The troops do not have the authority to make arrests, and are there to act mostly as extra security for police.Others have seen evidence of right-wing extremists. J.J. MacNab, a fellow at George Washington University's Program on Extremism, has been monitoring chatter about the protests among anti-government extremists on social media platforms. She has access to dozens of private Facebook groups for followers of the loosely organized ""Boogaloo"" movement, which uses an '80s movie sequel as a code word for a second civil war.She also has been poring over images from the weekend protests and spotted some ""boogaloo bois"" in the crowds, carrying high-powered rifles and wearing tactical gear.""They want to co-opt them in order to start their war. They see themselves as being on the side of protesters and that the protesters themselves are useful in causing anarchy,"" MacNab said.She also sees signs that the Three Percenters militia movement appears to be taking an interest.Megan Squire, an Elon University computer science professor who tracks online extremism, saw images of at least four members of the far-right Proud Boys group on the periphery of a protest Saturday night in Raleigh, North Carolina.Trump was expected in the coming days to draw distinctions between the legitimate anger of peaceful protesters and the unacceptable actions of violent agitators, said a White House official who was not authorized to discuss the plans ahead of time and spoke on condition of anonymity.The Trump administration has largely remained silent on local reports that far-right protesters were also involved. Meanwhile, Democratic mayors said Trump's handling of the crisis was reminiscent of one of the darkest moments of his presidency — when he said there were ""good people on both sides"" of protests in 2017 over white supremacists demonstrating in Charlottesville, Virginia.America's racial fault lines are a perfect opportunity for foreign adversaries looking to sow discord and portray the U.S. in a negative light, according to James Ludes, director of the Pell Center for International Relations and Public Policy at Salve Regina University in Rhode Island.""This is a real issue and Americans are legitimately upset about it,"" said Ludes, who studies foreign disinformation tactics. ""That's one of the hallmarks of these campaigns. You don't create new issues, you exploit existing issues.""There's a history of this. In 2016, another black man, Philando Castile, was killed by police in a Minneapolis suburb, his death livestreamed on Facebook.Russians used a fake Black Lives Matter page to confuse and stoke anger among the protesters. There were nearly 700,000 followers, but it's not clear how many were real. One debunked example from this week: That Atlanta had deployed a ""child militia."" Floyd was accused of trying to pass a bad bill at a grocery store after he was laid off in the pandemic. Disturbing video showed him prone on the street, while a white police officer pressed his knee into Floyd's neck even as he cried he couldn't breathe. He later died. The officers have been fired; Derek Chauvin, the officer who pinned Floyd in the video, was charged with murder. At first there were peaceful demonstrations, but violence soon erupted. A Minneapolis police station was torched and protests took off around the country, growing increasingly tense. Video showed a police vehicle ramming into demonstrators in New York. Meanwhile, a van with four New York Police Department officers inside was hit with a Molotov cocktail and torched. Hundreds have been arrested nationwide and cities braced for more protests. But booking information from the county jail in Minneapolis, for example, showed that out of 59 protest-related arrests, 47 people had a home address in Minnesota, with the majority coming from the Twin Cities.Before protests began in New York City, organizers of anarchist groups began raising money for bail, recruited medical teams to deploy for violent interactions with police and planned how to target high-end stores, said John Miller, the NYPD's deputy commissioner of intelligence and counterterrorism. Scouts on bicycles would also move ahead of the groups to report where the police would be and then direct small breakaway groups to areas where they could torch police cars or throw Molotov cocktails, Miller said. The NYPD has arrested 786 people related to protests since May 28 and 1 in 7 of them were not from New York City, he said. In Washington, where protesters raged outside the White House, most of the 17 people arrested were from the area. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser said the groups seemed, at the least, organized to destroy with tools to break windows and distribute materials.",0.0

The antifa groups are decidedly anti-racist, anti-sexist and anti-homophobia, but also by and large socially leftist and anti-capitalist. How do the groups operate? Mark Bray, a lecturer and Dartmouth and author of the new book Antifa: The Antifascist Handbook, says the groups ""organize educational campaigns, build community coalitions, monitor fascists, pressure venues to cancel their events, organize self-defense trainings and physically confront the far right when necessary."" A main goal is to try to deny fascists a public forum, which is why they turn out in numbers to physically confront neo-Nazis, the KKK and white supremacists at public demonstrations. They also step in to protect counter-protesters at such events. In addition, antifa is particularly active in ""doxxing,"" or identifying neo-Nazis and like-minded individuals and disseminating that private information to the public and employers to discourage people from joining their ranks. Is antifa violent?

""We are unapologetic about the reality that fighting fascism at points requires physical militancy,” Rose City Antifa’s Facebook page reads. “Anti-fascism is, by nature, a form of self-defense: the goal of fascism is to exterminate the vast majority of human beings.” Political activist and author Cornel West, speaking to Amy Goodman on the program Democracy Now about the clashes in Charlottesville, said antifa intervened when the ""neofascists"" move against his group of protesters. ""We would have been crushed like cockroaches if it were not for the anarchists and the anti-fascists,"" he said. Bray says the rise of fascism in the 1930s demonstrates that it was a mistake to allow such groups to air their views in hopes that public opinion would blunt their growth. ""We should be wary of those who are more distressed about alleged violations of the speech of fascists than the actual violence they perpetrate,"" he says. Where has the movement demonstrated? In addition to Charlottesville, antifa forces, who often dress in black and wear masks, have confronted or clashed with far-right groups in such places as the University of California at Berkeley, where protests by West Coast antifa forces, some of whom smashed windows and set fires, forced the cancellation of a speech by alt-right activist Milo Yiannopoulos in February and another by conservative commentator Ann Coulter in April. In June, antifa forces turned out to protest a pro-Trump free-speech in Portland.

1622410179,2020-06-01 10:51:55,What is antifa and what does the movement want?,https://www.seacoastonline.com/zz/news/20200601/what-is-antifa-and-what-does-movement-want?rssfeed=true,en,False,,662008,Exeter News Letter,http://www.seacoastonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/section?Category=NEWS11,"Antifa — short for ""anti-fascist"" — is the name for loosely affiliated, left-leaning anti-racist groups that monitor and track the activities of local neo-Nazis. The movement has no unified structure or national leadership but has emerged in the form of local bodies nationwide, particularly on the West Coast. Some of the groups, such as the 10-year-old Rose City Antifa in Portland, the oldest antifa group in the U.S., are particularly well-organized and active online and on Facebook, while its members are individually anonymous. President Trump has singled out antifa as part of what he calls the alt-left in his initial claim that ""many sides"" were to blame for violence in Charlottesville the weekend of Aug. 12, not just the neo-Nazis, KKK and white nationalists. How is it pronounced? ""AN-tifa"" with the emphasis on the first syllable, which sounds more like ""on"" in English than ""an."" When did it start? Anti-fascist groups, particularly in Europe, have been around for many decades, notably in Italy, against Mussolini, and in Germany, against Hitler. In the postwar period, antifa groups resurged to fight neo-Nazi groups, particularly in Germany. In the U.S., the anti-fascist movements grew out of leftist politics of the late '80s, primarily under the umbrella of Anti-Racist Action. What does the movement want? The primary goal is to stop neo-Nazis and white supremacists from gaining a platform rather than to promote a specific antifa agenda. The antifa groups are decidedly anti-racist, anti-sexist and anti-homophobia, but also by and large socially leftist and anti-capitalist. How do the groups operate? Mark Bray, a lecturer and Dartmouth and author of the new book Antifa: The Antifascist Handbook, says the groups ""organize educational campaigns, build community coalitions, monitor fascists, pressure venues to cancel their events, organize self-defense trainings and physically confront the far right when necessary."" A main goal is to try to deny fascists a public forum, which is why they turn out in numbers to physically confront neo-Nazis, the KKK and white supremacists at public demonstrations. They also step in to protect counter-protesters at such events. In addition, antifa is particularly active in ""doxxing,"" or identifying neo-Nazis and like-minded individuals and disseminating that private information to the public and employers to discourage people from joining their ranks. Is antifa violent? Members pointedly do not eschew violence but rather see themselves as engaging in ""self-defense,"" protecting other protesters and primarily confronting neo-Nazis and white supremacists to deny them a platform to publicly spread their views. ""We are unapologetic about the reality that fighting fascism at points requires physical militancy,” Rose City Antifa’s Facebook page reads. “Anti-fascism is, by nature, a form of self-defense: the goal of fascism is to exterminate the vast majority of human beings.” Political activist and author Cornel West, speaking to Amy Goodman on the program Democracy Now about the clashes in Charlottesville, said antifa intervened when the ""neofascists"" move against his group of protesters. ""We would have been crushed like cockroaches if it were not for the anarchists and the anti-fascists,"" he said. Bray says the rise of fascism in the 1930s demonstrates that it was a mistake to allow such groups to air their views in hopes that public opinion would blunt their growth. ""We should be wary of those who are more distressed about alleged violations of the speech of fascists than the actual violence they perpetrate,"" he says. Where has the movement demonstrated?

Smoke continued to waft in the air 24 hours after people protesting the death of George Floyd lit fire to Moore's storefront, and several others along Lake Street. ""My business burned down two days ago, you see the flames? It's still going,"" Moore, 41, said Sunday. ""That flame down in people's soul? It's still going. They want justice."" She is among dozens of Minneapolis and St. Paul business owners, small and large, trying to rebuild after fiery riots and demonstrations in the Twin Cities on Thursday and Friday. Her company, ""Levels,"" which also has a St. Paul location that remains undamaged, was Moore's ""baby."" Moore, a black woman, said she started the business from the trunk of her car once she left a job with Minneapolis Public Schools in 2011 to pursue her passion for fashion and music. It had been opened for five years before people broke in Friday and started a fire that destroyed her business and several adjacent stores. When she was alerted to the break-in, Moore went to Lake Street and watched nearly a decade of work collapse into the concrete. ""I'm hurt that I lost this. But ... I can't cry right now,"" she said. ""I can't go home and cry and be hurt because I lost businesses. George Floyd lost his life. He'll never be here again."" She's confident she can recover but isn't sure if she can rebuild at the same location — in the heart of a diverse southside neighborhood. A GoFundMe has been started to help with those expenses. Other small businesses face similar uncertainty, but several fundraisers have been started to help support Minneapolis' littlest companies. As looters ransacked his St. Paul store, this business owner hid in the bathroom and whispered to 911 In St. Paul's Midway neighborhood, just blocks from where Moore's second Levels location was protected by armed men standing on its porch, one business owner said he hid in his office as people ransacked, urinated in and damaged the building. Jim Segal closed Ax-Man Surplus earlier than normal Thursday afternoon because daylight looting took hold at the nearby intersection of University and Snelling avenues. After sending customers and employees home and locking the front door, Segal said he continued to work in the office of the six-decade-old company. Then he heard multiple glass windows break. ""Luckily, I have a steel door because they were trying to enter the office,"" said Segal, who bought the surplus store about 20 years ago. ""I don't think they knew anybody was in there, but I basically barricaded myself within a bathroom inside the office."" He felt as if he were in a movie, the St. Paul native said. As display cases were shattered and electronics taken from inside his store, he whispered to 911 dispatch asking for help. ""Police said, 'Don't even bother boarding up your store,'"" Segal said Saturday. ""'There's a 50/50 chance it won't be here tomorrow."" About 6:30 p.m. Thursday, he returned to the St. Paul Ax-Man location, one of three in the metro, in an unsuccessful effort to shoo away people running in and out of his store. A company agreed to board up his windows, Segal said, but left quickly after arriving, not wanting to work amongst the crowd. He tried to get a license plate of someone stealing, but others tried to take his phone so he retreated to his car. Segal sat in his vehicle for hours as rioters peed in his store and took items ranging from knick-knacks and DVDs to a snow-blower. He said coronavirus concerns forced him to close his business for the better part of two months. They'd been reopened a little more than a week when the building was ransacked. ""I don't recall ever being in a situation where I was that panicked. I was petrified, actually,"" he said. Ax-Man won't reopen for at least a week or two, and Segal fears it may close permanently because of the lack of sales during the spring. That would mean a loss of livelihood for him and about 10 employees. He sympathizes with those upset about Floyd's death in police custody on Memorial Day, describing the video of Minneapolis police officers' actions ""horrific."" ""This is just stuff, no comparison (to a person dying),"" said Segal, a white man. ""But what I'm disappointed about is the lack of leadership in the government — Mayor (Melvin) Carter, Mayor (Jacob) Frey, Gov. (Tim) Walz — to just allow lawlessness. ""Indefensible what happened to Mr. Floyd, but this doesn't make it better. And I don't know what does."" Insurance helps small business owners, but a full recovery is 'a lot more complicated' While Moore and Segal both said they are insured, they don't believe insurance alone will enough to replace everything they've lost. People typically see business owner and think ""wealth,"" Segal said. ""That's not true for me,"" he said. ""I'm the last one to get paid."" Understanding insurance policies can be difficult for many small business owners, said Allison Sharkey, executive director of the Lake Street Council, which supports local companies. Lake Street has always been an area for Minneapolis's immigrant entrepreneurs to start businesses, she said, and many of those folks may not be familiar with aid systems or insurance proceedings. ""There's a lot of detail to go through in your contract that most people don't really understand until a situation like this happens,"" Sharkey said. ""It's a lot more complicated than just paying a $500 deductible and thinking the rest is going to be covered."" Minority business owners may not have the credit or assets to withstand closures as long as white business owners with more resources, she said. The council, and other metro business associations like it, try to fill that gap and provide guidance, but insurance claims won't stop some businesses from completely fading away. For Moore, she's frustrated when people bring up the fact she's insured because it ignores the work she put into the building and the items she won't get back. ""When you get it out the mud — meaning when you get it on your own, no handouts ... someone just handing you money doesn't equate,"" she said. ""It's deeper than that."" Financial support is coming for Twin Cities small businesses left in rubble amid George Floyd protests When Segal returned to his business Friday, he found a person who lived nearby sweeping glass from the sidewalk, which raised his spirits. Monetary support has begun, too. It's especially vital, small business advocates say, because many companies were already running out of money because of closures due to COVID-19. The Lake Street Council has received over $1.5 million to help support the hundreds of businesses that line the heavily damaged area. Sharkey said companies owned by people of color and immigrants have been especially affected by the days of unrest. Several ""big, beautiful"" buildings on the southside have been replaced by rubble, which will be eventually replaced by vacant lots. ""($1.5 million) sounds like a big number, but we're gonna need a lot more government and nonprofit support,"" Sharkey said. ""We have a long road ahead of us."" She said her organization had already begun to save money to distribute to companies dealing with financial contractions from the coronavirus, but it's not been shifted to riot recovery. The council will request an aid package from the state, but Sharkey thinks they'll need federal dollars as well. ""We're headed toward a recession,"" she said. ""We're really going to have to create a long-term strategy along with stakeholders, business owners, property owners business groups, elected officials."" Donations to that fund can be made here. Fundraising has begun in Segal's area, as well. The Hamline Midway Coalition has received more than $75,000 to help aid small businesses in their recovery from property damage and lost sales. Kate Mudge, the coalition's director, said the organization has been raising funds to help small and minority business owners worried about gentrification and corporatization coming with the new U.S. soccer stadium built nearby. ""We already have been dealing with a pandemic, we've been dealing with some long-term issues in our community, and this is the icing on the cake. We hope that this is gonna bring new people to Midway, new businesses,"" she said. ""We've dealt with worse."" Donations to the Midway fund can be made at here. Despite the uncertainty, the organizations are confident many businesses will survive if community support keeps up. ""I'm not blaming people, you can't judge anybody's pain or anger. Everyone acts and reacts to things in different ways,"" Moore said. ""I have a black-owned business, it was burned down and we were protesting, for a black man's life that was taken. So, I was just a little confused on where we're going with this. But, at the end of the day, everything is about sacrifices.""",0.0

Financial support is coming for Twin Cities small businesses left in rubble amid George Floyd protests When Segal returned to his business Friday, he found a person who lived nearby sweeping glass from the sidewalk, which raised his spirits. Monetary support has begun, too. It's especially vital, small business advocates say, because many companies were already running out of money because of closures due to COVID-19. The Lake Street Council has received over $1.5 million to help support the hundreds of businesses that line the heavily damaged area.

Smoke continued to waft in the air 24 hours after people protesting the death of George Floyd lit fire to Moore's storefront, and several others along Lake Street. ""My business burned down two days ago, you see the flames? It's still going,"" Moore, 41, said Sunday. ""That flame down in people's soul? It's still going. They want justice."" She is among dozens of Minneapolis and St. Paul business owners, small and large, trying to rebuild after fiery riots and demonstrations in the Twin Cities on Thursday and Friday. Her company, ""Levels,"" which also has a St. Paul location that remains undamaged, was Moore's ""baby."" Moore, a black woman, said she started the business from the trunk of her car once she left a job with Minneapolis Public Schools in 2011 to pursue her passion for fashion and music. It had been opened for five years before people broke in Friday and started a fire that destroyed her business and several adjacent stores. When she was alerted to the break-in, Moore went to Lake Street and watched nearly a decade of work collapse into the concrete. ""I'm hurt that I lost this. But ... I can't cry right now,"" she said. ""I can't go home and cry and be hurt because I lost businesses. George Floyd lost his life. He'll never be here again."" She's confident she can recover but isn't sure if she can rebuild at the same location — in the heart of a diverse southside neighborhood. A GoFundMe has been started to help with those expenses. Other small businesses face similar uncertainty, but several fundraisers have been started to help support Minneapolis' littlest companies. As looters ransacked his St. Paul store, this business owner hid in the bathroom and whispered to 911 In St. Paul's Midway neighborhood, just blocks from where Moore's second Levels location was protected by armed men standing on its porch, one business owner said he hid in his office as people ransacked, urinated in and damaged the building. Jim Segal closed Ax-Man Surplus earlier than normal Thursday afternoon because daylight looting took hold at the nearby intersection of University and Snelling avenues. After sending customers and employees home and locking the front door, Segal said he continued to work in the office of the six-decade-old company. Then he heard multiple glass windows break. ""Luckily, I have a steel door because they were trying to enter the office,"" said Segal, who bought the surplus store about 20 years ago. ""I don't think they knew anybody was in there, but I basically barricaded myself within a bathroom inside the office."" He felt as if he were in a movie, the St. Paul native said. As display cases were shattered and electronics taken from inside his store, he whispered to 911 dispatch asking for help. ""Police said, 'Don't even bother boarding up your store,'"" Segal said Saturday. ""'There's a 50/50 chance it won't be here tomorrow."" About 6:30 p.m. Thursday, he returned to the St. Paul Ax-Man location, one of three in the metro, in an unsuccessful effort to shoo away people running in and out of his store. A company agreed to board up his windows, Segal said, but left quickly after arriving, not wanting to work amongst the crowd. He tried to get a license plate of someone stealing, but others tried to take his phone so he retreated to his car. Segal sat in his vehicle for hours as rioters peed in his store and took items ranging from knick-knacks and DVDs to a snow-blower. He said coronavirus concerns forced him to close his business for the better part of two months. They'd been reopened a little more than a week when the building was ransacked. ""I don't recall ever being in a situation where I was that panicked. I was petrified, actually,"" he said. Ax-Man won't reopen for at least a week or two, and Segal fears it may close permanently because of the lack of sales during the spring. That would mean a loss of livelihood for him and about 10 employees. He sympathizes with those upset about Floyd's death in police custody on Memorial Day, describing the video of Minneapolis police officers' actions ""horrific."" ""This is just stuff, no comparison (to a person dying),"" said Segal, a white man. ""But what I'm disappointed about is the lack of leadership in the government — Mayor (Melvin) Carter, Mayor (Jacob) Frey, Gov. (Tim) Walz — to just allow lawlessness. ""Indefensible what happened to Mr. Floyd, but this doesn't make it better. And I don't know what does."" Insurance helps small business owners, but a full recovery is 'a lot more complicated' While Moore and Segal both said they are insured, they don't believe insurance alone will enough to replace everything they've lost. People typically see business owner and think ""wealth,"" Segal said. ""That's not true for me,"" he said. ""I'm the last one to get paid."" Understanding insurance policies can be difficult for many small business owners, said Allison Sharkey, executive director of the Lake Street Council, which supports local companies. Lake Street has always been an area for Minneapolis's immigrant entrepreneurs to start businesses, she said, and many of those folks may not be familiar with aid systems or insurance proceedings. ""There's a lot of detail to go through in your contract that most people don't really understand until a situation like this happens,"" Sharkey said.

Most demonstrations, some attracting hundreds of people, were peaceful though violence, including the burning of police vehicles and looting, prompted police in some cities to deploy tear gas to gain control of the crowd. Early in the day, volunteers turned out in many cities to sweep up debris from businesses that had been burned, had their windows broken or were otherwise damaged Saturday. Here's a look at how protests are unfolding around the country on Sunday: Washington, D.C.: Historic St. John's Church near White House set ablaze As protesters gathered near the White House, flames were seen at the Washington, D.C., landmark that bills itself as ""the church of the presidents."" The fire, apparently an act of arson, was in the basement of St. John's Church, across from the White House, The Washington Post reported, and was extinguished. It occurred as a demonstration was taking place outside. The gathering had attracted as many as 1,000 Sunday, who faced off against officers in riot gear. The Episcopalian church in Lafayette Square boasts on its website that every U.S. president since James Madison has attended services there. Consecrated in 1816, the church also says the bell in its steeple, weighing almost 1,000 pounds, was cast in 1822 by Paul Revere's son Joseph. New York City: Protesters force closure of Manhattan Bridge; street fires, looting A crucial bridge into Manhattan was closed Sunday to make way for protesters, a day after hundreds of arrests including the mayor's daughter, it was reported. Street fires were being set and sporadic looting was reported Sunday evening after a day that saw large groups of protesters walk from Brooklyn to Manhattan over the Manhattan Bridge, which had to be closed, ABC7 in New York reported. Mayor Bill de Blasio's daughter Chiara, 25, was among 345 arrested, the station reported based on unnamed NYPD sources. The Daily Mail said it was able to confirm the arrest from a police report. She was reportedly arrested as part of a group of 100 demonstrators who refused to leave a roadway when ordered by police. Seattle: National Guard called to Bellevue; protesters block Interstate 5 National Guard troops were ordered to the Seattle suburb of Bellevue after reports of widespread looting. Washington Gov. Jay Inslee ordered 200 National Guard members to Bellevue after the mayor declared an emergency due to violence. Rioters broke into the Bellevue Mall and were stealing goods from stores. The thefts were part of a day of protests in the Seattle area that included shutting down Interstate 5, the same freeway that San Diego demonstrators blocked more than 1,000 miles away in southern California. Chicago: Gov. JB Pritzker activates National Guardsmen to assist police Vandalism reports continued to crop up in several city neighborhoods and some suburbs. The communities of Tinley Park, Crestwood and Oak Lawn alerted residents to stay home due to civil unrest. Many businesses boarded up. Gov. J.B. Pritzker said he activated 375 Illinois National Guard soldiers to assist local law enforcement with street closures. The downtown Chicago demonstrations that drew thousands started peacefully Saturday afternoon in a plaza, with protesters reading the names of black people who have died at the hands of police. But that gave way to violence and destruction that continued overnight Sunday in Chicago and elsewhere. Police used batons to beat back demonstrators as police cars were set ablaze and windows were smashed at businesses ranging from neighborhood convenience stores to high-end Michigan Avenue shops. Santa Monica, California: Unchecked looting as marchers confront police Looters took advantage of a large demonstration several blocks away to hit stores in the city's business district. In late afternoon, police were met with resistance when they tried to end a demonstration that had been peaceful. Demonstrators constructed a makeshift barricade in the middle of a street to protect themselves from non-lethal rounds fired by officers. The march had attracted hundreds along the city's main oceanfront boulevard. Though there were many police officers present for the march, looters were able to plunder stores with few to stop them. Cars were seen pulling up in front of stores, with looters running in to collect bundles of clothes and other merchandise, then running out. Boxes littered the sidewalk as thieves were seen transferring goods into plastic trash bags. A 5:30 p.m. PST curfew was announced due to the protests. The looting came despite the arrival of the National Guard troops in neighboring Los Angeles, which had seen extensive looting, vandalism and arson on Saturday. Murfreesboro, Tennessee: Brick thrown into business, police use tear gas A small but tense demonstration in Murfreesboro, Tennessee, appeared to have dispersed after demonstrators blocked traffic and threw a brick through the window of a local business, prompting police to respond with canisters of tear gas. About 50 protesters, many of whom appeared to be Middle Tennessee State University students, marched from Main Street toward Forrest Hall, a campus building named for Confederate general and Ku Klux Klan founder Nathan Bedford Forrest. Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee said protests in Murfreesboro are now “overt threats to public safety and property.” Police said an armored vehicle was vandalized and protesters have blocked traffic by lying in the street in an intersection. Officers responded by throwing canisters of tear gas to drive protesters out of the street. However, before the protest escalated, negotiations between police and protest leaders led to calm, then students and officers were seen walking together and posing for photos. – Nancy DeGennaro, Joseph Spears, Mealand Ragland-Hudgins and Brinley Hineman, Murfreesboro Daily News Journal Savannah, Georgia: Protesters chant 'Arrest the other three' during rally Thousands demonstrated against racism and the killings of black people at the hands of police Sunday in Savannah, Georgia. City leaders joined protesters who peacefully marched from Johnson Square to City Hall. “We need to make sure that we stop apologizing and we move from apology to action,” Savannah Police Chief Roy Minter said. At one point during Mayor Van Johnson’s speech, the crowd broke into a chant of “arrest the other three,” referring to other Minneapolis police officers who stood by while an officer knelt on Floyd’s neck. “Yeah, they should arrest the other three,” Johnson said. “We are tired of the mess and we want it to stop now. We stand here as a united community to say that we are standing with George Floyd and his family, because no man should ever have to die like that,” Johnson said. “We stand here united as a community to say that crooked police officers are called criminals. And in jail, they should be.” – Will Peebles, Dennis Knight, Mary Landers, Nathan Dominitz and Zach Dennis, Savannah Morning News San Diego: Police fire tear gas after being assaulted by rocks and bottles San Diego Police said they fired tear gas canisters Sunday after rocks and bottles were thrown at them. The department said in a series of tweets that the confrontation was taking place at Second Avenue and Broadway in the seaside city's downtown. ""Certain protestors continue to throw objects and vandalize our city,"" the department said in one post. ""The criminal behavior of these few is unacceptable. We are continuing to order the crowd to disperse."" Earlier, however, the department praised the peacefulness of most demonstrators. But it said it had to issue the order to disperse because of the dangerous actions of a few. At one point, demonstrators occupied Interstate 5, stopping traffic in both directions, the San Diego Union-Tribune reported. Philadelphia: Mayor Jim Kenney 'saddened and disappointed' beyond words Another day of street protests gave way to looting, with at least one police vehicle set on fire. Looters were running out of stores in the northeastern section of the city with armloads of merchandise. In the downtown, workers and volunteers swept up broken glass from windows shattered during riots the previous day. Graffiti was being removed. Mayor Jim Kenney said the mayhem “saddened and disappointed me beyond words, and I’m sure it saddened every Philadelphian who takes pride in their city.” He said those responsible “not only desecrated private businesses, they also desecrated the important message that was heard in the earlier peaceful protests.” Spartanburg, South Carolina: Passing motorists show support for protesters Chanting “No justice, no peace,” about 100 peaceful Spartanburg, South Carolina, protesters gathered at Barnet Park, drawing support from motorists who honked their car horns. “We want to take a peaceful stand to show support,” said organizer Kelvin Brown. “If we can all come together as a people, black and white, we can make a difference.” Many protesters said it wasn’t just Floyd’s death at the hand of a white police officer, or that it took days before the officer was arrested, that triggered anger. “We need to end the racist system,” said Curtis Pickens. “If you want all this to stop, real justice is what is needed. Stop the racial and social profiling. Stop hiring white supremacist officers.” “It’s time to stand up for what we believe in,” Isaiah Jordan said. “What happened to George Floyd terrorizes the whole nation. We’ve got to do something about it. I’m just sick and tired of young, black men dying."" --Bob Montgomery, GoUpstate.com Lafayette, Louisiana: Protesters want police to know 'we're human' Hundreds of protesters, some wearing protective face coverings, lined Lafayette streets to join a peaceful demonstration against police brutality. The protest, peaceful like others in Baton Rouge and New Orleans this weekend, began in the morning with protesters lining the streets to chant. “I am sick and tired of being sick and tired,” Lafayette NAACP President Marja Broussard said to protesters. “I have a message for law enforcement. The message is: we want you to know that we’re human just like you...We want you to know we have families. We’re human.” – William Taylor Potter, Lafayette Daily Advertiser Augusta, Georgia: Demonstrators chant 'No justice, no peace' Demonstrators chanted “no justice, no peace” as they walked along Washington Road in Augusta, Georgia. While “No justice, no peace,” was a popular chant among protesters, Sunday’s peaceful march was about showing strength through peace rather than through violence, organizers said. Latoya Lovett said she asked the Street Justice Council to help her organize the marches after hearing many Augusta residents talk about going to Atlanta to join protests there, which have turned violent after peaceful starts. “You can march in your own city, you can have a voice in your own city,” Lovett said. “You don’t have to go smash windows, you don’t have to go beat people, you don’t have to drop on the police.” Demonstrators were escorted by Richmond County Sheriff’s Office deputies who blocked off roads and intersections as needed. Sheriff Richard Roundtree was among those who helped guide the marchers and ensure safety for both them and the motorists. “We believe in free speech and protesting and voicing your opinion, as long as you do it in a safe manner,” Roundtree said. “As long as you’re doing that, we’re all for it.” – Will Cheney and Miguel Legoas, The Augusta Chronicle Jacksonville, Florida: Peaceful rally follows violent Saturday night of protests A peaceful demonstration was held Sunday outside the Duval County Courthouse. Then protesters started moving downtown and Jacksonville, Florida, police worked to keep them in certain areas. The cleanup of smashed store windows began Sunday around Florida after a night of unrest throughout the state’s cities. Jacksonville Sheriff Mike Williams said an unnamed deputy was either stabbed or slashed in the neck and was taken to a hospital for treatment Saturday night. A sheriff’s office spokeswoman would not comment on the deputy’s condition Sunday morning.

Most demonstrations, some attracting hundreds of people, were peaceful though violence, including the burning of police vehicles and looting, prompted police in some cities to deploy tear gas to gain control of the crowd. Early in the day, volunteers turned out in many cities to sweep up debris from businesses that had been burned, had their windows broken or were otherwise damaged Saturday. Here's a look at how protests are unfolding around the country on Sunday: Washington, D.C.: Historic St. John's Church near White House set ablaze As protesters gathered near the White House, flames were seen at the Washington, D.C., landmark that bills itself as ""the church of the presidents."" The fire, apparently an act of arson, was in the basement of St. John's Church, across from the White House, The Washington Post reported, and was extinguished. It occurred as a demonstration was taking place outside. The gathering had attracted as many as 1,000 Sunday, who faced off against officers in riot gear. The Episcopalian church in Lafayette Square boasts on its website that every U.S. president since James Madison has attended services there. Consecrated in 1816, the church also says the bell in its steeple, weighing almost 1,000 pounds, was cast in 1822 by Paul Revere's son Joseph. New York City: Protesters force closure of Manhattan Bridge; street fires, looting A crucial bridge into Manhattan was closed Sunday to make way for protesters, a day after hundreds of arrests including the mayor's daughter, it was reported. Street fires were being set and sporadic looting was reported Sunday evening after a day that saw large groups of protesters walk from Brooklyn to Manhattan over the Manhattan Bridge, which had to be closed, ABC7 in New York reported. Mayor Bill de Blasio's daughter Chiara, 25, was among 345 arrested, the station reported based on unnamed NYPD sources. The Daily Mail said it was able to confirm the arrest from a police report. She was reportedly arrested as part of a group of 100 demonstrators who refused to leave a roadway when ordered by police. Seattle: National Guard called to Bellevue; protesters block Interstate 5 National Guard troops were ordered to the Seattle suburb of Bellevue after reports of widespread looting. Washington Gov. Jay Inslee ordered 200 National Guard members to Bellevue after the mayor declared an emergency due to violence. Rioters broke into the Bellevue Mall and were stealing goods from stores. The thefts were part of a day of protests in the Seattle area that included shutting down Interstate 5, the same freeway that San Diego demonstrators blocked more than 1,000 miles away in southern California. Chicago: Gov. JB Pritzker activates National Guardsmen to assist police Vandalism reports continued to crop up in several city neighborhoods and some suburbs. The communities of Tinley Park, Crestwood and Oak Lawn alerted residents to stay home due to civil unrest. Many businesses boarded up. Gov. J.B. Pritzker said he activated 375 Illinois National Guard soldiers to assist local law enforcement with street closures. The downtown Chicago demonstrations that drew thousands started peacefully Saturday afternoon in a plaza, with protesters reading the names of black people who have died at the hands of police. But that gave way to violence and destruction that continued overnight Sunday in Chicago and elsewhere. Police used batons to beat back demonstrators as police cars were set ablaze and windows were smashed at businesses ranging from neighborhood convenience stores to high-end Michigan Avenue shops. Santa Monica, California: Unchecked looting as marchers confront police Looters took advantage of a large demonstration several blocks away to hit stores in the city's business district. In late afternoon, police were met with resistance when they tried to end a demonstration that had been peaceful. Demonstrators constructed a makeshift barricade in the middle of a street to protect themselves from non-lethal rounds fired by officers. The march had attracted hundreds along the city's main oceanfront boulevard. Though there were many police officers present for the march, looters were able to plunder stores with few to stop them. Cars were seen pulling up in front of stores, with looters running in to collect bundles of clothes and other merchandise, then running out. Boxes littered the sidewalk as thieves were seen transferring goods into plastic trash bags. A 5:30 p.m. PST curfew was announced due to the protests. The looting came despite the arrival of the National Guard troops in neighboring Los Angeles, which had seen extensive looting, vandalism and arson on Saturday. Murfreesboro, Tennessee: Brick thrown into business, police use tear gas A small but tense demonstration in Murfreesboro, Tennessee, appeared to have dispersed after demonstrators blocked traffic and threw a brick through the window of a local business, prompting police to respond with canisters of tear gas. About 50 protesters, many of whom appeared to be Middle Tennessee State University students, marched from Main Street toward Forrest Hall, a campus building named for Confederate general and Ku Klux Klan founder Nathan Bedford Forrest. Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee said protests in Murfreesboro are now “overt threats to public safety and property.” Police said an armored vehicle was vandalized and protesters have blocked traffic by lying in the street in an intersection. Officers responded by throwing canisters of tear gas to drive protesters out of the street. However, before the protest escalated, negotiations between police and protest leaders led to calm, then students and officers were seen walking together and posing for photos. – Nancy DeGennaro, Joseph Spears, Mealand Ragland-Hudgins and Brinley Hineman, Murfreesboro Daily News Journal Savannah, Georgia: Protesters chant 'Arrest the other three' during rally Thousands demonstrated against racism and the killings of black people at the hands of police Sunday in Savannah, Georgia. City leaders joined protesters who peacefully marched from Johnson Square to City Hall. “We need to make sure that we stop apologizing and we move from apology to action,” Savannah Police Chief Roy Minter said. At one point during Mayor Van Johnson’s speech, the crowd broke into a chant of “arrest the other three,” referring to other Minneapolis police officers who stood by while an officer knelt on Floyd’s neck. “Yeah, they should arrest the other three,” Johnson said. “We are tired of the mess and we want it to stop now. We stand here as a united community to say that we are standing with George Floyd and his family, because no man should ever have to die like that,” Johnson said. “We stand here united as a community to say that crooked police officers are called criminals. And in jail, they should be.” – Will Peebles, Dennis Knight, Mary Landers, Nathan Dominitz and Zach Dennis, Savannah Morning News San Diego: Police fire tear gas after being assaulted by rocks and bottles San Diego Police said they fired tear gas canisters Sunday after rocks and bottles were thrown at them. The department said in a series of tweets that the confrontation was taking place at Second Avenue and Broadway in the seaside city's downtown. ""Certain protestors continue to throw objects and vandalize our city,"" the department said in one post. ""The criminal behavior of these few is unacceptable. We are continuing to order the crowd to disperse."" Earlier, however, the department praised the peacefulness of most demonstrators. But it said it had to issue the order to disperse because of the dangerous actions of a few. At one point, demonstrators occupied Interstate 5, stopping traffic in both directions, the San Diego Union-Tribune reported. Philadelphia: Mayor Jim Kenney 'saddened and disappointed' beyond words Another day of street protests gave way to looting, with at least one police vehicle set on fire. Looters were running out of stores in the northeastern section of the city with armloads of merchandise. In the downtown, workers and volunteers swept up broken glass from windows shattered during riots the previous day. Graffiti was being removed. Mayor Jim Kenney said the mayhem “saddened and disappointed me beyond words, and I’m sure it saddened every Philadelphian who takes pride in their city.” He said those responsible “not only desecrated private businesses, they also desecrated the important message that was heard in the earlier peaceful protests.” Spartanburg, South Carolina: Passing motorists show support for protesters Chanting “No justice, no peace,” about 100 peaceful Spartanburg, South Carolina, protesters gathered at Barnet Park, drawing support from motorists who honked their car horns. “We want to take a peaceful stand to show support,” said organizer Kelvin Brown. “If we can all come together as a people, black and white, we can make a difference.” Many protesters said it wasn’t just Floyd’s death at the hand of a white police officer, or that it took days before the officer was arrested, that triggered anger. “We need to end the racist system,” said Curtis Pickens. “If you want all this to stop, real justice is what is needed. Stop the racial and social profiling. Stop hiring white supremacist officers.” “It’s time to stand up for what we believe in,” Isaiah Jordan said. “What happened to George Floyd terrorizes the whole nation. We’ve got to do something about it. I’m just sick and tired of young, black men dying."" --Bob Montgomery, GoUpstate.com Lafayette, Louisiana: Protesters want police to know 'we're human' Hundreds of protesters, some wearing protective face coverings, lined Lafayette streets to join a peaceful demonstration against police brutality. The protest, peaceful like others in Baton Rouge and New Orleans this weekend, began in the morning with protesters lining the streets to chant. “I am sick and tired of being sick and tired,” Lafayette NAACP President Marja Broussard said to protesters. “I have a message for law enforcement. The message is: we want you to know that we’re human just like you...We want you to know we have families. We’re human.” – William Taylor Potter, Lafayette Daily Advertiser Augusta, Georgia: Demonstrators chant 'No justice, no peace' Demonstrators chanted “no justice, no peace” as they walked along Washington Road in Augusta, Georgia. While “No justice, no peace,” was a popular chant among protesters, Sunday’s peaceful march was about showing strength through peace rather than through violence, organizers said. Latoya Lovett said she asked the Street Justice Council to help her organize the marches after hearing many Augusta residents talk about going to Atlanta to join protests there, which have turned violent after peaceful starts. “You can march in your own city, you can have a voice in your own city,” Lovett said. “You don’t have to go smash windows, you don’t have to go beat people, you don’t have to drop on the police.” Demonstrators were escorted by Richmond County Sheriff’s Office deputies who blocked off roads and intersections as needed. Sheriff Richard Roundtree was among those who helped guide the marchers and ensure safety for both them and the motorists. “We believe in free speech and protesting and voicing your opinion, as long as you do it in a safe manner,” Roundtree said. “As long as you’re doing that, we’re all for it.” – Will Cheney and Miguel Legoas, The Augusta Chronicle Jacksonville, Florida: Peaceful rally follows violent Saturday night of protests A peaceful demonstration was held Sunday outside the Duval County Courthouse. Then protesters started moving downtown and Jacksonville, Florida, police worked to keep them in certain areas. The cleanup of smashed store windows began Sunday around Florida after a night of unrest throughout the state’s cities. Jacksonville Sheriff Mike Williams said an unnamed deputy was either stabbed or slashed in the neck and was taken to a hospital for treatment Saturday night. A sheriff’s office spokeswoman would not comment on the deputy’s condition Sunday morning. A protest Saturday resulted in many arrests, “but we still don’t know how many or anything related to those arrests,” the sheriff said. – Sarasota News-Tribune Cincinnati: Police make 100 arrests after urging protesters to go home Police arrested as many as 100 people after using tear gas and imploring the crowd to go home ahead of a curfew.

Mayor Jim Kenney said the mayhem “saddened and disappointed me beyond words, and I’m sure it saddened every Philadelphian who takes pride in their city.” He said those responsible “not only desecrated private businesses, they also desecrated the important message that was heard in the earlier peaceful protests.” Spartanburg, South Carolina: Passing motorists show support for protesters Chanting “No justice, no peace,” about 100 peaceful Spartanburg, South Carolina, protesters gathered at Barnet Park, drawing support from motorists who honked their car horns. “We want to take a peaceful stand to show support,” said organizer Kelvin Brown. “If we can all come together as a people, black and white, we can make a difference.” Many protesters said it wasn’t just Floyd’s death at the hand of a white police officer, or that it took days before the officer was arrested, that triggered anger. “We need to end the racist system,” said Curtis Pickens. “If you want all this to stop, real justice is what is needed. Stop the racial and social profiling. Stop hiring white supremacist officers.” “It’s time to stand up for what we believe in,” Isaiah Jordan said. “What happened to George Floyd terrorizes the whole nation. We’ve got to do something about it. I’m just sick and tired of young, black men dying."" --Bob Montgomery, GoUpstate.com Lafayette, Louisiana: Protesters want police to know 'we're human' Hundreds of protesters, some wearing protective face coverings, lined Lafayette streets to join a peaceful demonstration against police brutality. The protest, peaceful like others in Baton Rouge and New Orleans this weekend, began in the morning with protesters lining the streets to chant. “I am sick and tired of being sick and tired,” Lafayette NAACP President Marja Broussard said to protesters. “I have a message for law enforcement. The message is: we want you to know that we’re human just like you...We want you to know we have families. We’re human.” – William Taylor Potter, Lafayette Daily Advertiser Augusta, Georgia: Demonstrators chant 'No justice, no peace' Demonstrators chanted “no justice, no peace” as they walked along Washington Road in Augusta, Georgia. While “No justice, no peace,” was a popular chant among protesters, Sunday’s peaceful march was about showing strength through peace rather than through violence, organizers said. Latoya Lovett said she asked the Street Justice Council to help her organize the marches after hearing many Augusta residents talk about going to Atlanta to join protests there, which have turned violent after peaceful starts. “You can march in your own city, you can have a voice in your own city,” Lovett said. “You don’t have to go smash windows, you don’t have to go beat people, you don’t have to drop on the police.” Demonstrators were escorted by Richmond County Sheriff’s Office deputies who blocked off roads and intersections as needed. Sheriff Richard Roundtree was among those who helped guide the marchers and ensure safety for both them and the motorists. “We believe in free speech and protesting and voicing your opinion, as long as you do it in a safe manner,” Roundtree said. “As long as you’re doing that, we’re all for it.” – Will Cheney and Miguel Legoas, The Augusta Chronicle Jacksonville, Florida: Peaceful rally follows violent Saturday night of protests A peaceful demonstration was held Sunday outside the Duval County Courthouse. Then protesters started moving downtown and Jacksonville, Florida, police worked to keep them in certain areas. The cleanup of smashed store windows began Sunday around Florida after a night of unrest throughout the state’s cities. Jacksonville Sheriff Mike Williams said an unnamed deputy was either stabbed or slashed in the neck and was taken to a hospital for treatment Saturday night. A sheriff’s office spokeswoman would not comment on the deputy’s condition Sunday morning. A protest Saturday resulted in many arrests, “but we still don’t know how many or anything related to those arrests,” the sheriff said. – Sarasota News-Tribune Cincinnati: Police make 100 arrests after urging protesters to go home Police arrested as many as 100 people after using tear gas and imploring the crowd to go home ahead of a curfew. It ended a day that earlier featured a large crowd gathered at Inwood Park in Cincinnati to hear speakers as a rally, followed by a march. Organizers gave instructions about what to do if they are tear-gassed. The rally started with a fist-up salute and a song about the death Sam DuBose, shot by a police officer not far from the scene of this protest in 2015.

Most demonstrations, some attracting hundreds of people, were peaceful though violence, including the burning of police vehicles and looting, prompted police in some cities to deploy tear gas to gain control of the crowd. Early in the day, volunteers turned out in many cities to sweep up debris from businesses that had been burned, had their windows broken or were otherwise damaged Saturday. Here's a look at how protests are unfolding around the country on Sunday: Washington, D.C.: Historic St. John's Church near White House set ablaze As protesters gathered near the White House, flames were seen at the Washington, D.C., landmark that bills itself as ""the church of the presidents."" The fire, apparently an act of arson, was in the basement of St. John's Church, across from the White House, The Washington Post reported, and was extinguished. It occurred as a demonstration was taking place outside. The gathering had attracted as many as 1,000 Sunday, who faced off against officers in riot gear. The Episcopalian church in Lafayette Square boasts on its website that every U.S. president since James Madison has attended services there. Consecrated in 1816, the church also says the bell in its steeple, weighing almost 1,000 pounds, was cast in 1822 by Paul Revere's son Joseph. New York City: Protesters force closure of Manhattan Bridge; street fires, looting A crucial bridge into Manhattan was closed Sunday to make way for protesters, a day after hundreds of arrests including the mayor's daughter, it was reported. Street fires were being set and sporadic looting was reported Sunday evening after a day that saw large groups of protesters walk from Brooklyn to Manhattan over the Manhattan Bridge, which had to be closed, ABC7 in New York reported. Mayor Bill de Blasio's daughter Chiara, 25, was among 345 arrested, the station reported based on unnamed NYPD sources. The Daily Mail said it was able to confirm the arrest from a police report. She was reportedly arrested as part of a group of 100 demonstrators who refused to leave a roadway when ordered by police. Seattle: National Guard called to Bellevue; protesters block Interstate 5 National Guard troops were ordered to the Seattle suburb of Bellevue after reports of widespread looting. Washington Gov. Jay Inslee ordered 200 National Guard members to Bellevue after the mayor declared an emergency due to violence. Rioters broke into the Bellevue Mall and were stealing goods from stores. The thefts were part of a day of protests in the Seattle area that included shutting down Interstate 5, the same freeway that San Diego demonstrators blocked more than 1,000 miles away in southern California. Chicago: Gov. JB Pritzker activates National Guardsmen to assist police Vandalism reports continued to crop up in several city neighborhoods and some suburbs. The communities of Tinley Park, Crestwood and Oak Lawn alerted residents to stay home due to civil unrest. Many businesses boarded up. Gov. J.B. Pritzker said he activated 375 Illinois National Guard soldiers to assist local law enforcement with street closures. The downtown Chicago demonstrations that drew thousands started peacefully Saturday afternoon in a plaza, with protesters reading the names of black people who have died at the hands of police. But that gave way to violence and destruction that continued overnight Sunday in Chicago and elsewhere. Police used batons to beat back demonstrators as police cars were set ablaze and windows were smashed at businesses ranging from neighborhood convenience stores to high-end Michigan Avenue shops. Santa Monica, California: Unchecked looting as marchers confront police Looters took advantage of a large demonstration several blocks away to hit stores in the city's business district. In late afternoon, police were met with resistance when they tried to end a demonstration that had been peaceful. Demonstrators constructed a makeshift barricade in the middle of a street to protect themselves from non-lethal rounds fired by officers. The march had attracted hundreds along the city's main oceanfront boulevard. Though there were many police officers present for the march, looters were able to plunder stores with few to stop them. Cars were seen pulling up in front of stores, with looters running in to collect bundles of clothes and other merchandise, then running out. Boxes littered the sidewalk as thieves were seen transferring goods into plastic trash bags. A 5:30 p.m. PST curfew was announced due to the protests. The looting came despite the arrival of the National Guard troops in neighboring Los Angeles, which had seen extensive looting, vandalism and arson on Saturday. Murfreesboro, Tennessee: Brick thrown into business, police use tear gas A small but tense demonstration in Murfreesboro, Tennessee, appeared to have dispersed after demonstrators blocked traffic and threw a brick through the window of a local business, prompting police to respond with canisters of tear gas. About 50 protesters, many of whom appeared to be Middle Tennessee State University students, marched from Main Street toward Forrest Hall, a campus building named for Confederate general and Ku Klux Klan founder Nathan Bedford Forrest. Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee said protests in Murfreesboro are now “overt threats to public safety and property.” Police said an armored vehicle was vandalized and protesters have blocked traffic by lying in the street in an intersection. Officers responded by throwing canisters of tear gas to drive protesters out of the street. However, before the protest escalated, negotiations between police and protest leaders led to calm, then students and officers were seen walking together and posing for photos. – Nancy DeGennaro, Joseph Spears, Mealand Ragland-Hudgins and Brinley Hineman, Murfreesboro Daily News Journal Savannah, Georgia: Protesters chant 'Arrest the other three' during rally Thousands demonstrated against racism and the killings of black people at the hands of police Sunday in Savannah, Georgia. City leaders joined protesters who peacefully marched from Johnson Square to City Hall. “We need to make sure that we stop apologizing and we move from apology to action,” Savannah Police Chief Roy Minter said. At one point during Mayor Van Johnson’s speech, the crowd broke into a chant of “arrest the other three,” referring to other Minneapolis police officers who stood by while an officer knelt on Floyd’s neck. “Yeah, they should arrest the other three,” Johnson said. “We are tired of the mess and we want it to stop now. We stand here as a united community to say that we are standing with George Floyd and his family, because no man should ever have to die like that,” Johnson said. “We stand here united as a community to say that crooked police officers are called criminals. And in jail, they should be.” – Will Peebles, Dennis Knight, Mary Landers, Nathan Dominitz and Zach Dennis, Savannah Morning News San Diego: Police fire tear gas after being assaulted by rocks and bottles San Diego Police said they fired tear gas canisters Sunday after rocks and bottles were thrown at them. The department said in a series of tweets that the confrontation was taking place at Second Avenue and Broadway in the seaside city's downtown. ""Certain protestors continue to throw objects and vandalize our city,"" the department said in one post. ""The criminal behavior of these few is unacceptable. We are continuing to order the crowd to disperse."" Earlier, however, the department praised the peacefulness of most demonstrators. But it said it had to issue the order to disperse because of the dangerous actions of a few. At one point, demonstrators occupied Interstate 5, stopping traffic in both directions, the San Diego Union-Tribune reported. Philadelphia: Mayor Jim Kenney 'saddened and disappointed' beyond words Another day of street protests gave way to looting, with at least one police vehicle set on fire. Looters were running out of stores in the northeastern section of the city with armloads of merchandise. In the downtown, workers and volunteers swept up broken glass from windows shattered during riots the previous day. Graffiti was being removed. Mayor Jim Kenney said the mayhem “saddened and disappointed me beyond words, and I’m sure it saddened every Philadelphian who takes pride in their city.” He said those responsible “not only desecrated private businesses, they also desecrated the important message that was heard in the earlier peaceful protests.” Spartanburg, South Carolina: Passing motorists show support for protesters Chanting “No justice, no peace,” about 100 peaceful Spartanburg, South Carolina, protesters gathered at Barnet Park, drawing support from motorists who honked their car horns. “We want to take a peaceful stand to show support,” said organizer Kelvin Brown. “If we can all come together as a people, black and white, we can make a difference.” Many protesters said it wasn’t just Floyd’s death at the hand of a white police officer, or that it took days before the officer was arrested, that triggered anger. “We need to end the racist system,” said Curtis Pickens. “If you want all this to stop, real justice is what is needed.

What do we tell our children?,https://www.fosters.com/zz/news/20200601/george-floyd-ahmaud-arbery-breonna-taylor-what-do-we-tell-our-children?rssfeed=true,en,False,,82445,fosters.com,http://www.fosters.com/#spider,"Should we tell the children? How? Those are among the many questions parents are asking after the recent deaths of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor. Many white parents wonder whether to talk with their kids at all, while parents of color swallow their grief and fear to have ""the talk"" once again. These deaths are part of a more complex story, one some parents have been telling for generations, and others have long felt they've had the luxury to ignore. But experts in child psychology and race-based stress say these conversations are essential for all parents to have, and they underscore that there are developmentally appropriate ways to talk to children of all ages about racism and police brutality. ""Silence will not protect you or them,"" said Beverly Daniel Tatum, a psychologist and author of, Why Are All The Black Kids Sitting Together in the Cafeteria? And Other Conversations About Race. ""Avoiding the topic is not a solution."" Racism persists, experts say, because many parents avoid difficult conversations. ""One of the most important things to remember is that you may not have all the answers and that is OK,"" said Erlanger Turner, a clinical psychologist and assistant professor of psychology at Pepperdine University who studies mental health among racial communities. USA TODAY spoke with Tatum and Turner about how to talk with children about racial violence: Why is it important to talk with children about what happened to George Floyd and other incidents of police brutality or racism in the news? Beverly Daniel Tatum: Even young children may see or hear about highly publicized incidents like the George Floyd case – perhaps overhearing the TV or the radio – and may ask questions. Or if parents are upset by the news, the child may perceive the parent’s distress and ask why mom or dad is upset. In either case, an age-appropriate explanation is better than silence. Older children with Internet access may see online images on their own. Initiating an age-appropriate conversation can give children a helpful frame for understanding difficult realities. If parents are silent, children will draw their own often faulty conclusions about what is happening and why. Erlanger Turner: Many adults are hurt and angered by these events and their children may notice changes in their mood. It is helpful to have a healthy conversation around what happened and also talk about ways to cope when you witness social injustice. Does COVID-19 warrant avoiding these conversations, given many children are already struggling with fear, anxiety and uncertainty? BDT: No. Not talking about upsetting events only fuels fear, anxiety and uncertainty. Being able to talk about something with a supportive adult can reduce fear, anxiety and uncertainty. Parents may avoid the conversation because they don’t know what to say, but it is a mistake to think that their silence is helpful. ET: I don't think that anxiety and fear about COVID-19 should stop a parent from talking about police brutality. This issue has been increasing in concern over the last few years as the number of black and brown people killed by police continue to rise. I think if you do talk with your child don't leave them in a high state of worry. Make sure to end the conversation by engaging in a pleasant activity after the difficult discussion so they won't stay worried or afraid. How do parents start these conversations and how does that change depending on the age of their children? ET: I think the first place to start a conversation around racism and police brutality is with honesty. Take ownership of your feelings and be comfortable sharing those feelings with your child. Then you can begin to allow them to share what they may already know about racial differences. I think that it is always good to allow children to share their opinion and understanding before you offer information. For younger children conversations about racism should be limited to basic facts about how people are treated differently due to the color of their skin but also acknowledge that not everyone treats people differently based on race. For older teens, parents can consider exposure to news or social media posts as discussion points about this issue. BDT: Regardless of the age of the child, it is important to balance acknowledging the reality of racism, or unfairness, with messages about the possibility of change, and the community of allies who are working together to make things better. If a child of color asks if a police officer is going to kill them, what do you say? BDT: The answer will depend on the age of the child. If it is a young child, a parent can be reassuring. “No, honey, you don’t have to worry about that. Police officers don’t want to hurt you.” In response to an older child, it can be reassuring to say something like: ""I know that it is scary to think that something like that might happen, and I really don’t want you to worry about anything like that. I know that most police officers want to help people, and most police officers never fire their guns. But sometimes they do get nervous and make mistakes. So it is important for you to know what to do if a police officer ever stops you…” Black parents often refer to this as “the talk” they have to have with their adolescent sons to increase the odds they will survive an encounter with a police officer if and when they are stopped. ET: That is a tough question. Depending on the age of the child, they may have some awareness of youth that have been killed by police. Obviously you don't want to respond in a way that is going to make children be more fearful for their safety. In my opinion, I think that you should let children know that most police officers work to protect them and their community. If a child says they are afraid or angry, what do you say? BDT: Acknowledge the child’s feelings. The parent may have similar feelings. “I know it’s upsetting to hear about and see these things happening. It upsets me too when bad things like this happen. Racism is very unfair. But it makes me feel better to know there are lots of people who want to change things."" Being able to offer specific examples of community change agents would be useful. Being able to talk about what family members are doing to speak up against unfairness is especially useful. Actions always speak louder than words. ET: If a child tells you that they are angry, that is appropriate. Don't force them to hide their emotional expression. However, be sure to help them identify ways to express their anger in a healthy manner which may include journaling or exercising to release the energy from their body. If a child is afraid for one of their friends, what do you say? BDT: “I can see that you are worried about your friend. What do you think we could do that might help him or her?” Depending on the situation, this could be an opportunity to talk about what it means to be an ally, and how to stand in solidarity with another person. ET: If a child is afraid for one of their friends, talk with them about those emotions. Allow the child to express why they may be afraid and help them identify how they can check on their friend's safety to ease their anxiety or fear. Part of what increases anxiety is the fear of the unknown. If you have a plan of action it will reduce some of those fears. How can parents talk about law enforcement in a way that is honest but also doesn’t discourage children from seeking help from law enforcement when appropriate? BDT: Most police officers become police officers because they want to help people. And there are times when we would really want a police officer to help us – give some examples – if there’s been a car accident, or if someone took something that belonged to us, etc. But sometimes a police officer does something bad, like today. When that happens, we might start to think that all police officers are like that. But it’s important to remember that that is not true. ET: I think that it is very important to talk with the children about law enforcement. For example, you can talk with them about how they protect rules in society such as making sure that people don't drive too fast so they won't harm themselves or others. Providing clear examples about the ways that law enforcement helps society will allow the child to better understand. You can also be honest about situations such as police brutality and let children know that some police officers break laws. If you have a trusted officer in your community it may be good to also allow the child to talk with them in person to reduce their fear. Should these conversations be different depending on the race of the child? BDT: Children of color are likely to experience racist encounters as they get older. They need to be helped to understand their own worth and feel affirmed in their identity as young people of color despite the negative messages they may get from others. Parents of color want to raise self-confident and empowered children who are not demoralized by other people’s racism. This requires lots of conversation about racism and how to resist it in an ongoing way throughout their children’s lives. White children are often racially isolated as a consequence of segregated schools and neighborhoods, and consequently limited in their understanding of people different from themselves. White parents who want to interrupt the cycle of racism must learn to talk to their children about it and model their own anti-racist activity. ET: According to research, white parents often don't talk with their children about race or may emphasize ""not seeing color."" The concept of colorblindness or ""not seeing color"" is more harmful than helpful and does not honor an individual's identity. ... For white families, research suggests ... conversations should focus on raising anti-racist children and encouraging more friendships with children from others races. Many of these deaths garner attention because footage of it goes viral. What should we say if our child asks to see it? BDT: There are many adults who don’t want to see such footage. I would not show it to a child at all. Once an image is in your head, it is very difficult to get it out. That said, it is reasonable to describe what happened and talk about why it was wrong. It is also likely that children with Internet access can view the footage without an adult’s permission or assistance. Talking about it after the fact will help children process their feelings. ET: You should not show your children these videos as it may increase the likelihood of them experiencing symptoms of trauma or having nightmares. What we know from research on witnessing disasters is that individuals may be at a higher risk of developing post-traumatic stress disorder even through indirect exposure to these events. What do we say if, in the course of this conversation, a child says something racist? BDT: Inquire about it with curiosity, not judgment. ""I’m wondering why you said that…"" After hearing more about what the child is thinking, you can offer correction by providing new information. “You know, a lot of people might think that is true, but I don’t because….” ET: I think the first thing to do is to not get defensive. You want to foster open communication with your child. However, I think you should explore why they have that opinion, where did they learn it from, and tell them why what they said was wrong. It might be helpful for you as a parent to think about ways that you may have unconsciously expressed racist attitudes. How can parents explain the uprisings in a way that doesn’t condone violence but also doesn't minimize the sense of injustice fueling them? BDT: Children understand the concept of unfairness as well as the experience of frustration. Years and years of unfairness – racism – results in intense anger and frustration. The conversation can then be about what we must do to fix the continuing unfairness. ET: I think it is important for parents to be honest. Share your hurt, anger, or disappointment with your child. You should also talk about different ways to protest social injustice such as calling your local politicians office or even visit their office to talk with them about policy change to reduce injustice.

1622482544,2020-06-01 12:32:51,Minneapolis is trying to recover after days of George Floyd protests – one bag of garbage and one food donation at a time,https://www.fosters.com/zz/news/20200601/minneapolis-is-trying-to-recover-after-days-of-george-floyd-protests---one-bag-of-garbage-and-one-food-donation-at-time?rssfeed=true,en,False,,82445,fosters.com,http://www.fosters.com/#spider,"MINNEAPOLIS — At the end of a week that roiled this city of 400,000, there were people carrying brooms and garbage bags on a sunny Sunday. Jack Manderscheid, a University of Minnesota senior, exemplified the spirit of the day by meticulously walking through the Uptown neighborhood filling up four trash bags that he carried on his bicycle. “I’ve never really seen a community come together,” said Manderscheid, a native of suburban Edina who woke up Sunday intent on finding one gesture to help put the city. There have been five nights of anguished protests following the Monday death of George Floyd, a black man whose neck was knelt on for nearly nine minutes by Derek Chauvin, a white police officer. Manderscheid had attended a demonstration earlier in the week, but the fumes from tear gas used by police officers bothered him. So had the large crowds during a time when he is trying to keep his distance from people over fears of spreading the new coronavirus. He instead decided to clean the streets and sidewalks, only to find that hundreds of others had the same idea. “The longer this goes on, the more I realize I’m going to remember this the rest of my life,” Manderscheid said. Meanwhile, Dan Halvorsen picked up trash and swept away debris along with seven other members of his church in suburban Bloomington. “We wanted to perform a good deed. Our hearts are just breaking about this whole situation,” he said. “By the time we got here, the response has been so amazing, that there wasn’t a big need for us.” Other residents found a way to help by providing food, diapers and other essentials in a city where most stores and restaurants are closed. That’s how Tracy Gray Knutson found herself an unwitting, but perfectly willing, Santa Claus of sorts. Knutson, 40, sat down on a chair on the sidewalk outside a boarded-up Franklin Avenue café, planning to rest her sunburned feet. Above her, a large sign read: “Free Food and Stuff.” Residents of the south Minneapolis neighborhood surveyed the scene and decided that Knutson was in charge of a popup pantry. Soon, they descended on her with sacks of bread, beans and other groceries, plus diapers, bottled water and even more garbage bags ready to be filled. Knutson, who said she is recently homeless, enjoyed giving the goods away to a line of people who politely approached her, asking if it was really free. “Anything you want, brother. Take anything,” she implored one hesitant man. “I love you.” A few blocks away on Franklin Avenue, an east-west thoroughfare lined with stores that now sit empty, Alan Gross oversaw an impromptu food shelf that quickly resembled a warehouse. Gross, 52, jokingly called himself a barista/counselor/bouncer at two businesses that share a building: Powwow Grounds Coffee and All My Relations Gallery. The latter is a large space that typically displays American Indian art. It was shuttered in March after the COVID-19 threat forced the closure of museums and galleries in Minnesota. The art has been relocated, although Gross hopes to reopen soon. On Sunday, the floor was rapidly filling with food brought in by the carload from people eager to help. It all happened over the course of 72 hours, after word went out on Facebook that the gallery would serve as a distribution point for groceries in the neighborhood. Gross was surprised by the amount of donated food but philosophical about the motivation of his fellow Minnesotans. “Pitching in, believing that there’s a better way to do things, I think that’s the draw,” he said. “Everyone’s got to have a cause.”",0.0

How? Those are among the many questions parents are asking after the recent deaths of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor. Many white parents wonder whether to talk with their kids at all, while parents of color swallow their grief and fear to have ""the talk"" once again. These deaths are part of a more complex story, one some parents have been telling for generations, and others have long felt they've had the luxury to ignore. But experts in child psychology and race-based stress say these conversations are essential for all parents to have, and they underscore that there are developmentally appropriate ways to talk to children of all ages about racism and police brutality. ""Silence will not protect you or them,"" said Beverly Daniel Tatum, a psychologist and author of, Why Are All The Black Kids Sitting Together in the Cafeteria? And Other Conversations About Race. ""Avoiding the topic is not a solution."" Racism persists, experts say, because many parents avoid difficult conversations. ""One of the most important things to remember is that you may not have all the answers and that is OK,"" said Erlanger Turner, a clinical psychologist and assistant professor of psychology at Pepperdine University who studies mental health among racial communities. USA TODAY spoke with Tatum and Turner about how to talk with children about racial violence: Why is it important to talk with children about what happened to George Floyd and other incidents of police brutality or racism in the news? Beverly Daniel Tatum: Even young children may see or hear about highly publicized incidents like the George Floyd case – perhaps overhearing the TV or the radio – and may ask questions. Or if parents are upset by the news, the child may perceive the parent’s distress and ask why mom or dad is upset. In either case, an age-appropriate explanation is better than silence. Older children with Internet access may see online images on their own. Initiating an age-appropriate conversation can give children a helpful frame for understanding difficult realities. If parents are silent, children will draw their own often faulty conclusions about what is happening and why. Erlanger Turner: Many adults are hurt and angered by these events and their children may notice changes in their mood. It is helpful to have a healthy conversation around what happened and also talk about ways to cope when you witness social injustice. Does COVID-19 warrant avoiding these conversations, given many children are already struggling with fear, anxiety and uncertainty? BDT: No. Not talking about upsetting events only fuels fear, anxiety and uncertainty. Being able to talk about something with a supportive adult can reduce fear, anxiety and uncertainty. Parents may avoid the conversation because they don’t know what to say, but it is a mistake to think that their silence is helpful. ET: I don't think that anxiety and fear about COVID-19 should stop a parent from talking about police brutality. This issue has been increasing in concern over the last few years as the number of black and brown people killed by police continue to rise. I think if you do talk with your child don't leave them in a high state of worry. Make sure to end the conversation by engaging in a pleasant activity after the difficult discussion so they won't stay worried or afraid. How do parents start these conversations and how does that change depending on the age of their children? ET: I think the first place to start a conversation around racism and police brutality is with honesty. Take ownership of your feelings and be comfortable sharing those feelings with your child. Then you can begin to allow them to share what they may already know about racial differences. I think that it is always good to allow children to share their opinion and understanding before you offer information. For younger children conversations about racism should be limited to basic facts about how people are treated differently due to the color of their skin but also acknowledge that not everyone treats people differently based on race. For older teens, parents can consider exposure to news or social media posts as discussion points about this issue. BDT: Regardless of the age of the child, it is important to balance acknowledging the reality of racism, or unfairness, with messages about the possibility of change, and the community of allies who are working together to make things better. If a child of color asks if a police officer is going to kill them, what do you say? BDT: The answer will depend on the age of the child. If it is a young child, a parent can be reassuring. “No, honey, you don’t have to worry about that. Police officers don’t want to hurt you.” In response to an older child, it can be reassuring to say something like: ""I know that it is scary to think that something like that might happen, and I really don’t want you to worry about anything like that. I know that most police officers want to help people, and most police officers never fire their guns. But sometimes they do get nervous and make mistakes. So it is important for you to know what to do if a police officer ever stops you…” Black parents often refer to this as “the talk” they have to have with their adolescent sons to increase the odds they will survive an encounter with a police officer if and when they are stopped. ET: That is a tough question. Depending on the age of the child, they may have some awareness of youth that have been killed by police. Obviously you don't want to respond in a way that is going to make children be more fearful for their safety. In my opinion, I think that you should let children know that most police officers work to protect them and their community. If a child says they are afraid or angry, what do you say? BDT: Acknowledge the child’s feelings. The parent may have similar feelings. “I know it’s upsetting to hear about and see these things happening. It upsets me too when bad things like this happen.

What do we tell our children?,https://www.seacoastonline.com/zz/news/20200601/george-floyd-ahmaud-arbery-breonna-taylor-what-do-we-tell-our-children?rssfeed=true,en,False,,662008,Exeter News Letter,http://www.seacoastonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/section?Category=NEWS11,"Should we tell the children? How? Those are among the many questions parents are asking after the recent deaths of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor. Many white parents wonder whether to talk with their kids at all, while parents of color swallow their grief and fear to have ""the talk"" once again. These deaths are part of a more complex story, one some parents have been telling for generations, and others have long felt they've had the luxury to ignore. But experts in child psychology and race-based stress say these conversations are essential for all parents to have, and they underscore that there are developmentally appropriate ways to talk to children of all ages about racism and police brutality. ""Silence will not protect you or them,"" said Beverly Daniel Tatum, a psychologist and author of, Why Are All The Black Kids Sitting Together in the Cafeteria? And Other Conversations About Race. ""Avoiding the topic is not a solution."" Racism persists, experts say, because many parents avoid difficult conversations. ""One of the most important things to remember is that you may not have all the answers and that is OK,"" said Erlanger Turner, a clinical psychologist and assistant professor of psychology at Pepperdine University who studies mental health among racial communities. USA TODAY spoke with Tatum and Turner about how to talk with children about racial violence: Why is it important to talk with children about what happened to George Floyd and other incidents of police brutality or racism in the news? Beverly Daniel Tatum: Even young children may see or hear about highly publicized incidents like the George Floyd case – perhaps overhearing the TV or the radio – and may ask questions. Or if parents are upset by the news, the child may perceive the parent’s distress and ask why mom or dad is upset. In either case, an age-appropriate explanation is better than silence. Older children with Internet access may see online images on their own. Initiating an age-appropriate conversation can give children a helpful frame for understanding difficult realities. If parents are silent, children will draw their own often faulty conclusions about what is happening and why. Erlanger Turner: Many adults are hurt and angered by these events and their children may notice changes in their mood. It is helpful to have a healthy conversation around what happened and also talk about ways to cope when you witness social injustice. Does COVID-19 warrant avoiding these conversations, given many children are already struggling with fear, anxiety and uncertainty? BDT: No. Not talking about upsetting events only fuels fear, anxiety and uncertainty. Being able to talk about something with a supportive adult can reduce fear, anxiety and uncertainty. Parents may avoid the conversation because they don’t know what to say, but it is a mistake to think that their silence is helpful. ET: I don't think that anxiety and fear about COVID-19 should stop a parent from talking about police brutality. This issue has been increasing in concern over the last few years as the number of black and brown people killed by police continue to rise. I think if you do talk with your child don't leave them in a high state of worry. Make sure to end the conversation by engaging in a pleasant activity after the difficult discussion so they won't stay worried or afraid. How do parents start these conversations and how does that change depending on the age of their children? ET: I think the first place to start a conversation around racism and police brutality is with honesty. Take ownership of your feelings and be comfortable sharing those feelings with your child. Then you can begin to allow them to share what they may already know about racial differences. I think that it is always good to allow children to share their opinion and understanding before you offer information. For younger children conversations about racism should be limited to basic facts about how people are treated differently due to the color of their skin but also acknowledge that not everyone treats people differently based on race. For older teens, parents can consider exposure to news or social media posts as discussion points about this issue. BDT: Regardless of the age of the child, it is important to balance acknowledging the reality of racism, or unfairness, with messages about the possibility of change, and the community of allies who are working together to make things better. If a child of color asks if a police officer is going to kill them, what do you say? BDT: The answer will depend on the age of the child. If it is a young child, a parent can be reassuring. “No, honey, you don’t have to worry about that. Police officers don’t want to hurt you.” In response to an older child, it can be reassuring to say something like: ""I know that it is scary to think that something like that might happen, and I really don’t want you to worry about anything like that. I know that most police officers want to help people, and most police officers never fire their guns. But sometimes they do get nervous and make mistakes. So it is important for you to know what to do if a police officer ever stops you…” Black parents often refer to this as “the talk” they have to have with their adolescent sons to increase the odds they will survive an encounter with a police officer if and when they are stopped. ET: That is a tough question. Depending on the age of the child, they may have some awareness of youth that have been killed by police. Obviously you don't want to respond in a way that is going to make children be more fearful for their safety. In my opinion, I think that you should let children know that most police officers work to protect them and their community. If a child says they are afraid or angry, what do you say? BDT: Acknowledge the child’s feelings. The parent may have similar feelings. “I know it’s upsetting to hear about and see these things happening. It upsets me too when bad things like this happen. Racism is very unfair. But it makes me feel better to know there are lots of people who want to change things."" Being able to offer specific examples of community change agents would be useful. Being able to talk about what family members are doing to speak up against unfairness is especially useful. Actions always speak louder than words. ET: If a child tells you that they are angry, that is appropriate. Don't force them to hide their emotional expression. However, be sure to help them identify ways to express their anger in a healthy manner which may include journaling or exercising to release the energy from their body. If a child is afraid for one of their friends, what do you say? BDT: “I can see that you are worried about your friend. What do you think we could do that might help him or her?” Depending on the situation, this could be an opportunity to talk about what it means to be an ally, and how to stand in solidarity with another person. ET: If a child is afraid for one of their friends, talk with them about those emotions. Allow the child to express why they may be afraid and help them identify how they can check on their friend's safety to ease their anxiety or fear. Part of what increases anxiety is the fear of the unknown. If you have a plan of action it will reduce some of those fears. How can parents talk about law enforcement in a way that is honest but also doesn’t discourage children from seeking help from law enforcement when appropriate? BDT: Most police officers become police officers because they want to help people. And there are times when we would really want a police officer to help us – give some examples – if there’s been a car accident, or if someone took something that belonged to us, etc. But sometimes a police officer does something bad, like today. When that happens, we might start to think that all police officers are like that. But it’s important to remember that that is not true. ET: I think that it is very important to talk with the children about law enforcement. For example, you can talk with them about how they protect rules in society such as making sure that people don't drive too fast so they won't harm themselves or others. Providing clear examples about the ways that law enforcement helps society will allow the child to better understand. You can also be honest about situations such as police brutality and let children know that some police officers break laws. If you have a trusted officer in your community it may be good to also allow the child to talk with them in person to reduce their fear. Should these conversations be different depending on the race of the child? BDT: Children of color are likely to experience racist encounters as they get older. They need to be helped to understand their own worth and feel affirmed in their identity as young people of color despite the negative messages they may get from others. Parents of color want to raise self-confident and empowered children who are not demoralized by other people’s racism. This requires lots of conversation about racism and how to resist it in an ongoing way throughout their children’s lives. White children are often racially isolated as a consequence of segregated schools and neighborhoods, and consequently limited in their understanding of people different from themselves. White parents who want to interrupt the cycle of racism must learn to talk to their children about it and model their own anti-racist activity. ET: According to research, white parents often don't talk with their children about race or may emphasize ""not seeing color."" The concept of colorblindness or ""not seeing color"" is more harmful than helpful and does not honor an individual's identity. ... For white families, research suggests ... conversations should focus on raising anti-racist children and encouraging more friendships with children from others races. Many of these deaths garner attention because footage of it goes viral. What should we say if our child asks to see it? BDT: There are many adults who don’t want to see such footage. I would not show it to a child at all. Once an image is in your head, it is very difficult to get it out. That said, it is reasonable to describe what happened and talk about why it was wrong. It is also likely that children with Internet access can view the footage without an adult’s permission or assistance. Talking about it after the fact will help children process their feelings. ET: You should not show your children these videos as it may increase the likelihood of them experiencing symptoms of trauma or having nightmares. What we know from research on witnessing disasters is that individuals may be at a higher risk of developing post-traumatic stress disorder even through indirect exposure to these events. What do we say if, in the course of this conversation, a child says something racist? BDT: Inquire about it with curiosity, not judgment. ""I’m wondering why you said that…"" After hearing more about what the child is thinking, you can offer correction by providing new information. “You know, a lot of people might think that is true, but I don’t because….” ET: I think the first thing to do is to not get defensive. You want to foster open communication with your child. However, I think you should explore why they have that opinion, where did they learn it from, and tell them why what they said was wrong. It might be helpful for you as a parent to think about ways that you may have unconsciously expressed racist attitudes. How can parents explain the uprisings in a way that doesn’t condone violence but also doesn't minimize the sense of injustice fueling them? BDT: Children understand the concept of unfairness as well as the experience of frustration. Years and years of unfairness – racism – results in intense anger and frustration. The conversation can then be about what we must do to fix the continuing unfairness. ET: I think it is important for parents to be honest. Share your hurt, anger, or disappointment with your child.

Jack Manderscheid, a University of Minnesota senior, exemplified the spirit of the day by meticulously walking through the Uptown neighborhood filling up four trash bags that he carried on his bicycle. “I’ve never really seen a community come together,” said Manderscheid, a native of suburban Edina who woke up Sunday intent on finding one gesture to help put the city. There have been five nights of anguished protests following the Monday death of George Floyd, a black man whose neck was knelt on for nearly nine minutes by Derek Chauvin, a white police officer. Manderscheid had attended a demonstration earlier in the week, but the fumes from tear gas used by police officers bothered him. So had the large crowds during a time when he is trying to keep his distance from people over fears of spreading the new coronavirus. He instead decided to clean the streets and sidewalks, only to find that hundreds of others had the same idea. “The longer this goes on, the more I realize I’m going to remember this the rest of my life,” Manderscheid said. Meanwhile, Dan Halvorsen picked up trash and swept away debris along with seven other members of his church in suburban Bloomington. “We wanted to perform a good deed. Our hearts are just breaking about this whole situation,” he said. “By the time we got here, the response has been so amazing, that there wasn’t a big need for us.” Other residents found a way to help by providing food, diapers and other essentials in a city where most stores and restaurants are closed. That’s how Tracy Gray Knutson found herself an unwitting, but perfectly willing, Santa Claus of sorts. Knutson, 40, sat down on a chair on the sidewalk outside a boarded-up Franklin Avenue café, planning to rest her sunburned feet. Above her, a large sign read: “Free Food and Stuff.” Residents of the south Minneapolis neighborhood surveyed the scene and decided that Knutson was in charge of a popup pantry. Soon, they descended on her with sacks of bread, beans and other groceries, plus diapers, bottled water and even more garbage bags ready to be filled. Knutson, who said she is recently homeless, enjoyed giving the goods away to a line of people who politely approached her, asking if it was really free. “Anything you want, brother. Take anything,” she implored one hesitant man. “I love you.” A few blocks away on Franklin Avenue, an east-west thoroughfare lined with stores that now sit empty, Alan Gross oversaw an impromptu food shelf that quickly resembled a warehouse. Gross, 52, jokingly called himself a barista/counselor/bouncer at two businesses that share a building: Powwow Grounds Coffee and All My Relations Gallery. The latter is a large space that typically displays American Indian art. It was shuttered in March after the COVID-19 threat forced the closure of museums and galleries in Minnesota. The art has been relocated, although Gross hopes to reopen soon. On Sunday, the floor was rapidly filling with food brought in by the carload from people eager to help. It all happened over the course of 72 hours, after word went out on Facebook that the gallery would serve as a distribution point for groceries in the neighborhood. Gross was surprised by the amount of donated food but philosophical about the motivation of his fellow Minnesotans. “Pitching in, believing that there’s a better way to do things, I think that’s the draw,” he said. “Everyone’s got to have a cause.”",0.0

Jack Manderscheid, a University of Minnesota senior, exemplified the spirit of the day by meticulously walking through the Uptown neighborhood filling up four trash bags that he carried on his bicycle. “I’ve never really seen a community come together,” said Manderscheid, a native of suburban Edina who woke up Sunday intent on finding one gesture to help put the city. There have been five nights of anguished protests following the Monday death of George Floyd, a black man whose neck was knelt on for nearly nine minutes by Derek Chauvin, a white police officer.

Soon, they descended on her with sacks of bread, beans and other groceries, plus diapers, bottled water and even more garbage bags ready to be filled. Knutson, who said she is recently homeless, enjoyed giving the goods away to a line of people who politely approached her, asking if it was really free. “Anything you want, brother.

On Sunday night, the twins and members of the Patriots secondary held a round table discussion on their Double Coverage Podcast. For almost an hour and 15 minutes, the McCourty’s interviewed multiple people who are actively trying to bring change. They also answered questions and discussed their own personal feelings on the ongoing racial problems in this country. ""Me and Dev just thought with everything going on in the country, we’d spend some time just to talk about it,"" Jason McCourty said in the podcast. ""Sports is obviously something that plays a huge role in our loves, but right now sports doesn’t seem like something that is very important. There’s a lot of things going on in our country from the pandemic to the racial issues that have gone on and plagued our country for hundreds and hundreds of years. We just wanted to open up our platform and be able to discuss some of these things."" This isn’t out of the ordinary for the McCourty twins. The brothers have dedicated their life to social justice causes. Their work in the community led to a nomination for the 2020 Muhammad Ali Sports Humanitarian Award, which is given to athletes who have created positive impacts in their communities. Last year, the McCourty’s along with Matthew Slater and Duron Harmon, fought to get an education bill passed in Massachusetts. In October, the Massachusetts House of Representatives and Senate unanimously passed the Student Opportunity Act. The bill will invest $1.5 billion into the states public education school system. ""That’s part of it,"" Jason McCourty said. ""When you can attack legislation and get laws and the system changed, that’s going to bring a real impact. But we can’t expect that to happen over night. It’s been hundreds of years in the process of being made the way it is."" It wasn’t long ago that peaceful protests broke out in the NFL. Started by former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick, players started to kneel during the National Anthem to bring awareness to social injustice. In 2017, following disparaging comments and tweets from President Donald Trump, Patriots players even knelt during the anthem before a game against the Houston Texans. The players were booed in Gillette Stadium for their action while people who disagreed with the action said they were disrespecting the military and country. On Sunday, Devin McCourty said it was sadly ironic that people disparaged Kaepernick while years later a black man was killed when Minneapolis, Minn., police officer Derek Chauvin knelt on his neck for 8 minutes and 46 seconds. ""Look at Kaepernick. A couple years ago, people were going crazy. ‘This guy is this, he’s that,’"" Devin McCourty said. ""Then, the irony of a man losing his life because a knee is in his neck and now, all of a sudden, people are like, oh man, let me take an extra second to listen to what Kaepernick said in an interview about why he took a knee and why he did a silent protest. ""When you listen to it, it’s like oh, that’s kind of how I feel right now after watching that video. It’s like, if you ever stopped and listen to what he was doing and his true message, it would have never got to that point and you would have never talked about the military, you would have never talked about the flag. You would’ve understood he was talking about freedom."" On the podcast, the brothers also talked with their former Rutgers teammate Chris Quaye, who is a private banker at Morgan Stanley. He talked about being an African American in a workplace where he is the overwhelming minority. Quaye, who is a part of his company’s diversity council, aims to help open doors for other minorities looking to get into the industry by educating youth. The McCourty twins spoke with former Rutgers linebacker Antonio Lowery, who is an African American police officer in Miami. He spoke about how he was taught that police offers were ‘bad’ and ‘dangerous’ while growing up. Lowery says he wants to ""change the narrative"" and he takes time to mentor kids. The brothers then spoke with Pat Brown, a former Rutgers wide receiver, who is the football coach at Seabreeze High School in Daytona Beach, Florida. He spoke about trying to bring student athletes together who come from different backgrounds in regards to race and family wealth. The McCourty twins also discussed about how people can invest in their community to make a difference and how a simple talk with someone can go a long way. ""We have to take advantage of the platform we have while we have it,"" said Jason McCourty. ""Once you retire you can do it, but it’s almost too late to demand the audience the people that you have. It just starts with a conversation."" mdaniels@providencejournal.com On Twitter: @MarkDanielsPJ",0.0

The pharmacy chain confirmed while several stores have sustained damage, no employees were hurt during the protests. ""Each closed pharmacy’s phone system has been rerouted to a nearby CVS Pharmacy that is open so all patients will continue to have access to pharmacy care,"" said Amy Thibault, senior manager of corporate communications for CVS Health.

Further follow up by the Portsmouth Police Investigative Division revealed that a male had launched a canoe in the town of Kittery sometime after midnight and paddle to Portsmouth, where he docked on a Southend pier. The male proceeded from there on foot to the middle school, carrying a propane tank in a bucket of liquid flammable. Just after 3 a.m. The mail is seen on surveillance video, smashing out the front window of the school and placing the propane bucket inside the lobby before lighting them on fire. The male then fled the area back to the canoe. Uh, Hampton Police had an interaction with this meal a little later on in the day canoeing in the ocean off the beach, and subsequent to that, the mail was arrested in rye for criminal trespass, disorderly conduct and breach of bill, an Ondo going. Investigation, basically around the clock from the Portland Police Investigative Division resulted in the arrest of Christopher M. Burger B er g er his age is 24 presently has no fixed address. He will be charged with arson, A class A felony possession of an infernal machine, which is a class A felony, reckless conduct, a class B felony breach of bill, which is a class A misdemeanor and burglary and burglary as well. Uh, so I'm gonna, uh, let the fire chief talk a little bit about what they encountered when they got to the school. And then, uh, Captain, sergeant and I will be available to answer any other questions. Would you read the charges? Sure. Way. There was a slight change that right before this came out. So it's gonna be the arson class, a felony burglary class, a felony, and then the possession of infernal machine machine. Infernal machines? Yeah. Classic Billy Bass. A felony? No, no reckless conduct. But creature bail, which is a class A misdemeanor after you know what the substance was in the bucket. Um, I'll let Chief into that. We believe it to be gasoline. It was just a flammable liquid, but we believe it to be guessed. There's still some testing being done in the lab with the assistance of A. T F and the state fire marshal's office. They have access to quicker testing that we would. It is believed, as the chief indicated, to be gasoline. But we're not gonna come out and say that until it's confirmed. Go ahead. Way responded to a fire alarm activation at the school. It Ah, little after three in the morning and our units arrived to find the fire conditions in the front for your area of the middle school, the sprinklers that activated and knocked it down to, ah, pretty good level. At that point, we finished extinguishing the fire inside the foyer and found the burned up, £20 propane tank in there. Um, we're certainly thankful that the pressure relief system on that tank activated as it was supposed to, because it did get hot enough to ventilate and release pressure. If that hadn't happened, the tank would have exploded, and it would have been a serious issue at that point, um, to the chief's remarks, the coordination between the police department and a T F State Fire marshal's office in the Fire Department investigations unit. And by all means, the help of the public with surveillance videos and so on throughout the city were able to bring this issue to a close within a week, which is which is certainly win for everybody. So what kind of damage was done you could see in the school? Describe again, kind of. So we believe again the investigation as far as the content of the materials are still underway. But we believe he used gasoline, poured the gasoline inside the smashed out a window, put the propane tank inside the doorway for gasoline around that and let that on fire. The damage to the school, thanks to the sprinklers in the quick response by the Fire Department, was limited to mostly smoking a little bit of heat damage inside the foyer, along with water damage from the sprinkler heads. The propane tanks are designed to when they're overheated, to release the pressure of the tank so as not to explode. So we know by surveillance video that that happened, that it did release the pressure, and so we kept it from exploding. Fortunately for our incoming crews that the first arriving units would have been there around the time attack would have exploded if that mechanism had failed. There's some water damage from the sprinkler heads. Um, you explain again what? What you've seen in surveillance video it Is that how you know a new triple on Kerry do differently? Eso The first piece of evidence that we had was the surveillance from the school a couple different angles. It was a camera inside a camera outside, so we were able to see that it was a younger male individual who appeared to be working alone. Um and then what really kind of sparked the investigation off into the right direction was we had a couple officers in house here that viewed the video, and they said, Jeez, that really looks like the guy we arrested last night. Although the video was not clear if to see facial, he was running his physical characteristics and some other things led the officers to believe that that was a gentleman who we had just arrested the day before. There was incident where a vehicle went up. Congress Street the wrong way. Stopped smashed out of business window with a small bat and then led us on a pursuit into Newington, where he was taken into custody. So he was taken into custody on that, uh, incident and brought to the Rockingham County Jail. He got out somewhere late at night, and then this kind of kicked off early in the morning. So we knew the timeline was possible. So he was our prime suspect, just based on the officers saying, I think that I think it's worth looking at him. And then so from there we just kind of way sought the public's attention as faras home surveillance systems and way pull all kinds of surveillance from, you know, whether it be residences or businesses in the area. And we were able to put a nice little timeline together and kind of see the individual Inter Port Smith on a canoe docked in Port Smith case. The area for a little while went back to the canoe, disembark the canoe again, this time with his tools being the you know, the flammable liquid and the propane, and then right to the school and then back to the canoe. That's the way it appears. It appears that they were with him from the beginning, although there was a possibility that he stopped somewhere in Portsmouth from his canoe ride over from way suspect from Maine. But what we know for sure is they came off the canoe with him at a particular our uh yeah, yeah, he threw it through the through it through the window. No mention of it. That's what the officers report, said Chuck Wood with some nails the night before the night before incident. Correct? Be still. Well, he had some charges. Yeah, he had some charges for both Portsmouth and Newington because in Newington, that's where the pursuit ended. That's where he resisted arrest. That's where he, um, it appeared that he might have intentionally struck a car to end the pursuit. So our charges, of course, are driving the wrong way on Congress tree, and then the criminal mischief. And then this. Will, being an officer from taking off way have a handful charges on that as well? That was how many hours before put it less than 24 plus the 12 bail reform That's a jacket. And then he dealt with four total of four police agencies in that time, actually five Fort Smith Newington. Excuse me, Fort Smith Newington. The next day, Portsmouth, Hampton, Hampton and Ride and the State Police Way with this. And then what? Able to get it like, Yeah, so it wasn't long. I shouldn't say it wasn't long. It was the following day or later that day, I should say where Hampton police took some reports off somebody canoeing just off the beach and he had capsized a few times. So generated some calls. And Hampton, they ended up taking his canoe into safekeeping. I'm not really sure what the arrangement in Hampton was. So then he skateboarded down Route one back north bound. And that's where Hey did whatever he didn't ride to bring on more charges. So he's in jail. He's in jail now. He was in jail ever since the Rye incident because one of the charges was breach of bail from are charged the night before. And then they're prosecutor was able to successfully argue dangerousness to keep him detained until another hearing. He has a lawyer. Um, I'm not sure if he does at this point, um, family's been cooperative people. Citizens around been cooperative. We, uh we expect him to be arraigned tomorrow. He's being He was arrested at the jail. Within this past hour, we'll send over press release with a photo. Um, I'm not sure who he has if anybody representing him at this time Christoph Christopher without the ER without the ER said he's got no known address. So he was originally from this area from what we're told. But then he left go to another state, and then he just recently came back to visit family. So he does. He is. Disease does not have a fixed address anywhere that we're aware of. Certainly not in the Portsmouth area. If if I could just bring one thing up. You know, folks talk about community policing and light of recent events across the country. The cooperation that we got from the business community and the public and many of our citizens. When, uh, captain sergeant sent out a press release relative to Can you please check your personal videos personal home security cameras, check and see if you're missing propane, anything like that. The cooperation that we've gotten from the citizens in Portsmouth and and our businesses in Portsmouth has been phenomenal. And that's what community policing is police working with the community and the community working with the police. And, you know, I just think it can't be overstated the type of cooperation we got from the citizens here in Portsmouth, which helped us every step of the way. Jeopardy. Is there concern about him re offending? So, yeah, so we're looking at I mean, there's obviously all issues. I mean, one of the things we talk about is a person obviously in crisis here. This was Ah, a Z Captain said less than a 24 hour period is actually less than a 12 hour period for us and then less than 24 hours involving the other three police agencies. So we're looking at issues of person in crisis which have come up repeatedly during this pandemic insurance. Get a fix. Uh, the insurance company has looked at it. They have not commented about whether the estimate and the actual are far off from that initial number, but they were contacted immediately. As far as I'm concerned, we've got top guys here in Portsmouth. Police Department has always been there. We've got a great leader at the helm. Wouldn't want have anybody else there as far as with the I was a huge advocate for the Fire Department when we went looking for a new chief and I knew Todd was gonna be the man. So far as I'm concerned, Portsmouth has exactly what it means. I don't chip years, but it doesn't necessarily mean here's staying with mayor said. You want to comment on the comments that was going on. Caplis. What's so substantive issues? What sort of a dress? Well, I think you know some of the tragedy is is, you know, with the with the riotous behaviour that's taken place is this is the first time in my career of 38 39 years doing this. That immediate response from police chiefs, police unions, police officers No one felt that the action taken by the officer in Minneapolis was lawful or justified. It was unified response across the country. We're all part of various police agencies, the police, the Fraternal Order of Police, came out the union immediately. Everybody came out and said what happened was wrong. The sad part is, is that some of these groups that have decided to turn what was a unified response by peaceful protesters into, You know, something ugly is taking away from from what's happened. The police have made huge gains across the country in police community relations and training, de escalation, bias training, all of the above. And, you know, then you have these, uh, traveling rightist groups that have taken, you know, the peaceful protest, the right to peacefully protest by people and turned it into something ugly. Yes, well, I just wanted, um, thank the media for their patients. I know. I got a lot of enquiries during this investigation. I want to thank my investigators. They lost him days off, working diligently on this case. I can't even begin to tell you how many hours went into interviews and and canvassing shorelines and different pieces of property and and just, uh, just a ton of work. Fire department put together an amazing report there. Investigators were exceptional. The state fire marshals in the came right out. They were unseen very quickly. They help you get some resource is that we don't have, and I just want to thank everybody that was involved. No one showed the timeline. Right? So he had done this stuff downtown minutes Friday, correctly 5 36 Friday evening. Does the car chase it? Sent to jail in it to morning lady. That was actually not even six. Yeah, I said, within 24 hours, it's closer to within six or eight. And then because he fled and got away and it right one. Hopefully it started and ended here in Portsmouth. And I just want to add the way he set that fire up. There's a very real potential for a violent explosion that would have it was damaged. Obviously the school greatly and probably cost firefighters live. So we're thankful that no, but there were no injuries reported. No injuries happened. Everyone walked home. And what home?

1622604339,2020-06-01 14:39:00,Biden Meets With Black Faith Leaders In Delaware Following Days Of Protest,https://www.nhpr.org/post/biden-meets-black-faith-leaders-delaware-following-days-protest,en,False,,22716,nhpr.org,http://www.nhpr.org,"In his first in-person campaign event in more than two months, presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden met Monday with community leaders at a predominantly African American church in his hometown to address the outrage and protests surrounding George Floyd's death. Protests have erupted in dozens of cities over the past week since Floyd, a black man, died after a police officer was seen on video with his knee on Floyd's neck for minutes on end. ""I think the public is getting to a place that it's never been before in understanding a lot of this,"" Biden said at the event. ""But it's going to take a whole hell of a lot of hard work. A lot of hard work. But I'm confident it can be done."" Fourteen faith leaders and local lawmakers attended the event at Bethel AME church in Wilmington, Del., as they donned masks and sat seated two to a pew to help maintain social distancing due to the coronavirus. Biden spent more than half of the event listening to the concerns of community leaders rather than delivering remarks. He could be seen taking notes as each attendee got up and spoke. Despite being in a room full of supporters, the group offered critical feedback to the former vice president, with some saying the black community didn't get the economic boost it needed under the Obama administration and that Biden's role in passing the 1994 crime bill makes some young black voters skeptical of him. There were recommendations to create a czar dedicated solely to the study of police brutality within Biden's first 100 days as president. Several speakers urged Biden to pick an African American woman as his vice president. U.S. Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester, D-Del., spoke emotionally of a recent exchange she had with a 23-year-old protester in Wilmington, who told her he was ""willing to die."" ""He said, 'I have so much rage.' And I said, 'How old are you? What's your name? How old are you?' And I just tried to hold him, COVID or not,"" the congresswoman said. After about an hour, Biden rose to address the church gathering. ""I want to make something clear: I don't expect anything from the black community,"" he said. ""It has to be earned, earned every single time."" Biden said he's spent time speaking with black thought leaders about how to move forward as a country and said people who ""don't think of themselves as having a prejudiced bone in their body"" are now reckoning with the discrimination endemic in some American institutions. ""The Band-Aid's been ripped off by this pandemic and this president. No one can pretend any longer what this is all about. Nobody can pretend who has been carrying us on our backs — it's the minorities,"" Biden said. Biden listed specific plans for his would-be administration, including heightened federal oversight over local law enforcement, additional training for police officers and increased economic opportunity for African Americans. He teased the announcement of a new economic proposal in the coming weeks, which he said will have a strong emphasis on housing, education and access to capital. ""The ultimate answer for every other group has been access to economic opportunity,"" Biden said. ""What is the future? The future is you gotta be able to get out of bed and think, 'I can make it, I can do something. The deck's not completely stacked.' "" He also stressed what he characterized as a critical need to change leadership in the Senate, particularly as it relates to confirming federal judges. ""If we don't win back the United States Senate, we're going to be in real trouble,"" Biden said. ""Presidents come and go. But I tell you what, justices don't. They last a long time."" The event ended with a prayer and Biden saying he'll rely on the group for advice throughout his campaign. ""I know I'm going to make mistakes,"" he said before quoting the expression, ""What comes from the heart goes straight to the heart."" ""It's going to come from the heart. But I'll need help,"" the former vice president said. ""I need help and advice as we go along as to what you think I should and shouldn't be doing."" The event marked Biden's third public appearance in a week, his first trips away from his home since mid-March. He has been campaigning from his house due to coronavirus lockdown orders. Biden left his home on Memorial Day to lay a wreath at a veterans park near his home, and on Sunday he visited a site in Wilmington where protesters had gathered the night before in response to Floyd's death. Biden held a virtual meeting with mayors later in the day and had virtual fundraisers planned for Monday evening. ",0.0
1622612739,2020-06-01 15:16:29,'Breeding grounds for this virus': Health experts warn large protests heighten risk of coronavirus spread,https://www.seacoastonline.com/zz/news/20200601/breeding-grounds-for-this-virus-health-experts-warn-large-protests-heighten-risk-of-coronavirus-spread?rssfeed=true,en,False,,662008,Exeter News Letter,http://www.seacoastonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/section?Category=NEWS11,"Public health officials warn new cases of COVID-19 probably will emerge after mass gatherings fueled by the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis and racial unrest in cities across America. Health experts fear carriers of coronavirus, which causes the disease, with no symptoms could unwittingly infect others at protests where social distancing is simply not taking place. The merits of the protesters' cause ""doesn’t prevent them from getting the virus,” said Bradley Pollock, chairman of the Department of Public Health Sciences at the University of California, Davis. At least one protester in Tampa, Florida, is known to have COVID-19. Tampa Police Chief Brian Dugan, who expressed dismay last week about Floyd's death, tweeted Monday that five of his officers were exposed to the protester, whom he did not identify. Protesting – especially without a mask – can put people at higher risk for infection, said Dr. Michael Mina, an assistant professor of epidemiology at Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health. ""There's no doubt in my mind that these can become breeding grounds for this virus,"" he said during a Monday media availability. ""I would not be surprised to see in the next couple of weeks that we see increases that may be linked to protests."" Viral photos: A photo page of striking moments from the week’s protests. As businesses re-open, it will be difficult to figure out whether someone caught the virus at a protest or in some other encounter, Mina said. Hopefully, the fact that protests are taking place out of doors, will dilute the virus and reduce disease transmission, he said. Wearing a mask will help reduce infections, though it won't completely eliminate risk. ""If there's a floridly positive person who is coughing and spending a whole day around a lot of other people, that person might very well get other people sick despite having a mask on,"" Mina added, but ""there's a good chance that even homemade masks will actually do quite a bit to help people not get infected and not transmit."" There is historical precedent to suggest that viruses can be spread by large public gatherings. In September 1918, people in Philadelphia held a parade to celebrate the return of soldiers from World War I. The gathering of 200,000 people, crammed shoulder to shoulder, reignited a deadly flu epidemic, leading to massive closures and thousands of deaths, records show. Yet, there's a public health cost to not protesting the status quo, said Dr. Hillary Babcock, an infectious disease specialist at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, and immediate past president of the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America. ""Systemic racism also causes large public health impacts and public health risks for large portions of our population,"" Babcock said. She disagreed with calls for protesters to stay home to avoid fueling the outbreak. ""I don't think using public health as a reason to discourage protests after these events is really appropriate,"" Babcock said. ""It's a little disingenuous to say that the health risk from protesting is somehow bigger than the health risk at Lake of Ozarks (where people gathered for fun over Memorial Day weekend) or the practices that brought us to this point in the first place."" At least one reveler at the lake party tested positive for COVID-19, according to the Camden County Health Department. Others were advised to monitor for symptoms. Babcock said it is possible to minimize the risks of protesting, with masks, social distancing and asking sick people to stay home. Arresting people and putting them into close contact with others increases risk, Babcock said, as does spraying protesters with pepper spray, which causes violent coughing and can potentially spread the virus. Timeline: George Floyd protests: How did we get here? Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency room physician and former Baltimore health commissioner, said there is risk of longer-term effects in communities disproportionately affected by COVID-19. Wen was Baltimore's health commissioner when protests erupted following the 2015 death of Freddie Gray. The death triggered civil unrest in communities already burdened with deep-seated inequities, she said. ""When over a dozen pharmacies burned down and closed and stores were looted, it was community members themselves who were affected the most,"" Wen said. While protests over the past week following Floyd's death have highlighted police-community relations, demonstrators are also calling attention to social justice issues, including health disparities. ""The same communities that are already the most affected are potentially going to have an increase in the number of cases as a result of people gathering,"" Wen said. Melanie Campbell, president of the National Coalition on Black Civic Participation, said anger in the black community has been building for years. Floyd's death spurred them to take to the streets, even as the coronavirus has taken a disproportionate toll on African Americans. ""Black people are risking their lives protesting in the middle of a pandemic that’s killing black folks. That’s real,"" she said. ""There is no convenient time to fight back."" Meanwhile, state and local public health agencies plan to monitor for new COVID-19 cases. Any large gathering during a pandemic is a concern, said John C. Welch, director of partnerships and operations for the Massachusetts Covid Response project. Partners in Health, a Boston-based nonprofit, handles Massachusetts’ contact tracing of individuals infected with or exposed to the virus. Following such a large gathering, potential cases need to be monitored over two weeks, the virus’s incubation period. “The epidemic curve should guide the response and the phased reopening of society,"" Welch said. ""Until the epidemic is declared over, social distancing and wearing masks should remain the new normal."" Peter Pitts, president and co-founder of the Center for Medicine in the Public Interest, a nonpartisan research and educational organization, said he worries COVID-19 will take advantage of people gathering to protest police violence. ""Social distancing and social conflict are a very potent negative combination when it comes to spreading a virus,"" he said. ""The timing is highly unfortunate."" Public health concerns, which are usually complicated, can easily be drowned out by other ""sexier"" stories, he said, citing the recent SpaceX launch. But the virus ""doesn't cease to be a real threat because of other threats happening simultaneously,"" he said. ""That means we have to twice as smart and twice as dedicated and twice as focused.""

The callous manner in which this arrest was carried out is reprehensible."" Now-former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin has been charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter following the fatal arrest of Floyd on May 25. A video recorded by a bystander showed Chauvin kneeling on Floyd’s neck for nearly nine minutes, as other officers stood idly by. ""I want to express my heartfelt sympathy to the family, friends and loved ones of George Floyd,"" Merner said. ""We as a police agency are deeply disturbed by what we saw on that video."" Merner said both the ""actions and inactions"" of the Minneapolis police officers recorded on video ""jeopardize the gains that have been made throughout the policing profession in our country."" Floyd’s death should be of concern ""to not only all police officers and agencies but all Americans,"" he said. ""The officers' actions are totally inconsistent with the training and protocols of our profession."" Merner continued, ""The men and women of the Portsmouth Police Department will continue to work with the community to enhance the opportunity to build the trust that is tantamount in modern day policing."" In Dover, Police Chief William Breault penned an lengthy open letter to the community on Monday.

""Now more than ever, as we move through these events together, I call on all community members to demonstrate respect and compassion for one another."" Breault said he is ""outraged and saddened"" by police actions in Minneapolis. Though occurring many states away, he said, the incident has ""eroded the very same public trust we have worked so hard to achieve."" ""What we saw occur in Minneapolis is not only completely against the mission, vision, and values of the Dover Police Department, but also the training, tactics, and professionalism with which our officers serve the community each and every day,"" he said. Breault said Dover officers receive the ""best and most current training available,"" demonstrating daily de-escalation and sound judgment. ""Please know that we as law enforcement professionals stand with you, feeling the same pain, anger, and frustration,"" said Breault. ""Let us all work together to make positive change and focus on keeping Dover a safe and peaceful place for everyone."" On Saturday, Gov. Chris Sununu issued a public statement after a Black Lives Matter protest on Elm Street in Manchester drew hundreds of people. ""This morning I called the organizers ahead of the George Floyd March in Manchester to let them know the state of New Hampshire stands with them in their calls for justice,"" said Sununu. ""This important conversation must continue and we must constructively work together as a nation to ensure there is change."" On Monday, Sununu said he has been in regular contact with New Hampshire State Police, local police departments and the National Guard ""to ensure New Hampshire remains safe.""

Over the weekend, Portsmouth Police Chief Robert Merner released a statement calling Floyd’s death ""deeply disturbing."" On behalf of members of the Portsmouth Police Department, he said, ""Law enforcement officers are trained to treat all individuals, whether they are a complainant, suspect or a defendant, with dignity and respect. The callous manner in which this arrest was carried out is reprehensible."" Now-former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin has been charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter following the fatal arrest of Floyd on May 25.

""I want to express my heartfelt sympathy to the family, friends and loved ones of George Floyd,"" Merner said. ""We as a police agency are deeply disturbed by what we saw on that video."" Merner said both the ""actions and inactions"" of the Minneapolis police officers recorded on video ""jeopardize the gains that have been made throughout the policing profession in our country.""

""Now more than ever, as we move through these events together, I call on all community members to demonstrate respect and compassion for one another.""

Health experts fear carriers of coronavirus, which causes the disease, with no symptoms could unwittingly infect others at protests where social distancing is simply not taking place. The merits of the protesters' cause ""doesn’t prevent them from getting the virus,” said Bradley Pollock, chairman of the Department of Public Health Sciences at the University of California, Davis. At least one protester in Tampa, Florida, is known to have COVID-19. Tampa Police Chief Brian Dugan, who expressed dismay last week about Floyd's death, tweeted Monday that five of his officers were exposed to the protester, whom he did not identify. Protesting – especially without a mask – can put people at higher risk for infection, said Dr. Michael Mina, an assistant professor of epidemiology at Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health. ""There's no doubt in my mind that these can become breeding grounds for this virus,"" he said during a Monday media availability. ""I would not be surprised to see in the next couple of weeks that we see increases that may be linked to protests."" Viral photos: A photo page of striking moments from the week’s protests. As businesses re-open, it will be difficult to figure out whether someone caught the virus at a protest or in some other encounter, Mina said. Hopefully, the fact that protests are taking place out of doors, will dilute the virus and reduce disease transmission, he said. Wearing a mask will help reduce infections, though it won't completely eliminate risk. ""If there's a floridly positive person who is coughing and spending a whole day around a lot of other people, that person might very well get other people sick despite having a mask on,"" Mina added, but ""there's a good chance that even homemade masks will actually do quite a bit to help people not get infected and not transmit."" There is historical precedent to suggest that viruses can be spread by large public gatherings. In September 1918, people in Philadelphia held a parade to celebrate the return of soldiers from World War I. The gathering of 200,000 people, crammed shoulder to shoulder, reignited a deadly flu epidemic, leading to massive closures and thousands of deaths, records show. Yet, there's a public health cost to not protesting the status quo, said Dr. Hillary Babcock, an infectious disease specialist at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, and immediate past president of the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America. ""Systemic racism also causes large public health impacts and public health risks for large portions of our population,"" Babcock said. She disagreed with calls for protesters to stay home to avoid fueling the outbreak. ""I don't think using public health as a reason to discourage protests after these events is really appropriate,"" Babcock said. ""It's a little disingenuous to say that the health risk from protesting is somehow bigger than the health risk at Lake of Ozarks (where people gathered for fun over Memorial Day weekend) or the practices that brought us to this point in the first place."" At least one reveler at the lake party tested positive for COVID-19, according to the Camden County Health Department. Others were advised to monitor for symptoms. Babcock said it is possible to minimize the risks of protesting, with masks, social distancing and asking sick people to stay home. Arresting people and putting them into close contact with others increases risk, Babcock said, as does spraying protesters with pepper spray, which causes violent coughing and can potentially spread the virus. Timeline: George Floyd protests: How did we get here? Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency room physician and former Baltimore health commissioner, said there is risk of longer-term effects in communities disproportionately affected by COVID-19. Wen was Baltimore's health commissioner when protests erupted following the 2015 death of Freddie Gray. The death triggered civil unrest in communities already burdened with deep-seated inequities, she said. ""When over a dozen pharmacies burned down and closed and stores were looted, it was community members themselves who were affected the most,"" Wen said. While protests over the past week following Floyd's death have highlighted police-community relations, demonstrators are also calling attention to social justice issues, including health disparities. ""The same communities that are already the most affected are potentially going to have an increase in the number of cases as a result of people gathering,"" Wen said. Melanie Campbell, president of the National Coalition on Black Civic Participation, said anger in the black community has been building for years. Floyd's death spurred them to take to the streets, even as the coronavirus has taken a disproportionate toll on African Americans. ""Black people are risking their lives protesting in the middle of a pandemic that’s killing black folks. That’s real,"" she said. ""There is no convenient time to fight back."" Meanwhile, state and local public health agencies plan to monitor for new COVID-19 cases. Any large gathering during a pandemic is a concern, said John C. Welch, director of partnerships and operations for the Massachusetts Covid Response project. Partners in Health, a Boston-based nonprofit, handles Massachusetts’ contact tracing of individuals infected with or exposed to the virus. Following such a large gathering, potential cases need to be monitored over two weeks, the virus’s incubation period. “The epidemic curve should guide the response and the phased reopening of society,"" Welch said. ""Until the epidemic is declared over, social distancing and wearing masks should remain the new normal."" Peter Pitts, president and co-founder of the Center for Medicine in the Public Interest, a nonpartisan research and educational organization, said he worries COVID-19 will take advantage of people gathering to protest police violence. ""Social distancing and social conflict are a very potent negative combination when it comes to spreading a virus,"" he said. ""The timing is highly unfortunate."" Public health concerns, which are usually complicated, can easily be drowned out by other ""sexier"" stories, he said, citing the recent SpaceX launch. But the virus ""doesn't cease to be a real threat because of other threats happening simultaneously,"" he said. ""That means we have to twice as smart and twice as dedicated and twice as focused.""

On Sunday night, the twins held a round-table discussion of the issues on their Double Coverage Podcast. For almost an hour and 15 minutes, the McCourtys interviewed multiple people who are actively trying to bring change. They also answered questions and discussed their own feelings on the ongoing racial problems in this country. ""Me and Dev just thought, with everything going on in the country, we’d spend some time just to talk about it,"" Jason McCourty said in the podcast. ""Sports is obviously something that plays a huge role in our loves, but right now sports doesn’t seem like something that is very important. There’s a lot of things going on in our country, from the pandemic to the racial issues that have gone on and plagued our country for hundreds and hundreds of years. We just wanted to open up our platform and be able to discuss some of these things."" This isn’t out of the ordinary for the McCourty twins. The brothers have dedicated their lives to the cause of social justice. Their work in the community led to a nomination for the 2020 Muhammad Ali Sports Humanitarian Award, which is given to athletes who have created positive impacts in their communities through sports. Last year, the McCourtys, along with teammates Matthew Slater and Duron Harmon, fought to get an education bill passed in Massachusetts. In October, the Massachusetts House of Representatives and Senate unanimously passed the Student Opportunity Act. The bill will invest $1.5 billion into the state’s public education school system. ""That’s part of it,"" Jason McCourty said. ""When you can attack legislation and get laws and the system changed, that’s going to bring a real impact. But we can’t expect that to happen over night. It’s been hundreds of years in the process of being made the way it is."" It wasn’t long ago that peaceful protests were seen in the NFL. Started by quarterback Colin Kaepernick, players knelt during the National Anthem to bring awareness to social injustice. In 2017, following disparaging comments and tweets from President Donald Trump, several Patriots players knelt during the anthem before a game against the Houston Texans. The players were booed in Gillette Stadium by people who disagreed with the action, saying they were disrespecting the military and the country. On Sunday, Devin McCourty talked about Kaepernick in light of the Floyd death, a black man who died when Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin knelt on his neck for 8 minutes and 46 seconds. ""Look at Kaepernick. A couple of years ago, people were going crazy. ‘This guy is this, he’s that,’ "" Devin McCourty said. ""Then, the irony of a man losing his life because a knee is on his neck and now, all of a sudden, people are like, oh man, let me take an extra second to listen to what Kaepernick said in an interview about why he took a knee and why he did a silent protest. ""When you listen to it, it’s like oh, that’s kind of how I feel right now after watching that video. It’s like, if you ever stopped and listened to what he was doing and his true message, it would have never got to that point and you would have never talked about the military, you would have never talked about the flag. You would’ve understood he was talking about freedom."" The brothers also talked with their former Rutgers teammate Chris Quaye, who is a private banker at Morgan Stanley. He talked about being an African American in a workplace where he is the overwhelming minority. Quaye, who is a part of his company’s diversity council, aims to help open doors for other minorities looking to get into the industry by educating youth. The McCourty twins spoke with former Rutgers linebacker Antonio Lowery, who is an African American police officer in Miami. He spoke about how he was taught that police officers were ""bad"" and ""dangerous"" while growing up. Lowery says he wants to ""change the narrative"" and he takes time to mentor kids. The brothers also spoke with Pat Brown, a former Rutgers wide receiver who is the football coach at Seabreeze High School in Daytona Beach, Florida. He spoke about trying to bring student-athletes together who come from different backgrounds because of race and family wealth. The McCourty twins also discussed how people can invest in their community to make a difference and how a simple talk with someone can go a long way. ""We have to take advantage of the platform we have while we have it,"" said Jason McCourty. ""Once you retire, you can do it but it’s almost too late to demand the audience the people that you have. It just starts with a conversation."" mdaniels@providencejournal.com On Twitter: @MarkDanielsPJ",0.0

ONE OF THE UNFORTUNATE COMPLICATIONS OF THIS PANDEMIC. WE HAVE TO DATE TESTED MORE THAN 74,000 PEOPLE. CURRENTLY IN THE LAST WEEK WE'RE AVERAGING ABOUT 1800 TESTS PER DAY. THERE ARE AN ADDITIONAL MORE THAN 2,100 PEOPLE CURRENTLY UNDERGOING TESTING IN OUR PUBLIC HEALTH LABORATORY SO WE'VE BEEN SUCCESSFUL AT A STATE LEVEL TO RAMP UP TESTING. WE'VE BROUGHT IN ADDITIONAL SUPPLIES FOR COVID-19 TESTING AND ARE WORKING WITH OUR COMMUNITIES AND HEALTHCARE PARTNERS TO PROMOTE INCREASED TESTING. ABOUT FOUR TO 5% OF THESE PCR-BASED TESTS EVERY DAY CONTINUE TO BE POSITIVE. ON TOP OF THAT WITH ANTIBODY-BASED TOAST, 4% TO 5% OF THE TESTS CONTINUE TO BE POSITIVE. I DO WANT TO STRESS THAT TESTING IS ONLY ONE TOOL WE HAVE TO TRY AND CONTROL THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC. INDIVIDUAL SOCIAL DISTANCING PRECAUTIONS AND GUIDANCE STILL NEEDS TO BE FOLLOWED. TO PREVENT THE SPREAD OF COVID-19 IN OUR COMMUNITIES SO WE RECOMMEND THAT WHEN PEOPLE OUT AND ABOUT CONTINUE TO PRACTICE SOCIAL DISTANCING, MAINTAINING A SAFE DISTANCE OF AT LEAST SIX FEET FROM OTHER PEOPLE AT ALL TIMES AND WHEN PEOPLE ARE IN POSITIONS OR SITUATIONS WHERE SOCIAL DISTANCING MAY NOT BE ALWAYS POSSIBLE, PLEASE WEAR A CLOTH FACE COVERING. THERE IS A LOT OF INFORMATION OUT THERE ABOUT HOW PEOPLE CAN MAKE THEIR O >> WE'LL CONTINU TO FOLLOW THE NUMBERS CLOSEL >> I HAVE NO NEW OUTBREAKS TO REPORT TODAY WHICH IS GREAT NEWS. I DID UPDATE OUR LONG TERM CARE COMPARISON TO THE OTHER NEW ENGLAND STATES JUST AS A DATA POINT. SO IN THE PAST WEEKS WE'VE COMPARED NEW HAMPSHIRE TO OTHER NEW ENGLAND STATES BOTH BY THE PERCENTAGE OF LONG TERM CARE DEATHS OR THE PERCENTAGE OF RESIDENTS LOST TO LONG TERM CARE, IN LONG TERM CARE BEDS. SO CURRENTLY, NEW HAMPSHIRE IS AT 1.5% OF OUR LONG TERM CARIES DENTS LOST TO COVID-19. COMPARATIVELY MAINE IS STILL AT 1.4. RHODE ISLAND IS AT 8.2%. NEW YORK AT 3.5%. MASSACHUSETTS 6.9%. AND CONNECTICUT 6.4%. THE OTHER DATA WE LOOK AT IS THE PERCENTAGE OF OUR LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES THAT HAVE EVEN ONE CASE OF COVID-19. IN NEW HAMPSHIRE, THAT'S 29% OF OUR FACILITIES HAVE AT LEAST ONE CASE OF COVID-19. AS A COMPARISON, RHODE ISLAND HAS 36%. NEW YORK HAS 38%, AND MASSACHUSETTS HAS 51%. SO NEW HAMPSHIRE, AGAIN HAS 29%. AS I HAVE SAID PREVIOUSLY, WHETHER WE'RE THE BEST OR THE WORST, EVERY NEGATIVE OUTCOME TO COVID-19 IN OUR LONG TERM CARE POPULATION IS DEVASTATING FOR BOTH THE RESIDENTS THAT LIVE THERE, THEIR FAMILIES, AND THE STAFF THAT CARE FOR THOSE RESIDENTS. THANK YOU. >> THANK YOU. >> JUST FINALLY, LATER THIS WEEK WE HOPE TO -- WHEN WE TALK ABOUT FLEXING THE ECONOMY, BUT WE HAVE NOTHING TO ANNOUNCE ON THAT LEVEL TODAY AND HOPEFULLY WE'LL KEEP WORKING WITH PUBLIC HEALTH TO TRY AND GET SOME ANNOUNCEMENTS LATER ON IN THE WEEK. WITH THAT WE'LL OPEN IT UP FOR QUESTIONS. >> THE PRESIDENT WIDELY REPORTED THAT HE WOULD LIKE TO SEE PROTESTS HANDLED ""THEY ARE GOING TO RUN OVER YOU AND YOU'RE GOING TO LOOK LIKE A BUNCH OF JERKS. YOU HAVE TO DOMINATE."" WHAT'S YOUR REACTION? >> WE DON'T TAKE WHETHER IT'S THE RHETORIC USED OUT OF WASHINGTON. WE ALWAYS USE FROM GUIDANCE FROM THE CDC OR GUIDANCE THAT COMES OUT BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY WE HAVE TO WORK WITHIN OUR COMMUNITIES, WITHIN OUR RHETORIC. I TRY TO STAY POSITIVE FRANKLY WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THESE THINGS. I'M NOT -- I DON'T WANT TO GET INTO THE PRESIDENT'S STATEMENT OTHER THAN TO SAY AT A NATIONAL PERSPECTIVE WE HAVE SOME CITIES UNDERGOING SOME PRETTY TOUGH SITUATIONS AND I WORK WITH THOSE MAYORS AND GOVERNORS TO FIND OUT WHAT'S HAPPENING, WHAT ISN'T WORKING, WHAT THE MESSAGING IS, WE'RE TALKING MOSTLY TO THE INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE EXPERIENCING SOME OF THESE THINGS FIRST HAND AND ON THE FRONT LINES. THE PRESIDENT'S RHETORIC IS THE PRESIDENT'S RHETORIC. >> SPECIFICALLY IS THAT APPROPRIATE FOR THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES TO TELL THEM TO DOMINATE WITH PEOPLE YOU DISAGREE WITH. >> I WOULD SAY SPEAKING FOR MYSELF, NO, I DON'T THINK ANYONE NEEDS TO BE DOMINATED. IF ANYTHING HERE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE WE'VE SHOWN WORKING TOGETHER IN A CONSTRUCTIVE AND PEACEFUL WAY IS CLEARLY A PATHWAY TO SUCCESS TO BE SURE. WHEN THE VIOLENCE THAT YOU'VE SEEN IN OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY BREAK OUT, I CAN TELL YOU WE'RE GOING TO DEAL WITH IT, ABSOLUTELY. WE HAVE FOLKS THAT WILL BE ON THE FRONT LINES WORKING SEAMLESSLY WITH LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT, STATE POLICE, NATIONAL GUARD, WHATEVER IT TAKES. WE'RE GOING TO PROTECT OUR COMMUNITIES. MAKE NO MISTAKE ABOUT IT. WE'RE JUST BEING VERY CLEAR IN THAT MESSAGE. >> ON THAT SAME FRONT THE NATIONAL GUARD IS OBVIOUSLY GEARED RIGHT NOW TO A COVID-19 RESPONSE. IF YOU DID NEED TO CALL OUT THE NATIONAL GUARD, ARE THE RESOURCES THERE OR WOULD YOU HAVE TO TAKE FROM THE COVID-19 RESPONSE IN ORDER TO RESPOND? >> THE GOOD NEWS IS, THE MEN AND WOMEN OF THE NATIONAL GUARD ARE INCREDIBLY FLEXIBLE AND THE FACT THEY CAN TRANSITION, WHETHER IT'S WORKING AT THE FOOD BANK OR TESTING CENTER OR MOBILIZING THEMSELVES ON THE FRONT LINE, OR ANYTHING OF THAT NATURE THEY CAN DO IT AND DO IT QUICKLY. I'VE BEEN SPEAKING DIRECTLY WITH THE GENERAL THROUGHOUT THE WEEKEND AND TODAY. AND WE'LL HAVE SOME OF THEM, THEY WILL BE PREPARED THE NATIONAL GUARD WILL BE READY TO GO IF CALLED UPON. IF THOSE SITUATIONS WERE TO ARISE. >> YOU MADE REFERENCE EARLIER TODAY TO PEOPLE OUTSIDE THE COMMUNITY. I KNOW YOU KNOW THEY HAVE BEEN IN CONTACT WITH BOTH THE MAYOR OF MANCHESTER AND LAW ENFORCEMENT OF MANCHESTER HAS BEEN PICKING UP TRAFFIC, COMMENTS ABOUT ENCOURAGING LOOTING IN MANCHESTER TOMORROW. COULD YOU TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT CONVERSATIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE HAD, PREPARING FOR ANY RESPONSE. DO YOU TAKE IT SERIOUSLY? >> YEAH, WE TAKE EVERYTHING SERIOUSLY. IF YOU LOOK AT THE CONVERSATIONS THAT HAPPENS SPECIALLY ON SOCIAL MEDIA, THERE ARE SOME CONVERSATIONS HAPPENING, SOME PEOPLE REFER TO IT AS THE DARK WEB AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE. WE WATCH ALL OF THAT. I CAN TELL YOU, ONE THING WE'RE REALLY HONED IN ON HERE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE IS WHETHER IT'S WORKING WITH STATE POLICE, LAW ENFORCEMENT, NATIONAL GUARD, WE'RE NOT JUST FOCUSING ON MANCHESTER OR NASHUA. OBVIOUSLY THOSE ARE TWO POTENTIAL HOTSPOT AREAS BECAUSE THEY ARE DENSELY POPULATED. WE'RE MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE PREPARED WHEREVER SOMETHING MIGHT BREAK OUT. ONE THING WE'VE SEEN IN TALKING TO OTHER GOVERNORS ACROSS THE COUNTRY IS THAT, IN SOME OF THE MORE SUBURBAN AREAS, THEY ARE GETTING HIT AS WELL WITH SOME OF THESE RIOTS AND THIS VIOLENCE. THERE SEEMS TO BE AN IDEA OR, IN SOME OF THESE AREAS, AS THE LARGER CITIES ARE REINFORCING WITH PERSONNEL AND FRONT LINE PERSONNEL TO DO WITH THE RIOTS, THAT STORM OF THESE INDIVIDUALS ARE MAKING A CALLING TO GO INTO SMALLER AREAS. AREAS WHERE, YOU KNOW, THE POLICE OR ASPECTS OF PUBLIC SAFETY CAN BE OVERRUN A LITTLE EASIER, AND SO FROM -- LEARNING FROM THOSE UNFORTUNATE INSTANCES ACROSS THE COUNTRY WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE SURE WE'RE PREPARED IN EVERY CITY AND TOWN WHATEVER IT MIGHT BE. WE'RE A SMALLER STATE THAT CAN REALLY MOBILIZE AT A VERY GRASSROOTS LEVEL AND THAT'S AN IMPORTANT TOOL FOR US. SOME OF THE LARGER STATES AND LARGER CITIES HAVE A HARDER TIME WITH THAT BUT BECAUSE WE ALREADY WORK SEAMLESSLY WITH ONE ANOTHER ON ASPECTS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT AND PUBLIC SAFETY, WE CAN HAVE A STATEWIDE PREPAREDNESS. OBVIOUSLY, SOME, TO YOUR MORE DIRECT QUESTION THERE, HAVE BEEN SOME MORE OVERT CALLS TO TAKE VIOLENT ACTION IN MANCHESTER OR NASHUA. OF COURSE, WE'RE GOING TO KEEP A LOT OF OUR EFFORTS THERE. WE KNOW SOME OF THE PROTESTS HAPPENING IN HAMPTON, TODAY, I BELIEVE THERE IS A CANDLELIGHT VIGIL IN DOVER TONIGHT. I THINK THERE MAY BE CANDLELIGHT VIGIL IN MANCHESTER HAPPENING LATER IN THE WEEK AND THERE WILL BE OTHER EVENTS. THOSE ARE IMPORTANT EVENTS. VERY POSITIVE EVENTS. THOSE ARE EVENTS THAT CARRY A VERY IMPORTANT MESSAGE FOR ALL OF US, FRANKLY. WHAT YOU DON'T WANT IS SOMETIMES WHEN THOSE EVENTS HAVE TAKEN PLACE, SIMILAR EVENTS HAVE TAKEN PLACE IN THE EVENING, IN OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY, YOU HAVE THIS OTHER ELEMENT THAT COMES IN ON THE OTHER SIDE OF IT THAT OVERSHADOWS THE POSITIVITY OF THAT EVENT. OFTEN IT'S WITH A WHOLE DIFFERENT GROUP OF INDIVIDUALS. OFTEN IT'S FROM FOLKS OUT OF STATE AND AGAIN, WE'RE JUST TRYING TO LEARN FROM THAT AND PREPARE FROM THAT AND PREPARE OURSELVES FOR THOSE POTENTIAL CONTINGENCIES, WHETHER IT'S HAMPTON, DOVER, MANCHESTER OR NEW BOSTON. I DON'T KNOW. IT COULD BE ANYWHERE. WE DON'T HAVE ANY THREATS ON NEW BOSTON BUT THE WHOLE POINT IS IT REALLY COULD HAPPEN ANYWHERE AND OUR JOB IS TO BE PREPARED FOR THAT ENTIRE SPECTRUM OF POSSIBILITIES. >> CAN YOU TALK ABOUT HOW IT'S BEEN SO FAR WITH SOME OF THE BUSINESSES ACROSS THE STATE, HOW THAT'S GONE. >> IN TERMS OF FLEXING BUSINESSES OPEN? SO FAR THE FEEDBACK HAS BEEN VERY POSITIVE. WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE GUIDANCE WE PUT OUT TO ALLOW BUSINESSES TO FLEX OPEN ARE NOT GOING TO WORK FOR EVERY BUSINESS. WE KNOW THAT, FOR EXAMPLE, EARLY ON A LOT OF THE SALON OWNERS, IT JUST DIDN'T WORK FOR THEM AND WE UNDERSTAND THAT. WE'RE ALWAYS WILLING TO LOOK AT THE POSSIBILITY OF CHANGES AND MAKING SOME ADJUSTMENTS. NO ONE HAS DONE THIS BEFORE SO GIVEN THAT WE'RE REALLY CREATING SOMETHING FROM SCRATCH, AND I THINK IT'S GONE VERY WELL. WHAT WE TRY TO LOOK AT ALSO, GIVEN OUR ABILITY TO USE OUR CONTACT TRACING AND ALL THE INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE DOING THAT WE CAN LOOK AT THE DATA THAT'S COMING OUT OF, FOR EXAMPLE, OPENING RESTAURANTS WITH OUTDOOR SEATING. ARE THERE INCIDENTS WHERE WE'RE SEEING MASSIVE OUTBREAKS WITH OUTDOOR SEATING IN RESTAURANTS OR ARE THERE INCIDENTS OF OUTBREAKS BEING DRIVEN OFF RETAILER OR SOME OTHER AREAS. ONE AREA THAT WE'RE ALL BEING VERY CAUTIOUS OF IS THE OPENING OF PLACES -- HOUSES OF WORSHIP. IT'S ONE OF THE FIRST AREAS WE'RE OPENING THAT'S ALLOWING LARGER GATHERINGS TO HAPPEN. WE'RE ALLOWING UP TO 40% CAPACITY. WHICH SHOULD STILL ALLOW FOR THAT PHYSICAL DISTANCING, AND THERE ARE SOME OTHER GUIDANCE THAT'S BEING PUT IN THERE TO LIMIT A LOT OF THE PHYSICAL CONTACT THAT CAN OFTEN LEAD TO THE TRANSPIRING OF THE VIRUS. SO WE'RE STILL TRYING TO PUT A LOT OF GOOD GUIDANCE IN PLACE BUT WE'LL BE KEEPING AN EYE ON THOSE NUMBERS. THE FACT THAT FOLKS AT PUBLIC HEALTH HAVE DONE A GREAT JOB KEEPING THE CONTACT TRACING NOT JUST AVAILABLE BUT ACTUALLY INCREASING OUR ABILITY TO DO IT WILL JUST ALLOW US TO BE A LITTLE MORE PROACTIVE ON THE DATA AS WE GET IT SO WE CAN MAKE ADJUSTMENTS AT A MICROLEVEL AS OPPOSED TO SAYING WE'RE SEEING AN OUTBREAK AND WE'RE GOING TO SHUT IT DOWN. THAT'S NOT GOING TO BE A GOOD PATHWAY FOR ANYONE. THE BEST WAY TO MITIGATE THAT IS WITH DATA. I ALWAYS SAY DATA TRUMPS MODEL AND THAT'S ONE OF THE BIGGEST ASSETS THAT WE HAVE NOW. >> STAY AT HOME 2.0, WATCHING THE NUMBERS, HAVE YOU SEEN ANY APPRECIABLE CHANGE OR HAS THERE BEEN ANY KIND OF NOTABLE UPTAKE COMING OUT OF HAIRDRESSERS OR ANY AREA OF REOPENING? >> THAT'S THE GREAT QUESTION. HAVE WE SEEN ANYTHING IN THE DATA? THE GOVERNOR IS ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. WE'RE WATCHING THE DATA VERY CLOSELY ON A LOT OF THE DECISIONS GOING FORWARD. NOT NECESSARILY MODELING WHICH, YOU KNOW, SORT OF LOOKS AT THEORETICAL POSSIBILITIES, MANY OF WHICH ARE NOT USUALLY ACCURATE. WE'LL FOLLOW THE DATA CLOSELY. A LOT OF THE REOPENINGS THAT HAVE HAPPENED HAS BEEN WITHIN THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS. SOMETIMES IT CAN TAKE TWO TO THREE WEEKS TO REALLY SEE A CHANGE IN THE DATA AND A CHANGE IN THE NUMBERS. WE'LL BE WATCHING THAT VERY CLOSELY GOING FORWARD OVER THE NEXT TWO OR THREE WEEKS. WE HAVEN'T SEEN YET ANY SUBSTANTIAL INCREASES IN THE NUMBERS, CHANGES IN THE PERCENT OF TESTS THAT ARE POSITIVE. STILL ABOUT 4ERS TO 5% OF THE PCR-BASED TESTS THAT REMAIN POSITIVE, OBVIOUSLY DOWN FROM 10% TO 12% WHERE WE WERE, FOUR TO SIX WEEKS AGO. OVERALL, OVER THE LAST SEVERAL WEEKS THE NUMBER OF HOSPITALIZATIONS, WHEN YOU LOOK AT GRAPHS OF PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN HOSPITALIZED BY DATE OF ADMISSION, DATE OF HOSPITALIZATION HAS SHOWN A SLOW TREND. THAT'S SOME OF THE DATA THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT. I'M GETTING UP ON THE DATA DASHBOARD IN THE COMING WEEKS. THIS KIND OF DATA CAN BE MORE READILY AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC. THAT'S THE TYPE OF DATA WE'RE FOLLOWING AND IT'S SHOWING AN IMPROVEMENT BUT WE HAVEN'T SEEN ANY SUBSTANTIAL UPTICKS OR INCREASES YET IN THE NUMBERS. THAT'S A CONCERN AND A REAL POSSIBILITY ESPECIALLY AS SOME BUSINESSES REOPEN AND THE WEATHER IS NICE, PEOPLE ARE OUT THERE, INTERACTING, WE WANT TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE CONTINUE TO DO SO SAFELY AND TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THOSE OPPORTUNITIES SAFELY, THAT THE BUSINESSES ARE IMPLEMENTING THE GUIDANCE THAT'S OUT THERE AND THE INDIVIDUALS, ON AN INDIVIDUAL LEVEL, ARE TAKING THEIR OWN PART OF PRACTICING SOCIAL DISTANCING, AND WEARING CLOTH-BASED COVERINGS IN SITUATIONS WHERE THAT MAY BE DIFFICULT TO DO SO WE HAVEN'T SEEN ANY TRENDS IN INCREASING TRANSMISSION YET. THAT'S SOMETHING WE FOLLOW OVER THE COURSE OF TWO TO THREE WEEKS BUT WE'LL BE WATCHING THAT VERY CLOSELY. THANKS. CAN WE TAKE A FEW QUESTIONS ON THE PHONE? >> FIRST QUESTION FROM ASSOCIATED PRESS. HOLLY GO, AHEAD WITH YOUR QUESTION. >> THANK YOU. >> I HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT THE ANTIBODY TESTING. DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTION OF THOSE TESTING POSITIVE FOR ANTIBODIES, MAY BE PEOPLE WHO COULDN'T GET TESTED EARLY ON VERSUS PEOPLE WHO NEVER WERE TESTED? >> THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION. IT'S ABOUT ANTIBODY TESTS AND DO WE KNOW SPECIFIC SITUATIONS FOR HOW MANY OF THESE PEOPLE THAT ARE GETTING TESTED MIGHT HAVE BEEN SYMPTOMATIC IN THE PAST VERSUS, YOU KNOW, NOT HAVING ANY SYMPTOMS. UNFORTUNATELY WE DON'T HAVE DETAILS DOWN TO THAT LEVEL. WE'RE, ON AVERAGE, DOING ABOUT 300 ANTIBODY TESTS PER DAY IN THE STATE. I ALSO WANT TO TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO CLARIFY AGAIN, ANTIBODY TESTS ARE INTENDED TO PREDICT, OR NOT TO PREDICT BUT TO SHOW POTENTIAL PAST INFECTION WITH THE NOVEL CORONAVIRUS CAUSING COVID-19. AN ANTIBODY TEST IS NOT INTENDED TO DIAGNOSE OR TO TELL SOMEBODY IF THEY ARE ACTIVELY INFECTED. IT CAN TAKE UPWARDS OF A COUPLE OF WEEKS FOR SOMEONE'S BODY TO PRODUCE THESE ANTIBODIES AFTER THEY ARE INFECTED. SO THE REAL ROLE OF THESE ANTIBODY TESTS IS TO INFORM PUBLIC HEALTH ABOUT PAST INFECTION. WE DON'T HAVE DATA REGARDING, YOU KNOW, THESE APPROXIMATELY 300 PEOPLE PER DAY ON AVERAGE THAT ARE BEING TESTED. WE DON'T HAVE DATA IF THESE ARE INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE SYMPTOMATIC IN THE PAST VERSUS ASYMPTOMATIC. NOT HAVING SYMPTOMS BUT JUST WANT TO KNOW WHETHER THEY ARE INFECTED. I DO WANT TO STRESS THAT AN ANTIBODY TEST, AGAIN, IS INTENDED TO HELP US UNDERSTAND POPULATION LEVELS OF PAST INFECTION. WE DON'T KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT THESE TESTS YET FOR THEM TO BE ROLLED OUT FOR INFORMING PALESTINIAN CAL USE. INDIVIDUAL DECISIONS ABOUT PROTECTION, SO IF SOMEBODY IS POSITIVE, WE DON'T KNOW HOW THAT, YOU KNOW, POSITIVE TEST TRANSLATES TO WHETHER THEY ARE PROTECTED OR NOT OR HOW LONG SOMEONE IS PROTECTED FOR. THERE ARE ONGOING STUDIES BEING CONDUCTED. I KNOW IN OTHER STATES AND BY THE CDC AT A NATIONAL LEVEL TO LOOK AT THESE ANTIBODY-BASED TESTS AND HOW WE CAN USE THEM TO PREDICT SOMEONE'S IMMUNITY AND SOMEONE'S PROTECTION TO THE VIRUS BUT UNFORTUNATELY WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH INFORMATION YET AT THIS POINT TO USE THOSE ANTIBODY-BASED TESTS TO HELP INFORM WHETHER SOMEONE IS PROTECTED. IF THEY ARE POSITIVE BY THESE TESTS. THANKS. >> THE NEXT QUESTION COMES FROM PAUL -- PAUL GO, AHEAD WITH YOUR QUESTION. >> HI. WITH MANY COMMUNITIES CHOOSING TO NOT OPEN THEIR POOLS THIS SUMMER I WONDER IF THERE WAS CONCERN ABOUT, YOU KNOW, PEOPLE SWIMMING IN UNSUPERVISED AREAS AND ADDITIONAL EFFORTS TO BE TAKEN -- ENSURE SAFETY IN PONDS, RIVERS, THAT SORT OF THING? >> IT'S A VERY GOOD QUESTION. I THINK AS A LOT OF FOLKS KNOW WE HAD TWO VERY UNFORTUNATE FATALITIES THIS WEE OF SWIMMING. EVERY YEAR IN NEW HAMPSHIRE WE TRY TO PUT OUT A VERY STRONG MESSAGE AND THIS YEAR WILL BE NO DIFFERENT IN TERMS OF THE WARNINGS WE TRY TO INSTILL UPON FOLKS NOT JUST ON THE SEA COAST COMMUNITIES. A LOT OF FOLKS KNOW IN HAMPTON BEACH THERE CAN BE A STRONG UNDERTOW AND CURRENT. BUT ESPECIALLY, OUR LAKES AND RIVERS. WE HAVE A LOT OF FOLKS THAT MIGHT GO TUBING IN RIVERS. THERE CAN BE UNDERTOWS AND CURRENTS THERE. CAN BE ROCKS UNDERNEATH THAT HAVE CAUSED SERIOUS INJURIES AND UNFORTUNATELY FATALITIES IN THE PAST. SO WE'LL MAKE SURE THAT THAT MESSAGE CONTINUES TO BE A HEIGHTENED ONE. THOSE WARNINGS CONTINUE TO GO OUT, YOU KNOW. I DON'T KNOW IF THERE IS A DIRECT -- HOW MUCH OF A DIRECT RELATION THERE IS BETWEEN THE CLOSING OF THE POOLS AND PEOPLE SWIMMING IN RIVERS. OBVIOUSLY WE JUST KNOW IT'S ALWAYS AN ISSUE HERE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE AND THERE ALWAYS HAS TO BE AN ELEVATED MESSAGE AND WE'LL CONTINUE TO DO SO THIS SUMMER AS WELL. >> THE NEXT QUESTION FROM PAULA AND IN DEPTH. PAUL LARKS GO AHEAD WITH YOUR QUESTION. >> GOOD AFTERNOON, GOVERNOR. I HAVE A QUESTION, I THINK IT'S PROBABLY FOR JEANETTE ON THE STATUS OF NURSING HOME RESULTS. LAST WEEK SHE SAID 95% -- [INAUDIBLE] >> I WOULD STILL LIKE TO GET A CLEAR PICTURE OF THAT DATELINE INFORMATION. I ALSO NOTED IN THE DASHBOARD THAT AS OF THE 30TH, THE 202 OF OUR 47 DEATHS WERE IN CLUSTER OUTBREAKS. IS THAT CORRECT? OR IS IT JUST -- I'M JUST WONDERING WHY ARE WE FACING SUCH HIGH PERCENTAGES, COMPARED TO EVEN OTHER STATES? IN OUR NURSING HOME DEATHS? AND I ALSO HAD A QUESTION ABOUT CONTACT TRACING. ARE WE UP TO SNUFF WITH THAT? HOW MANY FOLKS DO WE HAVE DOING THAT? ARE THEY BEHIND OR KEEPING UP WITH DEMAND? >> ALL RIGHT. LET ME SEE IF I CAN ADDRESS MOST OF THOSE QUESTIONS. BASELINE AT THE TIMING FOR NURSING HOMES, ALL THE SPECIMENS HAVE BEEN COLLECTED AND ARE AT PUBLIC HEALTH LAB. WE RECEIVED THE LAST OF THEM OVER FRIDAY AND SATURDAY, SO IF THEY ARE NOT ALL REPORTED OUT BY TODAY IT SHOULD BE TOMORROW. WE BEGIN OUR SENTINEL BASELINE TESTING. WE'RE RIGHT IN THAT TRANSITION WEEK BETWEEN THE STATE DOING IT AND HAVING OTHER PARTNERS DOING IT SO FOR THIS WEEK WE'RE GOING TO KIND OF STEP IN WITH A SECONDARY PROGRAM TO GET THAT SURVEILLANCE TESTING STARTED, SO WHAT THAT IS IS 10% OF RESIDENTS IN NURSING HOMES, AND ALL STAFF TESTED BETWEEN SEVEN AND 12 DAYS WITH THE HOPE OF THE AVERAGE BEING 10. THE DEATH NUMBER -- THE 202 IN CLUSTERS, CLUSTERS ARE NOT JUST LONG TERM CARE. THEY CAN BE ANYTHING FROM HOSPITAL CLUSTERS TO RESIDENTIAL PROGRAMS THAT HAVE CLUSTERS. BUT THE MAJORITY OF ARE LONG TERM CARE. YOU MENTIONED -- WHY IS OUR DEATH RATE SO HIGH? I JUST READ OFF OUR NUMBERS AS COMPARED TO OTHER STATES. I HAD SAID THAT, THE NUMBERS THAT WE TRACK IS THE PERCENTAGE OF LONG TERM CARIES DENTS LOST TO DEATH AS COMPARED TO OUR OVERALL BED SIZE. SO NEW HAMPSHIRE HAS 1.5% OF OUR RESIDENTS IN LONG TERM CARE THAT HAVE BEEN LOST TO COVID-19 DEATH. COMPARING THAT TO OTHER STATES, RHODE ISLAND IS AT 8.2, NEW YORK, 3.5, MASSACHUSETTS 6.9, AND CONNECTICUT 6.4. SO WE'RE NOT -- WE'RE NOT WORSE THAN OTHER STATES. IT REALLY DEPENDS ON THE DATA POINT THAT YOU PICK TO COMPARE. WHEN YOU COMPARE LONG TERM CARE DEATHS AS A PERCENTAGE OF OUR OVERALL DEATHS, WE ARE HIGH BECAUSE WE'VE HAD VERY LOW DEATHS IN OUR COMMUNITY TRANSMISSIONS. CONTACT TRACING, WE HAVE BETWEEN A HUNDRED AND 130 PEOPLE DOING CONTACT TRACING. WE'VE BEEN SUPPLEMENTED BY MANY OF OUR HEALTHCARE PARTNERS, OUR NATIONAL GUARD STAFF. WE'RE NOT BEHIND. WE'RE DEFINITELY ON TIME. THERE HAVE BEEN TIMES, YOU KNOW, I SAW THIS ON SOCIAL MEDIA OVER THE WEEKEND WHERE SOMEONE SAID ON ONE OF OUR POSTS, IT'S BEEN TWO DAYS AND I HAVEN'T BEEN CONTACTED, BUT I WAS TESTED IN ANOTHER STATE. AND SOMETIMES WHEN YOU'RE TESTED IN ANOTHER STATE, LET'S SAY MASSACHUSETTS, IT COULD TAKE LONGER FOR ONE OF THOSE PUBLIC HEALTH LABS TO CONTACT NEW HAMPSHIRE. SO MY MESSAGING TO ANY CITIZENS OUT THERE THAT HAVE RECEIVED A POSITIVE TEST RESULT FROM ANY LAB AT ALL, IF YOU HAVE NOT BEEN CONTACTED BY PUBLIC HEALTH, THEN THERE IS PROBABLY A PROBLEM. EITHER WE DID NOT GET THAT TEST RESULT OR THERE HAS BEEN A DELAY COMING FROM THE LAB. SO REACH OUT TO PUBLIC HEALTH YOURSELF AND CONTACT. WE'VE HAD VERY, VERY FEW PEOPLE THAT THAT'S EVER HAPPENED TO BUT IF YOU'RE ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE YO SHOULD ABSOLUTELY REACH OUT. >> THE NEXT QUESTION COMES FROM MICHAEL GRAHAM. MICHAEL, GO AHEAD WITH YOUR QUESTION. >> THE GOVERNOR HAS SPOKEN VERY PASSIONATELY ABOUT RACIAL JUSTICE, WHICH HAS RAISED A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS. -- ONE IS GATHERING IN VIOLATION. IT MAKES PEOPLE ASK WHAT THE PRIORITY IS HERE, WHICH ENCOURAGES OTHER GROUPS TO GATHER A THOUSAND AT A TIME IN NONSOCIAL DISTANCING WAYS. THE SECOND QUESTION IS, DO YOU HAVE ANY CONCERNS ABOUT THE DATA THAT SHOWS THE STAY AT HOME SHUTDOWN OF BUSINESSES IS WILDLY DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTING BLACK AND HISPANIC BUSINESS OWNERS? THE ""WASHINGTON POST"" REPORTS THAT 40% OF WORKING BLACK BUSINESS OWNERS ARE OUT OF BUSINESS UNDER THE LOCKDOWN NATIONWIDE. WE DON'T HAV DATA. DOES THAT CONCERN YOU. THEY WANT MORE OPPORTUNITIES TO GET BACK TO WORK -- [INAUDIBLE] >> LET ME ANSWER THE SECOND PART OF THAT QUESTION FIRST ABOUT THE DISPROPORTIONATE NUMBER OF APPARENTLY BUSINESSES, IT SOUNDS LIKE THAT ARE OWNED AND RUN BY MINORITY BEING DISPROPORTIONATELY NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY STAY AT HOME ORDERS NATIONALLY. I HAVE NOT SEEN THAT DATA. IT'S A NATIONAL PIECE OF DATA IT SOUNDS LIKE. I DON'T KNOW IF WE HAVE THE DATA FOR NEW HAMPSHIRE AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE PROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED BUSINESSES DUE TO THE STAY AT HOME ORDER, AND THE SHUTDOWN OF BUSINESSES HERE, TEMPORARY SHUTDOWN, IS ON THAT SAME PATH OF DISPROPORTIONALITY. I HAVEN'T SEEN THAT TO BE HONEST. I JUST WANT TO ANSWER THE QUESTION AND SAY I HAVEN'T SEEN THE DATA. IT'S SOMETHING WE CAN LOOK INTO. WE'VE SET UP A TASK FORCE TO LOOK AT THE DISPARITY OF COVID-19 WITHIN MINORITY COMMUNITIES. TO SEE, BECAUSE WE DO BELIEVE THAT RIGHT NOW THE DATA DOES SHOW HERE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE AND NATIONALLY, THAT IT DOES HAVE A DISPROPORTIONATE NEGATIVE HEALTH EFFECT. WHAT ARE THE DRIVERS BEHIND THAT? WHAT CAN WE DO ABOUT KNIT WHAT ARE THE SUGGESTIONS WITHIN CERTAIN COMMUNITIES AROUND NEW HAMPSHIRE, AND THE STEPS THAT WE CAN TAKE AS A STATE TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT DISPROPORTIONALITY DOESN'T EXIST FROM A HEALTHCARE STANDPOINT, I THINK IS A VERY IMPORTANT DISCUSSION. I HAVEN'T HEARD OF THE DATA ON THE BUSINESSES TO BE HONEST SO I HESITATE TO ANSWER THAT I HAVEN'T SEEN THAT IN NEW HAMPSHIRE. IT MAY EXIST BUT I HAVEN'T SEEN IT BUT IT'S SOMETHING WE CAN LOOK INTO. THE FIRST PART OF YOUR QUESTION. THOSE THAT WANT TO COMPARE SOCIAL INJUSTICES, THE ISSUES SURROUNDING THE MURDER OF GEORGE FLOYD TO THE EFFECTIVENESS OF A STAY AT HOME ORDER AND SOCIAL GATHERINGS ARE COMPLETELY MISSING THE POINT. THEY ARE TWO COMPLETELY SEPARATE ISSUES, AND THOSE THAT TRY TO COMBINE THOSE TWO ISSUES, WHETHER IT'S A LARGE GATHERING OF INDIVIDUALS, WHO FRANKLY, I THINK, DID A TERRIFIC JOB OF WEARING MASKS, APPRECIATING THE IMPORTANCE OF THE MOMENT, BUT NOT FORGETTING ABOUT THE FACT THAT WE'RE IN A PANDEMIC. I THINK THEY DID A VERY GOOD JOB HERE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE. WE SAW A LOT OF FOLKS WEARING MASKS FOR THAT, AND INDIVIDUALS TRYING TO CONFLATE THAT WITH THE STAY AT HOME ORDER AND RESTRICTING ON SOCIAL DISTANCING, THEY ARE DOING AN ABSOLUTE DISSERVICE TO THE IMPORTANCE OF THE MESSAGE AROUND THOSE PROTESTS. THE IMPORTANCE OF THE MESSAGE AROUND THE INJUSTICES. YES, THAT WAS A SINGLE EVENT IN THOSE COMMUNITIES. THERE MAY BE MORE DOWN THE ROAD TO BE SURE BUT THAT WAS A SINGLE EVENT IN THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT WAS, FRANKLY, GOING TO HAPPEN WHETHER WE APPROVED OF IT OR SAID, SIR, YOU CAN'T DO IT -- SORRY, YOU'RE IN A GROUP LARGER THAN 10. THAT EVENT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN AND FRANKLY, IT SHOULD HAVE HAPPENED AND IT SHOULD HAPPEN IN A POSITIVE AND CONSTRUCTIVE WAY AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT BOTH THE FOLKS IN MANCHESTER, THE MANCHESTER POLICE DEPARTMENT, THE CHIEF, MYSELF, REACHING OUT TO THEM, PROACTIVELY, MAKING SURE THAT THEY UNDERSTOOD THAT WE WERE SUPPORTIVE OF IT. THOSE STEPS WERE TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT IT WENT OFF PEACEFULLY AND CONSTRUCTIVELY AND IT WANT JUST A ONE DAY EVENT BUT THE BEGINNING OF A DISCUSSION OF AN ONGOING DISCUSSION THAT WE HAVE TO CONTINUALLY HAVE IN OUR COMMUNITIES WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT. REALLY AT GRASSROOTS LEVEL AND ONE-ON-ONE LEVEL. TRYING TO CONFLATE THOSE TWO ISSUES YOU'RE MISSING THE POINT. YOU REALLY ARE. >> THE COMES IN QUESTION COMES FROM TONY. GO AHEAD WITH YOUR QUESTION. >> A QUICK STATEMENT AND THEN A QUESTION. FIRST-OFF, DATA DASHBOARD IS GREAT. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR GETTING THAT UP AND RUNNING. SECONDLY, GOVERNOR, YOU KNOW NEW HAMPSHIRE HAS THE STAND YOUR GROUND, OPEN CARRY, WHEREAS MANY OF THE COMMUNITIES AROUND THE COUNTRY THAT ARE LITERALLY EXPLODING WITH THE VIOLENCE AND SHOP OWNERS BEING ASSAULTED AND EVEN KILLED TRYING TO PROTECT THEIR PROPERTY AND BUSINESSES AND PLACES WITH STRICT GUN CONTROL LAWS, WHEN YOU'RE ON THE CALL, LIKE YOU SAID, I WAS ON CALL WITH THE OTHER GOVERNORS SUNDAY NIGHT, HAVE SECOND AMENDMENT PERSONAL PROTECTION RIGHTS BEEN DISCUSSED IN ANY WAY AND ARE YOU OR ANY STATE OFFICIAL CONCERNED WITH THE POTENTIAL -- FUTURE RIOTING INCIDENTS, WE HOPE IT DOESN'T COME HERE AND BUSINESS OWNERS WHO MIGHT BE PROTECTING THEMSELVES AND THEIR PROPERTY HERE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE. >> I CAN TELL YOU IN ALL THE CONVERSATIONS THAT WE'VE HAD, NATIONALLY WITH MAYORS AND GOVERNORS AND THE ADMINISTRATION, THE ISSUE OF SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHTS AND GUN OWNERS' RIGHTS HAS NOT COMING UP IN ANY WAY, FRANKLY. WE TALK MORE ABOUT THE VALUE OF THE MESSAGING, CONSTRUCTIVE WAYS OF DEALING WITH THE ISSUES, WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE VIOLENCE AND THE RIOTING. SOME OF THE STRATEGIES THAT HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED BOTH SUCCESSFULLY AND UNSUCCESSFULLY IN VARIOUS PARTS OF THE COUNTRY AND WE TRY TO LEARN FROM THEM. NO, THERE HASN'T BEEN ANY REAL DISCUSSION AROUND SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHTS PER SE. DOES IT CONCERN US THAT INDIVIDUALS MAY TRY TO PROTECT THEIR BUSINESSES WITH A FIREARM AND ALL OF THAT? LOOK GOD FORBID IF WE SHOULD BE IN A SITUATION OF RIOTING AND VIOLENCE, YOU KNOW, MY JOB IS TO MAKE SURE THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT IS THERE WORKING SEAMLESSLY FROM THE STATE LEVEL, LOCAL LEVEL, NATIONAL GUARD, WHATEVER IT TAKES, SO WE'RE -- SO THAT WE'RE ON THE FRONT LINES PROTECTING THOSE INDIVIDUALS AND THOSE BUSINESSES THAT PROPERTY, AND IT DOESN'T COME TO A SITUATION WHERE INDIVIDUAL, YOU KNOW, ARE PUT INTO A SITUATION WHERE THEY HAVE TO DEFEND THEMSELVES WITH THEIR FIREARMS. SO OBVIOUSLY, YOU KNOW, ANY TIME YOU'RE IN A SITUATION WHERE A CITIZEN MAY HAVE TO USE A FIREARM TO PROTECT THEMSELVES THAT'S A BAD SITUATION, RIGHT? THAT'S A -- THAT'S A TROUBLING SITUATION FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS, AND SO WE'RE LOOKING AT ALL ASPECTS TO BE SURE AND ENGAGING WITH ALL ASPECTS OF NOT JUST LAW ENFORCEMENT BUT MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY TO MAKE SURE WE MITIGATE THAT SITUATION BEFORE IT EVEN STARTS. >> THE NEXT QUESTION COMES FROM RICK. GO AHEAD WITH YOUR QUESTION. >> YES. THANKS. >> REGARDING THE NURSING HOME AND LONG TERM CARE SETTINGS, I WANT TO ASK YOU TO STEP BACK A LITTLE BIT AND GIVE US SOME OVERVIEW. MOST OF THE DEATHS HAVE OCCURRED IN LONG TERM CARE SETTINGS, MOST OF THOSE IN NURSING HOMES. HAVE YOU BEEN ABLE DO -- THE BASELINE TESTING YOU'VE DONE OR THE OTHER INFORMATION THAT YOU HAVE, KIND OF TRACE OUT THE COURSE OF THE EPIDEMIC IN THAT SETTING, AND FEEL THAT YOU HAVE A STRATEGY THAT C SOMEHOW BREAK THAT CHAIN AND ZERO OUT THE ISSUES AMONG STAFF AND RESIDENTS. THAT'S MY QUESTION. >> THANK YOU. >> OUR STRATEGY HAS CHANGED THROUGH THE MONTHS AS IT SHOULD, AS WE'VE LEARNED MORE ABOUT THE VIRUS. OUR BASELINE TESTING HAS REVEALED SOME ASYMPTOMATIC POSITIVE BOTH IN STAFF AND IN RESIDENTS. AS WE LOOK AT IT AND I'VE TALKED TO A LOT OF ADMINISTRATORS OF A LOT OF FACILITIES ABOUT THIS, AND, YOU KNOW, A COUPLE OF THEM ARE REALLY SURPRISED BECAUSE THEY WERE GETTING THEIR BASELINE AT THE TIMING DONE OR THEY HAD ONE PERSON WITH VERY MILD SYMPTOMS AND THEY WOULD COME IN AND HAVE 20 POSITIVES. EVENING AMONGST RESIDENTS THAT NEVER BECAME SYMPTOMATIC. SOME OBVIOUSLY DID BECOME SYMPTOMATIC AND GOT VERY ILL BUT A GOOD AMOUNT OF THE RESIDENTS DIDN'T BECOME ILL AT ALL AND THAT WAS THE SAME WITH THE STAFF. SO IF THERE IS ONE TREND THAT WE'RE DEFINITELY SEEING IS THE AMOUNT OF ASYMPTOMATIC POSITIVE TESTING CASES THAT WE' FINDING BOTH AMONGST LONG TERM CARE AND STAFF. ONE OF THE STRATEGIES THAT WE'VE CHANGED, INITIALLY WHEN WE STARTED DOING LONG TERM CARE, WE WERE TESTING SYMPTOMATIC PEOPLE AND THEN WE MOVED TO, AS SOON AS YOU GET A POSITIVE TEST, TESTING ALL THE RESIDENTS, AND THEN ALL OF THE STAFF. NOW WE'RE AT A POINT WHEN YOU HAVE A POSITIVE CASE WE'RE TESTING ALL RESIDENTS AND STAFF EITHER ON THE UNIT IF IT'S CONTAINED OR BUILDING WIDE, AND THEN WE'RE GOING BACK ABOUT EVERY FIVE TO SEVEN DAYS AND WE'RE TESTING EVERYBODY AGAIN THAT TESTED NEGATIVE. AND WE CONTINUE TO DO THAT EVERY FIVE TO SEVEN DAYS BECAUSE WHAT WE FOUND IN SOME OF OUR BIGGER OUTBREAKS, THAT WE WERE GOING TO THEIR BUILDING, TWICE A WEEK ANYWAY'S, FOR SYMPTOMATIC TESTING, WITH OUR TEAM, WITH THE RAPID TEST. SO NOW WE'RE JUST PUTTING IT ON A SCHEDULE TO GO OUT EVERY FIVE TO SEVEN DAYS TO TEST ANYBODY THAT HAD NOT TESTED POSITIVE WITHIN THAT GROUP. THAT'S OUR STRATEGY RIGHT NOW, FOR TRYING TO LIMIT THE SPREAD AND REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF NEGATIVE OUTCOMES. BUT WE'RE STILL FIGHTING THE INVISIBLE ENEMY. WE DON'T SEE IT. SO IT'S REALLY, REALLY TOUGH, BECAUSE THE RESIDENTS ARE NOT GOING OUT OF THE BUILDING, BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT GETTING VISITORS, THE TWO WAYS THAT WE HAVE FOUND THAT IT'S COME INTO THE BUILDING, EITHER BY A NEW ADMISSION FROM A HOSPITAL THAT TESTED NEGATIVE AT THE HOSPITAL, AND THEN, YOU KNOW, FIVE TO SEVEN DAYS AFTER GETTING TO THE NURSING HOME, BECAME SYMPTOMATIC AND TESTED POSITIVE, OR THROUGH ASYMPTOMATIC STAFF TRANSMISSION TO THE RESIDENTS. THOSE ARE THE TWO MAIN WAYS WE'RE SEEING IT GET INTO THE FACILITIES. >> THANK YOU GUYS VERY MUCH. ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS WITHIN THE ROOM? >> FOR TWO MONTHS, THE MANTRA WAS, WHY SHOULDN'T EVERYBODY WANT TO TEST GET A TEST? NOW, EVERYBODY CAN. I MEAN, WHAT'S KIND OF THE EXPECTATION THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN NOW? IS THAT IT THERE IS GOING TO BE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO WEREN'T ABLE TO GET A TEST ARE GOING TO FLOOD THE SYSTEM, OR HAVE MOST OF THE PEOPLE, BECAUSE OF RISK, AMONG ALL THE OTHER VARIABLES THAT YOU'VE HAD TO THIS POINT, MOST OF THE PEOPLE WHO THOUGHT THEY NEEDED A TEST HAVE ALREADY GOTTEN ONE. >> I CAN TELL YOU, I'M ACTUALLY SURPRISED IF THAT WE'VE OPENED UP THE ABILITY TO TEST AND NOT AS MANY PEOPLE ARE STEPPING FORWARD THAT WANT TO TEST. SO WE'RE REALLY ENCOURAGING PEOPLE TO STEP FORWARD AND BE TESTED. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THAT WHILE THE VAST MAJORITY, THE FATALITIES ARE WITHIN LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES AND, I WANT TO SAY ABOUT 35% TO 40% OF THE POSITIVE CASES I THINK RIGHT NOW ARE COMING OUT OF LONG TERM CARE IS THAT ABOUT RIGHT? >> 40, MAYBE A LITTLE HIGHER NOW, 40% OR MORE, YOU KNOW, THERE IS ALSO A LOT OF COMMUNITY-BASED TRANSMISSION AS WELL. IT'S OUT THERE. WE WON'T -- EVEN IF YOU DUE QUALIFY UNDER THOSE ISN'T THEIR OWES AND ASYMPTOMATIC YOU CAN BE TESTED. WE WANT FOLKS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT. IF YOU WANT A TEST GO GET A TEST REALLY. >> ONE FINAL ONE FOR DR. CHAN. TALKING WITH OTHER EPIDEMIOLOGISTS AROUND THE COUNTRY AND THE WORLD, NOW THAT WE'VE BEEN IN THIS FOR A FEW MONTHS IS THERE ANYTHING MORE? IS THIS CORONAVIRUS BEHAVING LIKE ANY OTHER CORONAVIRUS? IS THERE A COROLLARY OR LINING UP SO THAT YOU CAN KNOW MORE ABOUT IT? >> WE DEFINITELY KNOW A LOT MORE ABOUT THIS VIRUS THAN WE DID A FEW MONTHS AGO. PART OF WHAT WE'VE REALIZED IS HOW MUCH MORE EASILY THIS VIRUS SPREADS THAN SOME OF THE OTHER EMERGING CORONAVIRUSES THAT WE'VE SEEN IN THE PAST LIKE THE SARS VIRUS BACK IN 2002-2003 AND THE MRSA VIRUS BACK IN 2012-2013. EACH VIRUS OR THREAT WE ENCOUNTER IS UNIQUE AND IT HAS ITS OWN UNIQUE CHALLENGES, AND THIS NOVEL CORONAVIRUS IS NO DIFFERENT. AND SO I THINK EARLY ON, WHAT YOU SAW AND WHAT PEOPLE IN PUBLIC MAY HAVE HEARD IS US LOOKING AT PAST VIRUSES TO INFORM HOW THIS VIRUS MIGHT BEHAVE, AND OVER THE LAST FEW MONTHS WE'VE LEARNED THAT THERE ARE CERTAINLY SOME SUBSTANTIAL DIFFERENCES, WHICH HAS -- WHICH HAS MADE IT DIFFICULT TO CONTROL THE SPREAD OF THE VIRUS. WE KNOW THIS VIRUS SPREADS VERY EASILY PERSON-TO-PERSON UNLIKE SOME OF THE OTHER PAST CORONAVIRUSES THAT I JUST MENTIONED. WE KNOW THAT THERE IS POTENTIALLY A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF PEOPLE THAT CAN HAVE THIS VIRUS BAND TRANSMITTING IT BEFORE THEY EVEN SHOW SYMPTOMS. THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION HAS ESTIMATED THAT UPWARDS OF 1/3 OF PEOPLE MAY BE ASYMPTOMATIC, AND THAT'S OBVIOUSLY AN ESTIMATE. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE TRUE NUMBER IS BUT THAT HAS GREAT IMPLICATIONS FOR OUR ABILITY TO CONTROL THIS VIRUS AND AS WE'VE LEARNED MORE WE'VE TRIED TO ADAPT OUR STRATEGIES THAT YOU HEARD THE COMMISSIONER JUST TALKING ABOUT, TESTING RECOMMENDATIONS HAVE, IN FACT, CHANGED AS WE'VE LEARNED MORE ABOUT THIS VIRUS AND HOW IT CAN BE SPREAD EASILY BEFORE SOMEONE SHOWS SYMPTOMS AND POTENTIALLY PEOPLE CAN BE SHEDDING THIS VIRUS IN HIGH AMOUNTS BEFORE THEY EVEN HAVE SYMPTOMS. THAT'S INFORMED OUR TESTING STRATEGIES TO BE CERTAIN BUT IT'S STILL, YOU KNOW, THERE IS STILL NO VACCINE, RIGHT? WE'RE HOPEFUL, BUT A VACCINE IS LIKELY MONTHS AWAY. THERE IS STILL NO MEDICATION THAT PEOPLE CAN TAKE TO PREVENT INFECTION LIKE THERE ARE WITH SOME OTHER VIRUSES, SO A LOT OF OUR STRATEGIES, AS WE'VE LEARNED MORE ABOUT THIS VIRUS OVER THE LAST FEW MONTHS HAVE FOCUSED ON TESTING, AS ONE COMPONENT, BUT THERE IS STILL A GREAT NEED FOR PEOPLE TO CONTINUE WITH THE SOCIAL DISTANCING, YOU KNOW, WEARING CLOTH FACE COVERINGS WHEN IN PUBLIC SETTINGS. WHERE SOCIAL DISTANCING MAY BE DIFFICULT. THESE ARE PART OF THE KEY STRATEGIES FOR CONTROLLING THIS VIRUS GIVEN WHAT WE FOUND OUT AND UNDERSTOOD ABOUT THE VIRUS OVER THE LAST FEW MONTHS. >> THANKS. >> WE HAVE ONE MORE? SURE. >> THE QUESTION COMES FROM THE ROCHESTER POLICE. GO AHEAD WITH YOUR QUESTION. >> OH, THANK YOU. CAN YOU HEAR ME OKAY? >> WECAN, HARRISON. >> ALL RIGHT. COMMISSIONER, CAN YOU TELL US WHAT THE AVERAGE PERCENTAGE OF FOLKS TESTING POSITIVE THESE DAYS, FOR THE REGULAR DAILY TESTING, I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY THOUSANDS, WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THEM ARE ASYMPTOMATIC, AND FOR THE GOVERNOR, GOVERNOR, IF YOU WILL ALLOW 40% CAPACITY IN NEW HAMPSHIRE CHURCHES, I'M WONDERING WHY NOT 40% INSIDE RESTAURANTS, THEY WEAR A MASK, OTHER THAN THAT, THEY GET SERVED THEIR FOOD JUST LIKE THEY DO OUTSIDE RIGHT NOW. >> SURE, IF I MAY, I'M GOING TO ANSWER FOR THE COMMISSIONER. I DON'T BELIEVE WE HAVE THE DATA ON THE EXACT PERCENTAGE OF INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE ASYMPTOMATIC VERSUS SYMPTOMATIC IN OUR POSITIVE POPULATION UNFORTUNATELY. IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS, IT'S A BIT GRAY. IF SOMEONE SNEEZED, IS THAT A TRUE SYMPTOM OR NOT? THAT DATA IS VERY HARD TO COME BY BOTH LOCALLY AND NATIONALLY FRANKLINLY IN. TERMS OF THE PERCENT CAPACITY, IN THE CHURCH SITUATION VERSUS OTHER SCENARIOS WE'RE ALLOWING CHURCHES AND PLACES OF WORSHIP TO PROCEED WITH THEIR SERVICES, UP TO 40%. THE QUESTION IS WHY CAN'T WE ALLOW THAT IN RESTAURANTS? HOPE ANY WE'LL BE ABLE TO TAKE THAT STEP. WE'VE TAKEN A FIRST STEP WITH RESTAURANTS WITH OUTDOOR SEATING. HOPE ANY WE'LL BE ABLE TO TAKE ANOTHER STEP LOOKING AT POTENTIALLY INDOOR SEATING WITH SOME RESTRICTIONS IN THE NEAR FUTURE AND SO, YES, WE'RE LOOKING TO TAKE A STEM STEP BUT THEY ARE TWO VERY DIFFERENT THINGS AS WELL. YOU'VE GOT TO BE CAREFUL ASSUME ONE DIRECTLY PERTAINS TO THE OTHER. DOCTOR, IF YOU HAD A PATIENT WHAT CAME TO YOU AND SAID, DR. CHAN, I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO ATTEND ONE OF THESE PROTESTS BUT I'M WORRIED ABOUT MY HEALTH. WHAT WOULD YOU ADVISE THAT PATIENT? >> YEAH, SO THE QUESTION IS ABOUT SOMEONE BEING OUT IN PUBLIC SETTINGS, I THINK, NOT NECESSARILY JUST IF THEY ARE GOING TO BE ATTENDING A PROTEST. REALLY, I THINK THAT QUESTION PERTAINS TO GOING OUT TO A RESTAURANT, GOING OUT TO A BARBERSHOP. THERE ARE CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE AT HIGHER RISK FOR SEVERE ILLNESS, IF THEY BECOME INFECTED WITH COVID-19, RIGHT? AND THIS IS WHERE IT'S IMPORTANT FOR INDIVIDUALS TO BE TALKING WITH THEIR HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS ABOUT WHAT THEIR RISKS ARE BASED ON THEIR OWN INDIVIDUAL HEALTH CONDITIONS. WE STILL RECOMMEND THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE AT HIGHER RISK FOR SEVERE COMPLICATIONS FROM COVID-19 STAY AT HOME AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE AND ONLY GOING OUT FOR THE ESSENTIALS. WHO IS AT HIGHER REST SNOW COVER OLDER ADULTS, PARTICULARLY IF PEOPLE ARE OLDER THAN 60. PEOPLE WITH MULTIPLE MEDICAL PROBLEMS. THE MORE HEALTH PROBLEMS THAT SOMEONE HAS THE MORE SUSCEPTIBLE WE BELIEVE PROBABLY THEY ARE TO COMPLICATIONS FROM COVID-19. CERTAINLY IF SOMEONE'S IMMUNE SYSTEM DOESN'T WORK CORRECTLY THEY ARE AT INCREASED RISK. THOSE INDIVIDUALS REGARDLESS OF WHAT THEY MAY BE CONSIDERING GOING OUT FOR ARE AT INCREASED RISK FOR COVID-19 SO THE RECOMMENDATION IS STILL FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS TO STAY AT HOME AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO HIGHLIGHT, THOUGH, ANYBODY CAN BECOME INFECTED WITH THIS, AND THEN THEY CAN GO ON TO TRANSMIT IT TO SOMEONE ELSE, SO, YOU KNOW, FOR EXAMPLE, KIDS, YOUNGER ADULTS, PEOPLE THAT MAY NOT HAVE CHRONIC MEDICAL CONDITIONS, THEY ARE CERTAINLY AT LOWER RISK FOR SEVERE COMPLICATIONS, BUT RISKS STILL REMAIN FOR THEMSELVES, FOR THEIR OWN PERSONAL HEALTH BUT THEY ALSO CAN POTENTIALLY SERVE AS A ROUTE OF TRANSMITTING IT TO SOMEONE ELSE, AN ELDERLY PARENT, GRANDPARENT, ELDERLY NEIGHBOR, A NEIGHBOR WHO HAS A HEALTH CONDITION THAT YOU'RE NOT AWARE OF WHO MIGHT BE AT INCREASED RISK. SO FOR THAT REASON IT'S IMPORTANT FOR EVERYBODY TO REALLY CONTINUE WITH THE SOCIAL DISTANCING RECOMMENDATIONS. >> THANKS. >> FOR THE RELIEF FUND, WE'VE RECEIVED THE ROUGH NUMBERS, JUST OVER 13,000 APPLICATIONS, THROUGH THE END OF FRIDAY, WHICH IS THE LAST DAY FOR THE PRE-GRANT APPLICATIONS. AND WE'RE KIND OF ASSESSING, YOU KNOW, ONE OF THE THINGS WE'RE LOOKING AT NOW IS SOMETIMES PEOPLE MIGHT HAVE SUBMITTED TWO APPLICATIONS SO WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THE LIST AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE AND RELEASE THE ACTUAL GRANT APPLICATION, FINAL GRANT APPLICATION BACK TO THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO MEET THE QUALIFICATIONS. HOPEFULLY STICHL LATER THIS WEEK, YEAH. I THINK WE' ON A VERY GOOD PATH THERE. >> ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US AGAIN. WE JUST WANT EVERYONE TO BE SAFE. WE ALWAYS END THIS TALKING ABOUT BE SAFE, WHEN YOU'RE OUT IN THE PUBLIC, WE ALWAYS WAN TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO WEAR THEIR MASKS. WE HAVE TO BE COGNIZANT OF WHAT'S HAPPENING NATIONALLY AND IN OUR COMMUNITIES. WE'VE SAID MANY TIMES THIS AFTERNOON THE MESSAGE SURROUNDING THESE PROTESTS IS A POSITIVE ONE. UNFORTUNATELY THAT CAN BE OVERSHADOWED WITH VIOLENCE, AND, YOU KNOW, IF FOLKS ARE THROUGHOUT AND THEY SEE SOMETHING, THERE IS STILL A SEE SOMETHING, SAY SOMETHING ASPECT TO OUR COMMUNITIES. IT'S BEEN A VERY POWERFUL MESSAGE IN A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT SITUATIONS, AND THE SITUATION THAT IS WE'RE EXPERIENCING, THE COUNTRY SAW THIS PAST WEEKEND, AND THAT WE KNOW WE COULD POTENTIALLY FACE, REALLY APPLY. WHETHER IT'S SOMETHING ON SOCIAL MEDIA. WHETHER YOU SEE FOLKS TRYING TO INCITE SOMETHING THAT SHOULDN'T BE THERE, THAT COULD LEAD TO SOMETHING VIOLENT, THERE IS -- YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE ANY HESITATION PICKING UP THE PHONE AND LETTING LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT KNOW THERE IS SOMETHING THROUGHOUT SO WE CAN FOLLOW UP ON IT. WE HAVE A WHOLE TEAM ON IT, STAYING RIGHT ON TOP OF THESE, I, SO AGAIN, UNFORTUNATELY, OUR JOB IS TO PLAN FOR THE WORST, AND THE SPECTRUM OF INCIDENTS THAT COULD HAPPEN SURROUNDING THESE PROTESTS ARE OFTEN IN THE AFTERMATH OF THESE PROTESTS. WE NEED TO BE PREPARED. WE'RE GOING TO BE PREPARED. WE'RE GOING TO BE READY TO MAKE SURE WE'RE PROTECTING OUR COMMUNITIES, HOMES, BUSINESSES, INDIVIDUALS, AND MAKE SURE THAT REGARDLESS OF WHERE IT IS, WHETHER IT'S MANCHESTER OR NASHUA OR ANY TOWN ACROSS THE STATE, WE'RE ALL READY TO STEP UP AND BOY THE SECURITY.

1622652544,2020-06-01 16:27:48,Trump to visit Maine manufacturer of coronavirus testing swabs,https://www.fosters.com/news/20200601/trump-to-visit-maine-manufacturer-of-coronavirus-testing-swabs?rssfeed=true,en,True,,82445,fosters.com,http://www.fosters.com/#spider,"GUILFORD, Maine (AP) — President Donald Trump is paying a visit to Maine on Friday to a manufacturer of specialized swabs used in testing for the coronavirus. Puritan Medical Products, which is one of only two major manufacturers of the swabs, is in the process of opening a second production site with a goal of roughly doubling monthly production from 21.6 million swabs per month to 40 million per month by August or September. The Trump administration is providing $75.5 million through the Defense Production Act to boost production. The Guilford-based company hopes to have the second production facility in Pittsfield running by July 1. Word of the visit came during a discussion between Trump and governors Monday following a weekend of demonstrations, some violent, following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Maine Gov. Janet Mills expressed concerns about ""security problems"" in light of the racial unrest. She asked the president about intelligence on protesters that he said he possessed. About 300 people in Maine's largest city marched on Sunday, blocking traffic and leaving graffiti at the police headquarters. But that was mild in comparison to destruction caused by protests elsewhere around the country. Demonstrators were outraged by video that showed Floyd was pinned to pavement by a police officer who put his knee on the handcuffed black's man neck. He was later pronounced dead at a hospital. Trump urged governors to crack down on protesters: ""You've got to arrest people, you have to track people, you have to put them in jail for 10 years and you'll never see this stuff again.""

AP — Bebeto Matthews MINNEAPOLIS — George Floyd’s brother pleaded for peace in the streets Monday, saying destruction is “not going to bring my brother back at all,” while President Donald Trump berated most of the nation’s governors as “weak” for not cracking down harder on the lawlessness that has convulsed cities from coast to coast. The competing messages — one conciliatory, one bellicose — came as the U.S. braced for another round of violence at a time when the country already is buckling because of the coronavirus outbreak and the Depression-level unemployment it has caused. “We are a country that is scared,” said Sam Page, county executive in St. Louis County, Mo., where the city of Ferguson has been synonymous with the Black Lives Matter movement since the 2014 death of Michael Brown, a black 18-year-old, during a confrontation with a white officer. “We are a country that is angry. And we are a country that is holding out for the promise of justice for all.” In Minneapolis, Floyd’s brother, Terrence, made an emotional plea at the site where Floyd was pinned to the pavement by an officer who put his knee on the handcuffed black man’s neck for nearly nine minutes. “Let’s switch it up, y’all. Let’s switch it up. Do this peacefully, please,” Terrence Floyd said. The crowd chanted, “What’s his name? George Floyd!” and “One down, three to go!” in reference to the four officers involved in Floyd’s arrest. Officer Derek Chauvin has been charged with murder, but protesters are demanding that his colleagues be prosecuted, too. All four were fired. The gathering was part rally and part impromptu eulogy as Floyd urged people to stop the violence and use their power at the ballot box. “If I’m not over here messing up my community, then what are you all doing?” he said. “You all are doing nothing. Because that’s not going to bring my brother back at all.” The country has been beset by angry demonstrations for the past week in some of the most widespread racial unrest in the U.S. since the 1960s. Spurred in part by Floyd’s death, protesters have taken to the streets to decry the killings of black people by police. While most of the demonstrations have been peaceful, others have descended into violence, leaving neighborhoods in shambles, stores ransacked and cars burned, despite curfews around the country and the deployment of thousands of National Guard members in at least 15 states. Meanwhile, an autopsy commissioned for Floyd’s family found that he died of asphyxiation from neck and back compression, the family’s attorneys said. That distinguishes it from the official autopsy, which said he died from the effects of being restrained along with underlying health problems and potential intoxicants in his system. It found nothing “to support a diagnosis of traumatic asphyxia or strangulation.” The second autopsy was done by a doctor who also examined the body of Eric Garner, a New York man who died in an officer’s chokehold six years ago. While police in some places tried to calm tensions by kneeling or marching in solidarity, officers elsewhere were accused of treating protesters with the same kind of heavy-handed tactics that contributed to the unrest in the first place. Cities struggled to keep police in line. In Fort Lauderdale, Fla., an officer was suspended for pushing a kneeling woman to the ground during a protest. In Atlanta, two officers were fired after bashing in the window of a car and using a stun gun on the occupants. In Los Angeles, a police SUV accelerated into several protesters, knocking two people to the ground. In New York, the police commissioner said about six incidents were being investigated by the department’s internal affairs bureau, including a weekend confrontation in Brooklyn in which two police vehicles appeared to plow through a group of protesters. In another incident, an officer pointed a gun at protesters, drawing condemnation from the mayor. “I think some of the actions of the NYPD have exacerbated the anger,” New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said. “There are videos of some NYPD actions that are very disturbing. There are videos of NYPD cars driving into a crowd that are very disturbing. Pulling a mask down off a person to pepper spray them. Throwing a woman to the ground. It’s on video! It’s on video!” New York Mayor Bill de Blasio said he was considering imposing a curfew on the nation’s biggest city after groups of people broke into Chanel, Prada and Rolex boutiques and electronics stores on Sunday night. At the same time, the mayor said the law-breaking in the city of 8.6 million people was being “fomented by a very small number of violent protesters.” Around the country, political leaders girded for the possibility of more of what unfolded over the weekend: protesters hurling rocks and Molotov cocktails at police in Philadelphia, setting a fire near the White House and smashing their way into Los Angeles stores, running off with as much as they could carry. At least 4,400 people have been arrested for offenses such as stealing, blocking highways and breaking curfew, according to a count by The Associated Press. Police officers and National Guard soldiers enforcing a curfew in Louisville, Ky., killed a man early Monday when they returned fire after someone in a large group shot at them, police said. In Indianapolis, two people were reported dead in bursts of downtown violence over the weekend, adding to deaths recorded in Detroit and Minneapolis. Former Vice President Joe Biden, the Democratic presidential candidate, vowed to address institutional racism in his first 100 days in office. He met in person with black leaders in Delaware and also held a virtual meeting with big-city mayors. He said hate emerges “when you have somebody in power who breathes oxygen into the hate.”",0.0

Chris Sununu danced a careful line in response to the national protests following the death of George Floyd, praising peaceful demonstrators but warning against potential violence and looting. At a press conference Monday, Sununu started out his remarks by highlighting the case of Floyd, an African American man whose death at the hands of a white Minneapolis police officer last week unleashed anger and protests in dozens of American cities over the weekend. “We all know that racism has no home here, and will not be tolerated anywhere in New Hampshire, and neither does violence and looting or rioting, by any stretch of the imagination,” he said. On Saturday, Sununu gave his blessing to a protest along Manchester’s Elm Street, calling organizers ahead of time to underscore that his office stood with them. That protest did not result in property damages or police clashes seen in other cities, though two counter-protesters were arrested after pointing handguns at the crowd. Sununu said the death of Floyd in Minneapolis, which led to the arrest of officer Derek Chauvin on third-degree murder charges, should prompt reform and “real action items” across the country. But he also warned that law enforcement would take action against demonstrators if violence emerged. “It has been very peaceful to date, but we know that at any moment, there’s no state, there’s no community that could potentially be immune from the potential of the violence and the rioting that we have seen unfortunately play out in other parts of the country,” he said. The governor distanced himself from rhetoric by President Donald Trump, who urged governors Monday to “dominate” protesters with law enforcement. “You have to dominate, if you don’t dominate you’re wasting your time,” Trump said, according to an audio version of the call first reported by CBS. “They’re going to run over you.” Those comments spurred backlash from activists, who have pointed to documented cases of police using force against unarmed protesters across the country this weekend. Earlier Monday Dan Feltes, a Democratic candidate for governor, had decried the comments, calling on Sununu, a Republican, to “finally speak out against Donald Trump’s divisive and violent rhetoric,” pointing to Monday’s comments and earlier ones from the president calling some of the protesters “thugs.” Sununu said he disagreed with the president’s advice. “Speaking for myself, no. I don’t think that anyone needs to be dominated,” Sununu said. But he argued that law enforcement should be deployed if violence emerged in the Granite State, and said he has been in contact with state police, local police departments, and the National Guard, which is currently assisting in the state’s COVID-19 response. “The good news is the men and women of the National Guard are incredibly flexible. And the fact that they can transition from whether it’s working at the food bank or working in a testing center (to) kind of mobilizing themselves on the frontline of a riot or anything of that nature, they can do it,” he said. “And they can do it very quickly.” Sununu also sought to draw a distinction between the protests happening in response to Floyd’s death – which are expected to continue through the week – and the ones that have happened in recent weeks against Sununu’s stay-at-home order, which has shuttered many businesses in response to the spread of COVID-19. The two causes are not on the same level, Sununu argued, praising protesters during the Floyd march for wearing face masks, which have often been absent from the “re-open New Hampshire” rallies. “Those that want to compare social injustices and the issue surrounding the murder of George Floyd, to the effectiveness of a stay at home or in social gatherings are completely missing the point,” Sununu said.

Join the conversation. It was a turbulent weekend across the country. Protests and demonstrations that began in Minneapolis following the death of George Floyd at the hands of police last week, have carried on in dozens of other U.S. cities. Some of the organized demonstrations were peaceful, others turned violent and destructive, with cars and buildings burned, vandalism and widespread looting reported and police and protestors injured as they clashed. More than five decades after the civil rights movement protests led by the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., the George Floyd rallies show the scars of social injustice, inequality and racism remain in America. Could these current-day demonstrations lead to policy shifts and systemic change as the civil rights protests of the 1960s did? Jill Savitt, the executive director of the National Center for Civil and Human Rights, thinks they could. “You hate that you need tragedies like this for change, but history tells us that’s what happens,” Savitt said. “We’re having a societal shake of the lapels.” In the wake of George Floyd’s death and amid so much national unrest, what do you think should be done to help the country heal?

1622697289,2020-06-01 18:05:46,'Stand together&rsquo;: Black Lives Matter protest at Hampton Beach,https://www.seacoastonline.com/news/20200601/stand-togetherrsquo-black-lives-matter-protest-at-hampton-beach?rssfeed=true,en,False,,54318,seacoastonline.com,http://www.seacoastonline.com/#spider,"HAMPTON - When Jacob Chiza watched the video showing the death of George Floyd at the hands of a white police officer in Minneapolis on TV, he thought to himself, “enough is enough.” “I said, ‘I need to step up,’” said Chiza, 22, of Manchester. “I need to make change. They need to hear us because enough is enough because it just keeps happening over and over again.” Chiza joined nearly 200 people Monday at the Seashell Stage at Hampton Beach for a Black Lives Matter protest of the killing of Floyd. He also attended similar protests in Manchester and in Boston. Attendees at Hampton Beach held up signs reading “End Police Brutality,” “Justice for Floyd,” “Outraged” and “My Life Matters.” They stood silently with one hand in the air as the words of Martin Luther King Jr. played on a loudspeaker. The speech played was King’s “The Three Evils of Society,” which he gave at the height of the civil rights movement. Gerald Kimani, of Haverhill, Massachusetts, held up a sign that stated “I am not a threat. You can kill some of us, but you can’t kill all of us.“ “It’s getting old and we all need to stand together,” said Kimani, on what brought him out. “It’s not about black people. It’s not about white people. It’s about all of us. It’s about all of us versus the racists.” Portsmouth resident Keondray Lucas said he felt compelled to come out and protest the “injustices in our law system. ... That’s not saying all cops are bad. I don’t believe that at all. I believe that people are confused and scared and they want justice. They want peace. They want to go outside without fearing the people who are supposed to be there to protect us.” After the rally, attendees spoke out, urging those in attendance to keep making their voices heard. They also chanted “I can’t breathe, I can’t breathe,” words uttered by Floyd as an officer held him down with a knee over his neck. One attendee asked for the police officers in attendance to take a knee with them in solidarity. Hampton police Lt. Alex Reno and Seabrook Police Deputy Chief Kevin Gelineau joined them. “The lieutenant and I thought it was the right move,” Gelineau said. “We are supportive of their message. We understand and we are as devastated as they are. We don’t agree with what happened. Just because I wear a badge, doesn’t mean every decision a police officer makes in the country is supported by me simply because we are on the same job. And so we felt it was right to show them that we recognize why they are here and we are glad they were able to have a peaceful protest."" Prior to the rally, Reno stopped to talk to protesters individually. “We were just letting them know that we know why they are here and that nothing makes a good cop more angry than bad cops,” Reno said. Sununu weighs in Republican New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu said Monday his office will continue to monitor and work with groups protesting the death of George Floyd while also preparing for potential violence. ""The important conversation -- we just want to make sure it does continue, a constructive one, one of positivity. The message does have to be heard, but we're not going to condone or accept violence by any individuals,"" Sununu said.

They need to hear us because enough is enough because it just keeps happening over and over again.” Chiza joined nearly 200 people Monday at the Seashell Stage at Hampton Beach for a Black Lives Matter protest of the killing of Floyd. He also attended similar protests in Manchester and in Boston. Attendees at Hampton Beach held up signs reading “End Police Brutality,” “Justice for Floyd,” “Outraged” and “My Life Matters.” They stood silently with one hand in the air as the words of Martin Luther King Jr. played on a loudspeaker. The speech played was King’s “The Three Evils of Society,” which he gave at the height of the civil rights movement. Gerald Kimani, of Haverhill, Massachusetts, held up a sign that stated “I am not a threat. You can kill some of us, but you can’t kill all of us.“ “It’s getting old and we all need to stand together,” said Kimani, on what brought him out. “It’s not about black people. It’s not about white people. It’s about all of us. It’s about all of us versus the racists.” Portsmouth resident Keondray Lucas said he felt compelled to come out and protest the “injustices in our law system. ... That’s not saying all cops are bad. I don’t believe that at all. I believe that people are confused and scared and they want justice. They want peace. They want to go outside without fearing the people who are supposed to be there to protect us.” After the rally, attendees spoke out, urging those in attendance to keep making their voices heard. They also chanted “I can’t breathe, I can’t breathe,” words uttered by Floyd as an officer held him down with a knee over his neck. One attendee asked for the police officers in attendance to take a knee with them in solidarity. Hampton police Lt. Alex Reno and Seabrook Police Deputy Chief Kevin Gelineau joined them. “The lieutenant and I thought it was the right move,” Gelineau said. “We are supportive of their message. We understand and we are as devastated as they are. We don’t agree with what happened. Just because I wear a badge, doesn’t mean every decision a police officer makes in the country is supported by me simply because we are on the same job. And so we felt it was right to show them that we recognize why they are here and we are glad they were able to have a peaceful protest."" Prior to the rally, Reno stopped to talk to protesters individually. “We were just letting them know that we know why they are here and that nothing makes a good cop more angry than bad cops,” Reno said.

Those sparks have landed in a tinderbox assembled over decades of economic inequality, now made worse by the coronavirus pandemic. Minneapolis police officers initially confronted the man — George Floyd — on suspicion that he'd used a counterfeit $20 bill to buy cigarettes. The viral video of what followed captured an individual tragedy. But it's set against a backdrop of poverty and discrimination that have long colored relations between law enforcement and the African American community. African Americans are worse off than whites by almost every economic measure. And that divide has only deepened during the pandemic that's sent the country into its worst economic downturn in generations. A survey by the Federal Reserve last year found that even in good times, African Americans are less able to pay their monthly bills than whites or Latinos. That's hardly surprising, since median income among African Americans is 41% lower than that of non-Hispanic whites. Blacks are also 40% less likely to own their homes than whites — depriving many African American families of an opportunity to build wealth. The gap in homeownership is particularly stark in Minneapolis. A study by Zillow, the online real estate company, found black homeownership in the city lags more than 50 percentage points below the white rate. ""It tells us that there's racism baked in to the housing market,"" said Andre Perry, a fellow at the Brookings Institution and author of Know Your Price: Valuing Black Lives and Property in America's Black Cities. Income disparity, segregation, and racial redlining have all contributed to low national levels of homeownership among African Americans. Although blacks made housing gains in the 1990s and early 2000s, that was reversed by the subprime mortgage crisis, which led to a wave of foreclosures. Before the pandemic struck, African Americans were enjoying a strong job market. The black unemployment rate in February was 5.8% — near a 50-year low, though still higher than the white rate. Since then, unemployment for all racial groups has soared to double-digits. But the black-white gap has not noticeably worsened. Loading... African Americans who are working, however, are more likely to hold jobs that put them at risk of infection. A survey by the Labor Department found that in 2018, less than 20% of African Americans held jobs they could do from home, compared to about 30% of whites. Higher risk of on-the-job exposure to the coronavirus is compounded by African Americans' higher rates of diabetes, heart disease and other conditions that are thought to contribute to more severe cases of COVID-19. ""There have been epidemics in the black community that have existed for generations before COVID,"" Perry said. ""COVID accentuated and exposed those epidemics."" Just as the pandemic puts unequal health outcomes under a microscope, the video of George Floyd's last moments illuminates the frustration brought about by generations of economic hardship. ""That action really symbolized the knee on the neck of black homeowners and renters,"" Perry said. ""It represents the employers who don't provide the kind of benefits and wages that will lift African American communities."" He suggested the demonstrations taking place across the country, five months before a national election, provide an opportunity for candidates to spell out how they would deal with these challenges. ""If we don't address the structural inequality,"" Perry said, ""we'll be right back in the same place when the next inevitable crisis hits.""  Copyright 2020 NPR.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Today I have strongly recommended to every governor to deploy the National Guard in sufficient numbers, that we dominate the streets. CHANG: And as President Trump made his remarks to the nation, protesters chanted outside the White House. Immediately after, the president exited the White House and walked a brief distance to St. John's Church. The historic church was damaged by a fire during the recent protests. NPR's Tim Mak joins us now from Washington with more. Hi, Tim. TIM MAK, BYLINE: Hey there. CHANG: So what are you seeing right now at the moment? MAK: So I'm at the corner of Connecticut and I Street NW, not very far from the White House. And we just saw a few dozen protesters kind of get enveloped by lines of police on either side of us. It looks like they are making arrests right now. They did let the press kind of squeeze out through an exit, but they checked all badges. And basically, anyone who didn't have a press badge at that time, it looks like, is being detained. We've now been pushed about a block away from that now. CHANG: Wow, OK. Can you describe the moment that we just mentioned, when the president left the White House on foot to visit the damaged church. Tell us what happened exactly there. MAK: Well, authorities very quickly cleared protesters from Lafayette Park in order for the president to make that short walk from the White House over there. And once there, he stood holding a Bible. The president invited other officials, including the attorney general and the White House press secretary, to join him. It's not a very large distance between those two venues. That's St. John's Church. I should mention this is a church of significant historical importance and has been visited by every president since James Madison. Now, of course, Lafayette Park is the area right in front of the White House, where a lot of demonstrators have gathered in recent days. CHANG: OK. And I know that you have been out there for a while. You have been talking to protesters. What kind of things are you hearing in reaction to the president's remarks tonight? MAK: Well, I'm not sure a lot of the people who have been out here were listening to the president's remarks in real time. CHANG: Interesting. MAK: There's a - definitely a disconnect between the people who are here demonstrating today and what the president is trying to convey from the White House, from the Rose Garden and so forth. We spoke to Joseph Varrentas (ph). He's a 28-year-old who lives here in Washington, D.C. He came down, and he said that he was protesting against violence, against some of the actions of law enforcement in recent days. We saw bruises and cuts on his arms and on his forearm. And we also observed over the course of the last hour and a half or so, you know, police pushing back against protesters. We saw some minor injuries. We saw law enforcement using riot shields and using their batons in kind of rhythmic fashion to push demonstrators back away from the White House. CHANG: Well, there is now a local curfew in effect in Washington, D.C., as of 7 p.m. Eastern. It is now 8 p.m. where you are. Does it look like that curfew is going to be enforced? Does it look like that people are going to respect it? What's your sense at this moment? MAK: When we first were walking around at around 7 o'clock, when the curfew began to take effect, we did see people leaving. But it appears now that the people who are here are the people who are willing and interested in staying and not adhering to that curfew. We are not seeing - we don't know if the curfew is being enforced or whether other issues are being enforced.

They need to hear us because enough is enough because it just keeps happening over and over again.” Chiza joined nearly 200 people Monday at the Seashell Stage at Hampton Beach for a Black Lives Matter protest of the killing of Floyd. He also attended similar protests in Manchester and in Boston. Attendees at Hampton Beach held up signs reading “End Police Brutality,” “Justice for Floyd,” “Outraged” and “My Life Matters.” They stood silently with one hand in the air as the words of Martin Luther King Jr. played on a loudspeaker. The speech played was King’s “The Three Evils of Society,” which he gave at the height of the civil rights movement. Gerald Kimani, of Haverhill, Massachusetts, held up a sign that stated “I am not a threat. You can kill some of us, but you can’t kill all of us.“ “It’s getting old and we all need to stand together,” said Kimani, on what brought him out. “It’s not about black people. It’s not about white people. It’s about all of us. It’s about all of us versus the racists.” Portsmouth resident Keondray Lucas said he felt compelled to come out and protest the “injustices in our law system. ... That’s not saying all cops are bad. I don’t believe that at all. I believe that people are confused and scared and they want justice. They want peace. They want to go outside without fearing the people who are supposed to be there to protect us.” After the rally, attendees spoke out, urging those in attendance to keep making their voices heard. They also chanted “I can’t breathe, I can’t breathe,” words uttered by Floyd as an officer held him down with a knee over his neck. One attendee asked for the police officers in attendance to take a knee with them in solidarity. Hampton police Lt. Alex Reno and Seabrook Police Deputy Chief Kevin Gelineau joined them. “The lieutenant and I thought it was the right move,” Gelineau said. “We are supportive of their message. We understand and we are as devastated as they are. We don’t agree with what happened. Just because I wear a badge, doesn’t mean every decision a police officer makes in the country is supported by me simply because we are on the same job. And so we felt it was right to show them that we recognize why they are here and we are glad they were able to have a peaceful protest."" Prior to the rally, Reno stopped to talk to protesters individually. “We were just letting them know that we know why they are here and that nothing makes a good cop more angry than bad cops,” Reno said. Sununu weighs in Republican New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu said Monday his office will continue to monitor and work with groups protesting the death of George Floyd while also preparing for potential violence. ""The important conversation -- we just want to make sure it does continue, a constructive one, one of positivity. The message does have to be heard, but we're not going to condone or accept violence by any individuals,"" Sununu said. ""I'm here to assure the people of New Hampshire that we're putting in every effort to make sure we're prepared for whatever scenarios come."" The protest at Hampton Beach Monday followed a call in which President Donald Trump berated most of the nation's governors as ""weak"" for not cracking down harder on protesters. Asked to respond, Sununu said he is focused more on learning from governors and mayors around the country than on Trump's comments. ""The president's rhetoric is the president's rhetoric,"" he said. As for Trump's comments urging local officials to ""dominate"" the streets, Sununu said, ""No, I don't think anyone needs to be dominated."" ""If anything, here in New Hampshire we've shown working together in a very constructive and peaceful way is clearly a pathway to be successful,"" he said. Another reporter asked Sununu whether he'd encourage other groups to violate the state's stay-at-home order and prohibition on large gatherings. ""Those that want to compare social injustices and issues surrounding the murder of George Floyd to the effectiveness of a stay-at-home order and social gatherings are completely missing the point,"" he said. ""That event was going to happen, and frankly, it should happen."" Material from Associated Press writer Holly Ramer is included in this report.",0.0

1622781369,2020-06-01 21:45:20,Scott says Minn. officers should be prosecuted; region’s Republican governors chafe at Trump’s comments,https://www.vnews.com/Scott-calls-for-prosecution-of-officers-involved-in-George-Floyd-killing-34568490,en,False,,24712,vnews.com,http://www.vnews.com,"MONTPELIER — Gov. Phil Scott said on Monday that the four Minneapolis police officers involved in the killing of George Floyd should be prosecuted, as he also called for protesters in Vermont to keep the peace, and announced the launch of a racial equity task force to explore policies to combat systemic racism. Hundreds of protesters turned out in Burlington and Montpelier on Saturday as part of nationwide protests and riots sparked by the killing of Floyd. Scott said the anger was justified, and noted that he had joined the Vermont State Police in condemning the police actions. “Mr. Floyd’s death, under their watch, under an officer’s knee, is barbaric and totally inexcusable,” Scott said in remarks at the start of his Monday press conference. “It’s my belief they should all be charged and tried for murder and held fully accountable,” Scott said, “both the three officers who used force (and) the officer who stood by and allowed it to occur. “In the greatest country in the world,” Scott continued, “no one should stand for this. No one should make excuses for this. And no one should ignore this.” The governor noted that many Vermonters are joining in the calls for justice. “And I respect those who are doing so,” he said. “I only ask that you do so peacefully and safely, especially considering the public health crisis we’re facing.” Health Commissioner Mark Levine briefly noted his concern over the size of the protests in Vermont — the governor is increasing the allowable crowd size from 10 to 25 on Monday — while also noting that many participants wore face masks. Vermont’s public safety commissioner, Michael Schirling, said the incident in Minneapolis “looks like something that if it were happening here we would be investigating and referring for prosecution.” He added that such action has no place in Vermont’s police force. “If you’re in this job for any other reason than community service with empathy and to provide a requisite level of protection to those who need it, you should be looking elsewhere,” he said. “We’re past the point where this is something we should be discussing.” Scott was asked about President Donald Trump’s remarks on Monday — after fires burned outside the White House Sunday night — in which he told governors they should “dominate” protesters, adding they would look like “jerks” if rioters were not arrested and jailed “for long periods of time.” “I don’t think the president’s words are reflective of reality,” Scott said. “I believe that we should be leading by example. And, obviously, there are some situations where you have to use more force. But this wasn’t one of them for us here over the weekend.” Asked if he thought Trump should address the nation, Scott said: “Well, maybe not with that attitude.” In New Hampshire, Gov. Chris Sununu, also a Republican, told reporters he is committed to learning from Floyd’s death. “The important conversation — we just want to make sure it does continue, a constructive one, one of positivity. The message does have to be heard, but we’re not going to condone or accept violence by any individuals,” Sununu said. “I’m here to assure the people of New Hampshire that we’re putting in every effort to make sure we’re prepared for whatever scenarios come.” Sununu said he called protesters ahead of a peaceful march in Manchester on Saturday to tell them he supported their message. On Monday, about 60 people gathered at Hampton Beach for another protest, including several officers who joined in by taking a knee. Participants held signs that read “White Silence is Violence” and “We stand with black lives.” Asked to respond to Trump’s comments, Sununu said he is focused more on learning from governors and mayors around the country than on Trump’s comments. “The president’s rhetoric is the president’s rhetoric,” he said. As for Trump’s comments urging local officials to “dominate” the streets, Sununu said, “No, I don’t think anyone needs to be dominated.” “If anything, here in New Hampshire we’ve shown working together in a very constructive and peaceful way is clearly a pathway to be success,” he said. In Massachusetts, Gov. Charlie Baker, also a Republican, reacted strongly to Trump’s comments, saying they were unneeded. “I know I should be surprised when I hear incendiary words like this from him, but I’m not,” Baker said during a news conference on Monday, according to The Boston Globe. “At so many times during these last several weeks, when the country needed compassion and leadership the most, it simply was nowhere to be found. Instead, we got bitterness, combativeness, and self-interest. That’s not what we need in Boston, it’s not what we need right now in Massachusetts, and it’s definitely not what we need across this great country of ours either.” Material from the Associated Press was used in this report.",0.0

Amid racial unrest across the nation, President Donald Trump on Monday declared himself ""the president of law and order"" and threatened to deploy the United States military to American cities to quell a rise of violent protests. As Trump spoke, an incredible TV split screen developed around the White House. While he addressed the nation in the White House's idyllic Rose Garden, a series of military vehicles rolled out front on Pennsylvania Avenue and military police and law enforcement clashed with protesters at Lafayette Park. Those peaceful demonstrators were cleared so Trump could walk across the park to St. John's Episcopal Church, known as ""The Church of the Presidents,"" which suffered fire damage in a protest this week. Holding a Bible, he then stood with several of his Cabinet members as the cameras clicked. ""We have the greatest country in the world,"" Trump declared. ""We're going to keep it safe."" Trump said he would mobilize ""thousands and thousands"" of soldiers to keep the peace if governors did not use the National Guard to shut down the protests. Loud tear gas explosions could be heard as authorities moved what appeared to be peaceful protests in the park. The escalation came just after Attorney General William Barr came to the park to to survey the demonstrators. According to senior defense officials, between 600 and 800 National Guard members from five states were being sent to Washington to provide assistance. Those troops were either already on the ground or will arrive by midnight. Under the Civil War-era Posse Comitatus Act, federal troops are prohibited from performing domestic law enforcement actions such as making arrests, seizing property or searching people. In extreme cases, however, the president can invoke the Insurrection Act, also from the Civil War, which allows the use of active-duty or National Guard troops for law enforcement.

AP's original story is below. —————————————— President Donald Trump on Monday derided many governors as ""weak"" and demanded tougher crackdowns on burning and stealing among some demonstrations in the aftermath of violent protests in dozens of American cities. Trump spoke to governors on a video teleconference that also included law enforcement and national security officials, telling the state leaders they ""have to get much tougher."" ""Most of you are weak,"" Trump said. ""You have to arrest people."" The days of protests were triggered by the death of George Floyd, a black man who died when a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee into Floyd's neck for several minutes even after he stopped moving and pleading for air. The demonstrations turned violent in several cities, with people trashing stores, smashing and burning police cars and igniting fires in historic Lafayette Park across from the White House. Accused by critics of doing too little to defuse the crisis, Trump was to address the nation early Monday evening. The president urged the governors to deploy the National Guard, which he credited for helping calm the situation Sunday night in Minneapolis. He demanded that similarly tough measures be taken in cities that also experienced violence, including New York, Philadelphia and Los Angeles. ""You've got to arrest people, you have to track people, you have to put them in jail for 10 years and you'll never see this stuff again,"" said Trump. ""We're doing it in Washington, D.C. We're going to do something that people haven't seen before."" The president told the governors they were making themselves ""look like fools"" for not calling up more of the National Guard as a show for force on city streets. Attorney General Bill Barr, who was also on the call, told governors that a joint terrorist task force would be used to track agitators and urged local officials to ""dominate"" the streets and control, not react to crowds. He urged the governors to ""go after troublemakers."" Trump's angry exhortations at the nation's governors came after a Sunday night of escalating violence, images of fires and looting and clashes with police filling the nation's airwaves and overshadowing the largely peaceful protests. The protests had grown so heated Friday night that the Secret Service rushed the president to an underground bunker previously used during terrorist attacks. On Monday, Trump also spoke of trying to criminalize flag-burning. The Supreme Court has conservative new members since it last ruled on that issue, and Trump said that ""I think it's time to review that again."" He continued his effort to project strength, using inflammatory tweets and delivering partisan attacks. As cities have burned night after night and images of violence have dominated television coverage, Trump's advisers have discussed the prospect of an Oval Office address in an attempt to ease tensions. The notion was quickly scrapped for lack of policy proposals and the president's own seeming disinterest in delivering a message of unity. Trump did not appear in public on Sunday and was not scheduled to on Monday either. The demonstrations in Washington appeared to catch officers by surprise. They sparked one of the highest alerts at the White House complex since the Sept. 11 attacks in 2001. Trump has told advisers he worries about his safety, while both privately and publicly praising the work of the Secret Service. Demonstrators returned Sunday afternoon, facing off against police at Lafayette Park into the evening. Trump retweeted a message from a conservative commentator encouraging authorities to respond with greater force. ""This isn't going to stop until the good guys are willing to use overwhelming force against the bad guys,"" Buck Sexton wrote in a message amplified by the president. In recent days security at the White House has been reinforced by the National Guard and additional personnel from the Secret Service and the U.S. Park Police. The Justice Department deployed members of the U.S. Marshals Service and agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration to supplement National Guard troops outside the White House, according to a senior Justice Department official.

Trump's Rose Garden remarks came as just across the street, law enforcement officers deployed tear gas and shot rubber bullets to forcefully disperse peaceful protesters. Washington, D.C., had set a curfew Monday of 7 p.m. ET. The protesters were removed from the Lafayette Square area across from the White House, apparently to clear the way for the president to walk to St. John's Church, where he posed briefly for photographers, holding a Bible. Parts of the church compound were damaged by rioters on Sunday night. In a statement, Judd Deere, the White House's deputy press secretary, said: ""The perimeter was expanded to help enforce the 7 p.m. curfew in the same area where rioters attempted to burn down one of our nation's most historic churches the night before. Protesters were given three warnings by the U.S. Park Police."" Trump's remarks, which lasted less than seven minutes, came after days of protests in dozens of cities across the U.S. following the death of George Floyd, a black man who died in police custody in Minneapolis a week ago. During the remarks, Trump declared himself ""a law-and-order president"" and ""ally of all peaceful protesters,"" but he called violent unrest that has accompanied many demonstrations ""acts of domestic terror."" ""These are not acts of peaceful protests. These are acts of domestic terror. The destruction of innocent life, and the spilling of innocent blood, is an offense to humanity and a crime against God,"" Trump said. He added: ""Our country always wins. That is why I am taking immediate presidential action to stop the violence."" Trump said he had mobilized ""thousands and thousands"" of ""heavily armed"" military personnel to put an end to the protests, which were born from criticisms of excessive force by law enforcement. It was not immediately clear, however, what precise changes might be in store for the personnel who have been responding to the demonstrations across the country. The Justice Department said in a statement that beginning Monday night, it had deployed all of its law enforcement components and is coordinating with the Department of Defense, the Department of Homeland Security and local authorities to ""maximize federal security presence throughout the District [of Columbia]."" Threatening state governors who have declined to deploy the National Guard, Trump said he would dispatch the U.S. military to ""quickly solve the problem for them."" After the stop at St. John's Church, Trump and a retinue of advisers and staffers then returned to the secure enclave within the White House complex. Nation in crisis Protests, which have at times broken out into violence and looting, continued from the weekend into Monday, following the video-recorded death of Floyd, who died after a white officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes. Protesters — many of whom have worn masks because of the coronavirus pandemic — have demanded that the officers involved be held accountable for Floyd's death. Derek Chauvin, the officer who knelt on Floyd's neck, has been arrested and charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Three other officers who were involved in the incident have been fired but have not been charged. Several major cities, including Washington, D.C., were placed under curfews following the unrest. Trump's walk to the nearby church, which he does not typically visit, technically violated the District of Columbia's Monday curfew for a little time. The National Guard has been deployed in many states, and the president on Monday called for governors to ""dominate"" in their states to put an end to the protests. His remarks Monday stand in stark contrast to the position he took toward heavily armed majority-white protesters last month, who stormed the Michigan statehouse in defiance of stay-at-home orders to demand a reopening of the state economy amid the coronavirus pandemic. Trump described those protesters as ""very good people"" and called on the governor to ""give a little"" to appease them. The protests against police violence come against the backdrop of the coronavirus pandemic, which has caused more than 100,000 deaths in the U.S., with black Americans disproportionately affected.

My fellow Americans, my first and highest duty as president, is to defend our great country and the American people. I sworn oath to uphold the laws of our nation, and that is exactly what I will do. All Americans were rightly sickened and revolted by the brutal death of George Floyd. My administration is fully committed that for George and his family justice will be served. He will not have died in vain, but we cannot allow the righteous cries and peaceful protesters to be drown out by an angry mob. The biggest victims off the rioting are peace loving citizens in our poorest communities. And is there President? I will fight to keep them safe. I will fight to protect you. I am your president of Law and Order and an ally of all peaceful protesters. But in recent days, our nation has been gripped by professional anarchists, violent mobs, arsonists, looters, criminals, riders, antifa and others. A number of state and local governments have failed to take necessary action to safeguard their residents. Innocent people have been savagely beaten, like the young man in Dallas, Texas, who was left dying on the street or the woman in upstate New York viciously attacked by dangerous thugs. Small business owners have seen their dreams utterly destroyed. New York's finest have been hit in the face with bricks. Brave nurses who have battled the virus are afraid to leave their homes. A police precinct has been overrun. Here in the nation's capital, the Lincoln Memorial and the World War Two Memorial has been vandalized. One of our most historic churches was set ablaze. A federal officer in California, an African American enforcement hero, was shot and killed. These air not acts of peaceful protests. These are acts of domestic terror. The destruction of innocent life and the spilling of innocent blood is an offense to humanity and a crime against God. America needs creation, not destruction. Cooperation, not contempt. Security, not anarchy. Healing, not hatred, justice, not chaos. This is our mission, and we will succeed 100%. We will succeed. Our country always wins. That is why I am taking immediate presidential action to stop the violence and restore security and safety in America. I am mobilizing all available Federal resource is civilian and military to stop the rioting and looting to end the destruction and arson and to protect the rights of law abiding Americans, including your Second Amendment rights. Therefore, the following measures air going into effect immediately. First, we are ending the riots and lawlessness that has spread throughout our country. We will end it now. Today. I have strongly recommended to every governor to deploy the National Guard insufficient numbers that we dominate the streets. Mayors and governors must establish an overwhelming law enforcement presence until the violence has been quelled. If a city or state refuses to take the actions that are necessary to defend the life and property of their residents, then I will deploy the United States military and quickly solve the problem for them. I am also taking swift and decisive action to protect our great capital, Washington, D. C. What happened in the city last night was a total disgrace. As we speak, I am dispatching thousands and thousands of heavily armed soldiers, military personnel and law enforcement offices to stop the rioting, looting, vandalism, assaults and the wanton destruction of property. We're putting everybody on warning are seven oclock curfew will be strictly enforced. Those who threaten innocent life and property will be arrested detained and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. I want the organizer's of this terror to be unnoticed, that you will face severe criminal penalties and lengthy sentences in jail. This includes Antifa and others who are leading instigators of this violence. One law and order and that is what it is. One law. We have one beautiful law and once that is restored and fully restored, we will help you. We will help your business and we will help your family. America is founded upon the rule of law. It is the foundation of our prosperity, our freedom and our very way of life. But where there is no law, there is no opportunity where there is no justice, there is no liberty. Where there is no safety, there is no future. We must never given to anger or hatred. If malice or violence reigns that none of us is free. I take these actions today with firm resolve and with a true and passionate love for our country. By far our greatest days. Lie ahead. Thank you very much. And now I'm going to pay my respects to a very, very special place. Thank you very much. Advertisement GOP senators critical of President Trump's response to unrest following Floyd's death Share Shares Copy Link Copy Video above: President Trump vows to deploy U.S. military if states can't control violent protestsTop GOP senators are calling on President Donald Trump to take a far more compassionate approach amid the deep unrest following the death of George Floyd in Minnesota, raising concerns that the president's handling of the crisis so far threatens to divide a badly bruised nation further.""I think the country is definitely looking for healing and for calm, and I think that's the tone the president needs to project when talking about what is happening around the country,"" Senate Majority Whip John Thune, a Republican from South Dakota, told CNN. ""I think he needs to strike a tone that fits the level of frustration country's experiencing right now, and I hope in the future, he'll do that.""Thune added that Trump's tweets about the situation have been ""not helpful.""Sen. John Cornyn, also a member of Senate GOP leadership, told CNN that ""I think it's important"" for Trump to offer more of a unifying message in the midst of the deep unrest across the county.""I presume at some point he will address the nation,"" said Cornyn of Texas. ""If I were advising him I would say we need it sooner rather than later.""At a time when Trump could be consoling the nation, Republicans — who rarely break from Trump — are voicing their disapproval that the president has offered little in the way of condolences and instead taken to Twitter to incite divisions and cast blame.""Some of his tweets have not been helpful,"" Sen. Pat Toomey, a Republican from Pennsylvania, said at a news conference Monday. ""It would be helpful if he would change the tone of his message.""The message from his own party comes as protests have grown and spread throughout the country from Los Angeles to Washington.""We are obviously in a divisive situation right now that is escalating. ... He needs to make more unifying comments,"" said Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, a Republican from West Virginia.Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, speaking on the Senate floor, called on Trump ""to help heal the racial division.""""The president should help to heal the racial divisions in this country,"" Collins said. ""It is at times like this that a president needs to speak to the nation, to pledge to right wrongs and to calm inflamed passions.""Asked later if she thinks the president needs to offer a unifying message, Collins said: ""I do.""Sen. Cory Gardner, who like Collins is facing reelection next year, didn't criticize Trump directly but added: ""We all have to do better every day — we have to.""On Friday, the president's handling of the situation came under more scrutiny after he tweeted, ""When the looting starts, the shooting starts,"" a phrase that originated from controversial Miami police chief Walter Headley at the height of the civil rights movement. Headley, who defended practices like using police dogs and force, said at news conference ""We don't mind being accused of police brutality,"" according to an article from the period in The New York Times.""Those are not constructive tweets without any question,"" Sen. Tim Scott, the only black Republican in the U.S. Senate, told Fox on Sunday. ""I will say this, I spoke with the president (Saturday) morning, and he and I had a good conversation about the next steps. I told him, what I am going to tell you. I told him 'Mr. President, it helps us when you focus on the death, the unjustified in my opinion, the criminal death of George Floyd.'""On Monday during a private call with governors, the president continued to blast others for what has unfolded, accusing some states of being weak and arguing that law enforcement needed to ""dominate"" protestors in order to contain the demonstrations in cities across the country.""You have to dominate or you'll look like a bunch of jerks, you have to arrest and try people,"" the president told the governors in a call from the basement White House Situation Room, according to an audio recording of the call obtained by CNN.Majority Leader Mitch McConnell wouldn't answer questions Monday about whether he believed Trump had struck the appropriate tone in his handling of the unrest. Others also declined to comment about Trump's tweets, including Sen. David Perdue of Georgia, who faces voters in the fall.""Well, obviously this is an evolving situation — I think this is a difficult position the president is in,"" said Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida when asked if Trump should shift his tone to emphasize unity. On Monday, McConnell demonstrated a starkly different tone from the president from the floor of the Senate.""In no world, whatsoever, should arresting a man for an alleged minor infraction involve a police officer putting his knee on a man's neck for nine minutes while he cries out 'I can't breathe' and then goes silent,"" McConnell said. ""To me, to a great many of my fellow Kentuckians and to many outraged Americans, these disturbing events do not look like three isolated incidents, they look more like the latest chapter in our national struggle to make equal justice and equal protection of the law into facts of life for all Americans.""",0.0

Trump has told advisers he worries about his safety, while both privately and publicly praising the work of the Secret Service. Demonstrators returned Sunday afternoon, facing off against police at Lafayette Park into the evening. Trump retweeted a message from a conservative commentator encouraging authorities to respond with greater force. ""This isn't going to stop until the good guys are willing to use overwhelming force against the bad guys,"" Buck Sexton wrote in a message amplified by the president. In recent days security at the White House has been reinforced by the National Guard and additional personnel from the Secret Service and the U.S. Park Police. The Justice Department deployed members of the U.S. Marshals Service and agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration to supplement National Guard troops outside the White House, according to a senior Justice Department official. The official could not discuss the matter publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity.",0.0

Chris Sununu said he disagrees with President Trump’s calls on Monday for governors to “dominate” people taking to the streets to protest the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police. Sununu said he supports the protesters who gathered over the weekend in Manchester, and while he told reporters he didn’t want to get into Trump’s statements, Sununu said they don’t reflect his approach in what he called a time of uncertainty. “No, I don’t think anyone needs to be dominated,” Sununu said. “If anything, here in New Hampshire, I think we’ve shown working together in a very peaceful and constructive way is a pathway to success. Now, when the violence we have seen break out in other parts of the country breaks out, I can tell you we are going to deal with it, absolutely.” Sununu also took issue with any suggestion that the threat of spread of coronavirus should have prompted authorities to limit the Manchester Black Lives Matter protest. Sununu said he reached out to organizers before the march Saturday morning and hopes it fosters “an ongoing discussion that we need to continually have.” ""So, the important conversation, we just want to make sure does continue,” Sununu said. “It’s a constructive one, one of positivity. The message does have to be heard. But we are not going to condone or accept violence by any individuals against anyone’s small business, anyone’s property, any community.” Several communities across the state, including Hampton and Dover, saw peaceful gatherings Monday to protest Floyd’s death. The Manchester chapter of Black Lives Matter is hosting a candlelight vigil Tuesday evening, to honor the lives of African Americans killed by police. Organizers said they have alerted police about the gathering and expect it to be peaceful.",0.0
1622845962,2020-06-01 23:53:00,'Hate just hides': Biden vows to take on systematic racism,https://www.wmur.com/article/hate-just-hides-biden-vows-to-take-on-systematic-racism/32734216,en,False,,367524,wmur.com,http://wmur.com/,"Advertisement 'Hate just hides': Biden vows to take on systematic racism Share Shares Copy Link Copy Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden vowed to address institutional racism in his first 100 days in office as he sought to elevate his voice Monday in the exploding national debate over racism and police brutality.The former vice president offered emotional support and promised bold action during an in-person discussion with black leaders in Delaware and a subsequent virtual meeting with big-city mayors who are grappling with racial tensions and frustrated by a lack of federal support.“Hate just hides. It doesn’t go away, and when you have somebody in power who breathes oxygen into the hate under the rocks, it comes out from under the rocks,” Biden told more than a dozen African American leaders gathered at a church in downtown Wilmington, his face mask lowered around his chin as he spoke.Without offering specifics, he promised to “deal with institutional racism” and set up a police oversight body in his first 100 days in office, if elected. Biden also said he'd be releasing an economic plan focused on education, housing and “access to capital"" and investments, especially for minority Americans, later this month. “I really do believe that the blinders have been taken off. I think this tidal wave is moving,” Biden told the mayors of Atlanta, Chicago, Los Angeles and St. Paul, Minnesota. “I realize we’ve got to do something big, we can do it, and everyone will benefit from it.”Biden has struggled in recent weeks to be heard from his makeshift home TV studio over the noise of dueling national crises. But after another night of violent protests, he ventured out into public for the second time in two days and just the third time since the pandemic arrived in mid March.His hopeful and collaborative approach marked a sharp contrast to that of President Donald Trump. The Republican president slammed governors as “weak” during a video teleconference on Monday and demanded tougher crackdowns on protesters. Trump also lashed out at Biden on Twitter, writing that “Sleepy Joe Biden’s people are so Radical Left that they are working to get the Anarchists out of jail, and probably more.”Biden's softer style may foreshadow how he presents himself in the five months before the presidential election, emphasizing calm and competence as a contrast to a mercurial president. It is an approach that carries the risk of being drowned out by Trump's much louder voice. “He’s not in office, and he certainly does not have the megaphone like the person currently occupying the White House does, but I do think our people are looking for someone who can make them feel better during these extremely tough times,” said Rep. Val Demings of Florida, whom Biden is considering as a running mate. “America just needs to be reassured that there’s someone who’s understanding, someone who’s willing to say, ‘Yes, we do have some issues,’ and someone who’s willing to address it.”Biden delivered a well-received address on Friday calling on white people to shoulder the responsibility of ending America’s systemic racism. But he was largely out of sight over the weekend, which marked the fifth anniversary of the death of his son Beau Biden from brain cancer.Biden and his wife, Jill, marked Memorial Day by laying a wreath at a veterans' memorial near his Wilmington home, and the former vice president’s campaign posted pictures of him visiting a protest site in the city on Sunday afternoon. Earlier, he wrote a post on Medium expressing empathy for those despairing about the police killing of George Floyd.In the early moments of Monday’s gathering at the Bethel AME church in Wilmington, Biden listened quietly and took notes. All the attendees, including Biden, wore face masks but lowered them as they spoke.“The vice president came to hear from us. This is a homeboy,” pastor Sylvester Beaman said before everyone bowed their heads in prayer.Biden's standing with the black community weighs heavily as he works to deny Trump a second term. African Americans rescued Biden's flailing primary campaign, but it's unclear if they will turn out for him in large numbers in November. “I want to make something clear. I don’t expect anything from the black community,"" Biden said Monday, insisting he has never taken its support for granted. The former vice president has been doing cleanup since telling a prominent black radio host a week and a half ago that African Americans who back Trump “ain’t black.”Yet the mayors who spoke with Biden, three of whom are black, were clearly frustrated and angry with Trump, who has offered military support to address violent protests while denying them federal support to address the coronavirus fallout and repeatedly attacking them on social media. “To see the president of the United States say that he's going to send the military into our communities but hadn't mentioned sending a single dime of support into our communities, speaks to where we are in America,” said Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms. Much of Biden's campaign strategy centers on trying to draw a contrast with Trump on temperament and values. He has called the White House contest a battle for the soul of the nation and has been particularly forceful in condemning Trump's handling of moments of racial tension. In an election that is likely to be a referendum on the sitting president, some Biden aides say privately that the best plan may be to let Trump do himself in.Yet there is also a recognition that Biden needs to do more than simply wait for voters who may be turned off by Trump to turn toward him. Some Democrats who have criticized Biden for not being more visible during the onset of the coronavirus said he is making the right moves now.“I’m sure they have some reluctance, understandably, right now to politicize it. That's not who he is,"" said Democratic strategist James Carville. “There might be a time for eloquence, but I think that simplicity is eloquence right now.”",0.0

On Sunday night, the twins and members of the Patriots secondary held a round table discussion on their Double Coverage Podcast. For almost an hour and 15 minutes, the McCourty’s interviewed multiple people who are actively trying to bring change. They also answered questions and discussed their own personal feelings on the ongoing racial problems in this country. ""Me and Dev just thought with everything going on in the country, we’d spend some time just to talk about it,"" Jason McCourty said in the podcast. ""Sports is obviously something that plays a huge role in our loves, but right now sports doesn’t seem like something that is very important. There’s a lot of things going on in our country from the pandemic to the racial issues that have gone on and plagued our country for hundreds and hundreds of years. We just wanted to open up our platform and be able to discuss some of these things."" This isn’t out of the ordinary for the McCourty twins.

Their work in the community led to a nomination for the 2020 Muhammad Ali Sports Humanitarian Award, which is given to athletes who have created positive impacts in their communities. Last year, the McCourty’s along with Matthew Slater and Duron Harmon, fought to get an education bill passed in Massachusetts. In October, the Massachusetts House of Representatives and Senate unanimously passed the Student Opportunity Act. The bill will invest $1.5 billion into the states public education school system. ""That’s part of it,"" Jason McCourty said. ""When you can attack legislation and get laws and the system changed, that’s going to bring a real impact. But we can’t expect that to happen over night. It’s been hundreds of years in the process of being made the way it is."" It wasn’t long ago that peaceful protests broke out in the NFL. Started by former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick, players started to kneel during the National Anthem to bring awareness to social injustice. In 2017, following disparaging comments and tweets from President Donald Trump, Patriots players even knelt during the anthem before a game against the Houston Texans. The players were booed in Gillette Stadium for their action while people who disagreed with the action said they were disrespecting the military and country. On Sunday, Devin McCourty said it was sadly ironic that people disparaged Kaepernick while years later a black man was killed when Minneapolis, Minn., police officer Derek Chauvin knelt on his neck for 8 minutes and 46 seconds. ""Look at Kaepernick. A couple years ago, people were going crazy. ‘This guy is this, he’s that,’"" Devin McCourty said. ""Then, the irony of a man losing his life because a knee is in his neck and now, all of a sudden, people are like, oh man, let me take an extra second to listen to what Kaepernick said in an interview about why he took a knee and why he did a silent protest. ""When you listen to it, it’s like oh, that’s kind of how I feel right now after watching that video. It’s like, if you ever stopped and listen to what he was doing and his true message, it would have never got to that point and you would have never talked about the military, you would have never talked about the flag.

He talked about being an African American in a workplace where he is the overwhelming minority. Quaye, who is a part of his company’s diversity council, aims to help open doors for other minorities looking to get into the industry by educating youth. The McCourty twins spoke with former Rutgers linebacker Antonio Lowery, who is an African American police officer in Miami. He spoke about how he was taught that police offers were ‘bad’ and ‘dangerous’ while growing up. Lowery says he wants to ""change the narrative"" and he takes time to mentor kids. The brothers then spoke with Pat Brown, a former Rutgers wide receiver, who is the football coach at Seabreeze High School in Daytona Beach, Florida. He spoke about trying to bring student athletes together who come from different backgrounds in regards to race and family wealth. The McCourty twins also discussed about how people can invest in their community to make a difference and how a simple talk with someone can go a long way.

""Look at Kaepernick. A couple years ago, people were going crazy. ‘This guy is this, he’s that,’"" Devin McCourty said. ""Then, the irony of a man losing his life because a knee is in his neck and now, all of a sudden, people are like, oh man, let me take an extra second to listen to what Kaepernick said in an interview about why he took a knee and why he did a silent protest. ""When you listen to it, it’s like oh, that’s kind of how I feel right now after watching that video. It’s like, if you ever stopped and listen to what he was doing and his true message, it would have never got to that point and you would have never talked about the military, you would have never talked about the flag. You would’ve understood he was talking about freedom."" On the podcast, the brothers also talked with their former Rutgers teammate Chris Quaye, who is a private banker at Morgan Stanley. He talked about being an African American in a workplace where he is the overwhelming minority. Quaye, who is a part of his company’s diversity council, aims to help open doors for other minorities looking to get into the industry by educating youth. The McCourty twins spoke with former Rutgers linebacker Antonio Lowery, who is an African American police officer in Miami. He spoke about how he was taught that police offers were ‘bad’ and ‘dangerous’ while growing up. Lowery says he wants to ""change the narrative"" and he takes time to mentor kids. The brothers then spoke with Pat Brown, a former Rutgers wide receiver, who is the football coach at Seabreeze High School in Daytona Beach, Florida. He spoke about trying to bring student athletes together who come from different backgrounds in regards to race and family wealth. The McCourty twins also discussed about how people can invest in their community to make a difference and how a simple talk with someone can go a long way. ""We have to take advantage of the platform we have while we have it,"" said Jason McCourty. ""Once you retire you can do it, but it’s almost too late to demand the audience the people that you have.

THERE’S NOTHING Advertisement FBI to investigate death of black restaurant owner by law enforcement in Louisville Share Shares Copy Link Copy Authorities are investigating the death of a black restaurant owner in Louisville, Kentucky, including FBI Louisville, Kentucky State Police and the U.S. Attorney's Office. David McAtee was shot and killed by law enforcement as they broke up a crowd early Monday morning in Louisville, officials said.Steve Conrad, who was Louisville Metro Police Department's chief at the time, went to the scene shortly after it happened to give details. He said the incident happened around 12:15 a.m. in the parking lot of Dino's Food Mart, located at 26th and Broadway.McAtee owned a restaurant nearby called Yaya's BBQ.Mayor Greg Fischer called McAtee a wonderful citizen, and said many knew him as ""the BBQ man.""Conrad said LMPD and the National Guard were breaking up a large group at that location when someone fired at them. Law enforcement then returned fire, police said. Police said they have several persons of interest being interviewed and it is still unclear who fired the first shot and who struck McAtee.“It’s very clear that many people do not trust the police. That is an issue we’re going to work on and work through,"" Conrad said during an early morning news conference.Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear held a news conference around noon saying to his understanding, there was significant footage of what happened, including from body cameras. He called on all of it to be released quickly.“I’m not asking people to trust our account (of what happened). I want to see the video for ourselves,” Beshear said.It was later learned that none of the LMPD officers present had their cameras activated. Two LMPD officers on the scene who police confirm were involved, Kate Crews and Allen Austin, have been put on administrative leave.The governor said he has heard the crowd at that food mart was not demonstrating at the time, but police responded because they were violating curfew.A curfew went into effect Sunday night at 9 p.m. for the whole city. That curfew has since been extended through June 8.It was an attempt by the mayor to settle unrest that has gone on for several days in the city over the Breonna Taylor case and other cases causing protests and riots across the country.Beshear also had Taylor's mother speak Monday, during which she said, ""We can't get justice with violence.""Seven people were shot the first day of protests in Louisville. The first few days resulted in heavy damage, vandalism and small fires around the city. Beshear is encouraging peaceful protests moving forward.",0.0

It Has to be Heard. It Is Not a One-Day Message, and It Isn’t Just a One-Day Discussion. It Has to Be Ongoing, and It Has to Lead to Action in a Variety of Different Ways.” In an interview with WKXL’s Chris Ryan, Governor Chris Sununu discusses how cities across the country are dealing with protests of the death of George Floyd, an African American who was killed while in police custody in Minneapolis. Some cities have had peaceful protests, while in other cities, the protests have turned into riots with looting, attacks on the police, and destruction of property. Governor Sununu gives background as to why the protests in Manchester were peaceful, and he gives much credit for deescalating the situation to Manchester Police Chief Carl Capano and his police officers. The Governor wants there to be a dialogue between law enforcement and the community which will develop better understanding. However, Governor Sununu is clear that his job is to protect the health and safety of our communities by coordinating the use of local and state police and the National Guard if necessary. When he was asked if President Trump’s tweets and comments have fueled the protests, Governor Sununu said, “I don’t read the President’s tweets. I’m really not paying attention to the President in this right now. I’m focused on what’s happening in New Hampshire right now and across New England. This is not fake news.” The final portion of the interview deals with the potential spread of COVID-19 while large groups of people are assembling for protests. The Governor is confident that there is enough testing materials and PPE-Personal Protection Equipment and systems in place to weather a possible increase Coronavirus cases.",0.0

Live results will appear Tuesday evening. Presidential primaries press on. Former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee, has not yet officially clinched the nomination. He went into the day 425 delegates short of the magic number of 1,991. With 500 delegates at stake Tuesday, he needs 85% of the delegates up for grabs, which he's unlikely to get. More likely, Biden will cross the threshold next week, June 9, when Georgia and West Virginia vote, with their 133 delegates at stake (and when we'll get the results of Pennsylvania's primary, with its 186 delegates). Rep. Steve King on the ropes. The controversial Iowa conservative faces real danger in his primary for reelection from Iowa's 4th Congressional District. After racist and pro-white nationalist remarks, much of the Republican establishment abandoned King. They've come for him before in his almost 20 years in Congress unsuccessfully. But this has been their best chance so far. King has trailed in the polls, with only $30,000 cash on hand and no TV ads running. The favorite among his challengers has been state Sen. Randy Feenstra, who has painted King as ineffective in the House, given that he was stripped of key committee assignments. But King is well known as a familiar choice for conservatives in western Iowa and has been resilient. Polls close at 10 p.m. ET Loading... In Iowa's 2nd Congressional District, Democratic Rep. Dave Loebsack is retiring, opening up his seat. Former state Sen. Rita Hart will be the Democratic nominee and will face either state Sen. Mariannette Miller-Meeks or ex-Illinois Congressman Bobby Schilling, who moved to Iowa in 2017. Miller-Meeks got the backing of Gov. Kim Reynolds and Sen. Joni Ernst, as well as House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. Former Sen. Rick Santorum and Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, a top Trump ally, have backed Schilling. Polls close at 10 p.m. ET Loading... Steny Hoyer faces a challenge from the left. A veteran lawmaker from Maryland's 5th Congressional District and No. 2 in House Democratic leadership, Hoyer faces a progressive primary challenge from 29-year-old Mckayla Wilkes. Wilkes, a single mother, was inspired by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's victory in New York in 2018 over another veteran white male Democratic leader. Wilkes raised $300,000 and said Hoyer, who has been in Congress almost 40 years, is out of touch with the district. The Democratic establishment has remained behind Hoyer, though, including the Congressional Black Caucus, which endorsed him. He has outspent Wilkes $2.7 million to $237,000. Polls close at 8 p.m. ET Loading... Spy games in New Mexico. The announced retirement of New Mexico Sen. Tom Udall set off a domino effect. Democratic Rep. Ben Ray Luján declared for Udall's Senate seat, leaving open his seat in the 3rd Congressional District. Enter: Valerie Plame, the ex-CIA agent. She has raised and spent more than any candidate in this race and gained national attention with her glossy campaign ad showing her racing backward in a Chevy Camaro on a dusty road. But locally, her candidacy has looked less like an easy Sunday drive. She faced criticism for being a relative newcomer, moving to the area in 2007; the district is 41% Latino and 19% Native American, and another candidate, Teresa Leger Fernandez, got the endorsements of the political arm of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and EMILY's List. Polls close at 9 p.m. ET Loading... It is very possible that New Mexico sends an all-female House delegation to Congress in 2021, as freshman Democrats Deb Haaland and Xochitl Torres Small are the incumbents in the state's other two districts. But Torres Small has to win what's expected to be a tough reelection race in the 2nd District. Trump won there by 10 points in 2016, and the primary to decide who will take on Torres Small this fall is a contest between two Republican women. It has been a nasty primary between Yvette Herrell, the 2018 nominee, and Claire Chase, an oil executive. Both have campaigned on who's the most pro-Trump; Herrell got the backing of the House Freedom Caucus, but Chase has outraised and outspent Herrell, with support from Defending Main Street, a group with ties to establishment Republicans. Polls close at 9 p.m. ET Loading... Senate matchups to be set in Iowa and Montana. Democrats are hoping to take back the Senate this fall. They have an outside shot at that right now, but their odds have looked increasingly better of late. Partially, that's because of these two races. In Iowa, Democrats are targeting incumbent Republican Joni Ernst, but first there's the primary Tuesday. The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee has backed real estate executive Theresa Greenfield in the four-way contest. Greenfield raised $7.1 million and went into Tuesday as the favorite. Other Democrats include retired Adm. Mike Franken, attorney Kimberly Graham and Eddie Mauro, a businessman and former teacher and coach who has spent the second most — $1.4 million — on this primary. Polls close at 10 p.m. ET Loading... When Montana Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock changed his mind and decided to challenge incumbent Republican Sen. Steve Daines, it suddenly put this race on the map for Democrats in a big way. Three other Democrats are on the ballot Tuesday, but Bullock has been expected to win easily, raising more than 10 times what his next opponent has. Polls close at 10 p.m. ET Loading... Indiana openings. The retirements of moderate Democrat Pete Visclosky in Indiana's 1st District and Republican Susan Brooks, one of only 13 Republican women in Congress, in the 5th District has opened up both of these ideologically divergent seats. More than half a dozen Democrats are competing in the 1st District, which is suburban and exurban Chicago, a place that went for Hillary Clinton with 54% of the vote in 2016. Polls close at 7 p.m. ET Loading... In the 5th District, a handful of Republicans have duked it out, including state Sen. Victoria Spartz, who raised and spent the most and got the backing of the Club for Growth, and Beth Henderson, a local businesswoman with the endorsement of Indiana Sen. Mike Braun. Democrats have rallied around one candidate, Christina Hale. This district has been in GOP hands for a long time, but it could be one to watch this fall. The Cook Political Report lists it as only ""lean Republican."" Trump won it with 53% in 2016.

1623233482,2020-06-02 07:44:34,Governors Push Back On Trump's Threat To Deploy Federal Troops To Quell Unrest,https://www.nhpr.org/post/governors-push-back-trumps-threat-deploy-federal-troops-quell-unrest,en,False,,22716,nhpr.org,http://www.nhpr.org,"Updated at 10:33 a.m. ET President Trump, in a conference call Monday with the nation's governors, threatened to deploy the U.S. military to restore order unless states hit by days of unrest ""put down"" violent demonstrations, urging leaders to ""dominate"" lawbreakers or risk looking like ""a bunch of jerks."" The upbraiding from the White House didn't sit well with many governors, who have been busy responding to clashes between protesters and law enforcement in dozens of U.S. cities sparked by the death a week ago of George Floyd after a Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck. Trump took a tough line with the governors, saying he was putting Attorney General William Barr in charge of the federal law enforcement response. The president said the White House was ""strongly looking for arrests."" ""You have to arrest people and you have to try people. And they have to go to jail for long periods of time,"" the president said. ""If people are running amok, you have to dominate. If you aren't dominating, you're wasting your time,"" he said. ""They're going to run over you; you're going to look like a bunch of jerks."" ""It's a movement. If you don't put it down, it will get worse and worse,"" Trump said. ""The only time it's successful is when you're weak and most of you are weak."" The call followed yet another night of unrest Sunday over the May 25 death of Floyd and came on the same day that the president in a Rose Garden address urged governors deploy National Guard troops to quell the unrest. ""If a city or state refuses to take the actions that are necessary to defend the life and property of their residents, then I will deploy the United States military and quickly solve the problem for them,"" he said. In the nation's capital, where U.S. Secret Service uniformed officers, military police and other law enforcement on Monday fired tear gas on peaceful protesters outside of the White House, Trump said he was already ""dispatching thousands and thousands of heavily armed soldiers, military personnel and law enforcement officers to stop the rioting, looting, vandalism, assaults and the wanton destruction of property."" While some governors, such as South Carolina's Henry McMaster, a Republican, praised Trump's calls for a crackdown, others took umbrage at the president's combative tone and questioned his authority to unilaterally deploy federal troops to the states. During the conference call, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, a Democrat, warned the president that the ""rhetoric coming out of the White House is making it worse,"" to which Trump snapped back, ""I don't like your rhetoric that much either."" ""I had to speak up, and I told him that his rhetoric is inflaming matters, that it's making things worse, and that we need to call for police reform,"" Pritzker told NPR's Morning Edition on Tuesday. ""We need to call for calm, that that's what the president should do and we need national leadership in this regard."" ""He unfortunately — you know,"" the governor added, ""he reacted badly."" Pritzker also said that what Trump's suggesting is ""illegal."" ""The governor of a state has to ask for federal help. I don't know any governor that intends to do that,"" he said. ""And secondly, you know, you can hear in his rhetoric that he is simply trying to make himself sound like a strong man — almost like a dictator, as if he's going to be responsible for bringing order all the way."" In Michigan, where police and protesters have skirmished in Grand Rapids despite many demonstrations remaining peaceful, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, called the president's remarks ""dangerous"" and said they should be ""gravely concerning to all Americans."" The president's comments, she said, ""send a clear signal that this administration is determined to sow the seeds of hatred and division, which I fear will only lead to more violence and destruction."" ""We must reject this way of thinking. This is a moment that calls for empathy, humanity, and unity,"" Whitmer said in a statement. ""This is one of the most challenging periods in our nation's history, but as Americans, we must remember our enemy is racial injustice, not one another."" The Republican governor of Massachusetts, Charlie Baker, said he wasn't surprised by the president's ""incendiary words."" ""At so many times during these last several weeks, when the country needed compassion and leadership the most, it simply was nowhere to be found,"" he said following the phone call with Trump. ""Instead, we got bitterness, combativeness and self-interest. That's not what we need in Boston, it's not what we need right now in Massachusetts,"" he said as his voice cracked with emotion, ""and it's definitely not what we need across this great country of ours either."" Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, a Democrat, called the president's remarks the ""rantings of an insecure man trying to look strong after building his entire political career on racism."" On the subject of the deploying of federal troops, Democratic New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo told CNN that he would respond to such an offer by saying, ""Thank you, but no thank you."" ""He wants to make this about looting because he doesn't want to talk about the killing of Mr. Floyd,"" Cuomo said. ""[He] doesn't want to really talk about racism and discrimination."" Kentucky Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear was reportedly not on the call with the president. Beshear was instead talking with the mother of Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old African American resident of Louisville who was killed in March by police executing a no-knock warrant. The president did praise one Democratic governor for his response to the unrest — Minnesota's Tim Walz, who fully mobilized National Guard troops on Saturday to supplement law enforcement. But at another point in the call, Trump called Minnesota ""a laughingstock all over the world."" Walz said Monday that he responded by saying: ""No one's laughing here. We're in pain. We're crying. We saw a man lose his life in front of them and our challenge is that this is about social trust, social compacts and reestablishing faith in the people who are there to serve them.""

1623264100,2020-06-02 08:45:00,Commentary: A wave of protests puts a spotlight on U.S. hypocrisy,https://www.concordmonitor.com/US-hypocrisy-34560106,en,False,,29410,concordmonitor.com,http://www.concordmonitor.com#spider,"People take part in a Black Lives Matter protest in Trafalgar Square in London Sunday to protest against the recent killing of George Floyd by police officers in Minneapolis. AP President Donald Trump may be uniquely bad at bringing a wounded, divided country together. Throughout six consecutive days of unrest in cities across the country, triggered by the death of George Floyd, an unarmed black man, in the custody a Minneapolis police officer who knelt on Floyd’s neck for nearly nine minutes – Trump pledged military retribution on protesters engaged in unlawful acts, dismissed their outrage as the work of leftist troublemakers, and said nothing of reports of heavy-handed police actions during the demonstrations. And all this comes at a time when Americans are reeling from an epochal economic collapse and the toll of the coronavirus pandemic. “President Trump has spewed division with ill-chosen tweets about looting and ‘shooting’ or ‘vicious dogs’ and overpowering weapons,” wrote my colleague Dan Balz. “He has attacked Democratic leaders as their communities burn. He flails rather than leads, his instincts all wrong for what confronts the country.” “Trump makes little disguise of conjuring a pre-civil rights America where white males held uncontested sway,” wrote Edward Luce of the Financial Times. “He will blame [former president Barack] Obama, China, radical leftists and ‘thugs’ for America’s unhappy condition – anybody, in other words, but himself.” Under Trump, the United States has already scaled back its defense of human rights and the rule of law in other parts of the world. Now the events of the past week have unfurled like the kind of catalogue of abuses you’d see documented by U.S.-based rights groups in countries elsewhere: Journalists and protesters blinded and maimed by local police? Check. A demagogic leader stirring rage against the free press? Check. Security forces targeting unarmed demonstrators with seeming impunity and even ramming their vehicles into crowds? Check and, yes, check. The rest of the world is paying attention. Black Lives Matter protests sprung up in cities including London, Berlin and Toronto. Thousands marched through Trafalgar Square. In soccer matches held in empty stadiums in Germany, some star athletes demonstrated in solidarity with George Floyd and other black victims of police brutality in the United States. In Lebanon, where mass anti-government protests have rocked Beirut and other cities, the top trending hashtag on social media shifted to acknowledge the American uprisings thousands of miles away. America’s putative foreign adversaries also are watching. “This incident is far from the first in a series of lawless conduct and unjustified violence from U.S. law enforcement,” the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement, adding to the Kremlin’s long history of pointing to human rights abuses in the United States. “American police commit such high-profile crimes all too often.” Officials in Iran did the same, calling out racial injustice in America. “If you’re dark-skinned walking in the US, you can’t be sure you’ll be alive in the next few minutes,” read a tweet from an account associated with Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran’s supreme leader, which was accompanied by a video that detailed the horrific history of slavery in the United States. And then there was China. Already locked in a spiraling geopolitical confrontation with Washington, officials in Beijing seized on the protests to push back against the Trump administration’s assertive messaging on Hong Kong, a city whose unique autonomy is being dramatically curtailed by China. Hua Chunying, chief spokesperson of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, responded on Twitter to a message of support for Hong Kong from her State Department counterpart Morgan Ortagus with the phrase “I can’t breathe” – the dying words of multiple unarmed black men put in chokeholds by U.S. police officers that has become a global protest slogan. “There are different reasons for the riots, but their similarities are overwhelming: they all defy the law, subvert order, and are destructive,” Hu Xijin, the nationalist editor of the Global Times, a state-affiliated newspaper, said in a tweeted video, in which he applauded Beijing’s “restraint” for not cheering the protests the way Washington celebrated Hong Kong’s demonstrations. This is all very convenient for China’s leadership. “The timing of the current unrest in the United States could not be better for China’s purposes,” wrote my colleague Anna Fifield. “It is not China’s rise that is scary, the authorities are saying between the lines, but the United States’ decline. It also feeds into the prevailing view in Beijing that all of the Trump administration’s actions are designed to stop China’s rejuvenation and its elevation to what it sees as its rightful place at the top of the global hierarchy.” In Washington, Trump officials waded into the propaganda battle. “The difference between our country and many of the authoritarian countries out there, when something like this happens, we investigate it,” national security adviser Robert C. O’Brien said Sunday during an appearance on ABC’s This Week. “Our people protest. They petition their government for redress. And we stand with the protesters.” But in the same conversation, O’Brien denounced the radical elements and outside agitators fomenting trouble during the protests – a script that would be familiar to anyone who has listened to pro-Beijing talking points over the past year of demonstrations in Hong Kong. For months, the Western media, as well as U.S. officials, pointed to the heavy-handedness of local security forces in Hong Kong as one of the main factors that drove the protests. As scenes of police officers brutalizing protesters and journalists flood social media in the United States, there’s no chance Trump or his allies would see matters in that same frame. Trump’s stance here is not that different from the cynical autocrats O’Brien sets the United States against. It isn’t anchored in any principled defense of private property: Trump, after all, celebrated the destructive “yellow vest” protests in France – where anti-establishment demonstrators repeatedly ransacked and vandalized sections of Paris, initially in anger over a proposed carbon tax – because it allowed him to grandstand against French President Emmanuel Macron’s climate activism. And like Beijing’s dismissal of the concerns of Hong Kong’s protesters, incensed about the threat to their political freedoms, Trump has shown little empathy for the deep-seated grievances of Americans rising up against systemic racism. “What the country needs and wants from the president, they’re not going to get,” Al Cardenas, a Florida-based Republican strategist and a former chairman of the American Conservative Union, told my colleagues. “This president, I don’t believe, relates to the racism, relates to the pain. At least I haven’t seen it.”",0.0

Thanks for hospitality. Teoh. All the elected officials that air here bring ingredients. I can't breathe. I can't breathe. George floors last words, but they didn't die with him. You're still being heard going all across this nation. They speak to a nation where too often, just the color of your skin put your life at risk. They speak to the nation were more than 100,000 people have lost their lives a virus and 40 million have filed for unemployment. With the disproportionate number of those deaths and job losses concentrated black and brown communities, they speak to a nation where every day millions of people and millions not at the moment of losing their life but in the course of living their life are saying to themselves, I can't breathe. It's a wake up call to our nation. In my view, it's for all of us, and I mean all of us. It's not the first time we've heard those words. They're the same words we heard from Eric Garner when his life was taken away six years ago. But it's time to listen to those words, to try to understand, to respond to him respond with action. A country is crying out for leadership leadership that can you. Nine US leadership That brings us together. Leadership that could recognize pain and deep grief of communities that have had a knee on the neck for a long time. There's no place for violence, no place for looting or destroying property or burning churches. There's during businesses. Many have been built by the very people of color who are first time in their lives, are beginning to realize their dreams and bill wealth for their families. Nor is it acceptable for police sworn to protect and serve all people escalate tension, resort to excessive violence, way need to distinguish between legitimate peaceful protests and opportunistic, violent destruction. We have to be vigilant about the violence that's being done by this incumbent president, to our economy and to the pursuit of justice. Would peaceful protesters dispersed in order for a president, a president from the doorstep of the People's House, the White House, using tear gas and flash grenades in order to stage a photo op? A photo of one of the most historic churches in the country, or at least in Washington, D. C. We can be forgiven for believing the president's more interesting in power, then in principle were just serving the passions of his based on the needs of the people in his care, for that's what the presidency is, the duty to care, to care for all of us, not just those who vote for us, but all of us, not just our donors, but all of us. The president held up the Bible at ST John's Church. I just wish he opened it once in a while, said a brandishing. If he opened it, he could have learned something. They're all called love one another as we love ourselves. It's really hard work, but it's the work of America. Donald Trump is interested in doing that work. Instead, he's preening and sweeping away all the guard rails. Lo have protected our democracy guard rails. I helped make possible this nation's path to a more perfect union, a union that constantly requires reform and rededication. And, yes, the protest from voices that are mistreated, ignored, left out or left behind. But it is a union you worth fighting for. That's why I'm running for pressure. In addition of the Bible, the president might also want open the U. S. Constitution. If he did, he'd find a thing called the First Amendment What it says, Beginning says the right of the people peaceably to assemble and to petition their government for redress of grievances. That's kind of an essential motion building into this country, Mr President. That's America. That's America. No horses rising up on their hind legs to push back peaceful protests, not using the American military to move against the American people. This is a nation of values. Our freedom to speak is a cherished knowledge that lives inside every American. Almost from the time your kids we're gonna allow any president to quiet our voice. We won't let those who see this is an opportunity to sow chaos. Throw up a smokescreen to distract us and very really religion legitimate grievances. At the heart of these protests, we can We can't leave this moment. I can't leave this moment thinking that we can once again turn away and do nothing. Can't do that this time. We just can't. The moment has come for our nation to deal with systemic graces to deal with the growing economic inequity that exists in our nation to deal with the denial of the promise of this nation made to so many. No, I've said from the outset of this election that were in the battle for the soul of this nation. We are in the battle for the soul of a nation. What we believe, maybe most importantly, who we want to be. It's all steak that's sure today than it's ever been leased in my lifetime. And it's this urgent. It's in the services we can find a path forward. Now the history of this nation teaches us that is some of our darkest moments of despair. We've made some of our greatest progress somewhere. Darkest moment. 13 14 15th Amendments follow the Civil War The greatest economic growth in world history grew out of the Great Depression. Civil Rights Act of 1964 and 65. Voting Rights Act of 65 came in the tracks of Bull Connor's vicious dogs. Prior phrase Reverend Barber. It's the morning we find hope. It's in the morning. We find hope when we more it's gonna take more than talk. Had talked before, read protest before we've got a now vowed to make this at least in their of action and reverse the systemic racism with a long overdue concrete changes. The action will not be completed in the 1st 100 days of my presidency. If I'm fortunate to be elected or even in my entire term, it's gonna take the work of a generation. But if this agenda will take time to complete, it should not wait for the 1st 100 days of my presidency to get started. A down payment, What is long overdue should come now should come immediately. I call in the Congress to act this month on measures that would be the first step in this direction, starting with real police reform. Congressman Jeffries has a bill to outlaw. Joe calls. Congress should put it on the president's desk in the next few days. The other measures to stop transferring weapons of war to police forces improve oversight and accountability to create a model use of force standard that also should be made long this month. No more excuses, no delays. If Mitch McConnell can bring in the United States Senate to confirm Trump's on qualified judicial nominees who will run roughshod over our constitution now it's time to pass legislation will give true meaning to our constitutional promise of equal protection under the law. Looking ahead, in the 1st 100 days of my presidency, I've committed to creating a national police oversight Commission. I've long believed we need riel community policing. We need each and every police Department of Country to understand a comprehensive review of the undertaking conference review of their hiring, their training de escalation. Some have already done it somehow are in the process of doing it. The federal government should give give the cities and states the tools and the resources they need to implement reforms. More police officers meet the higher standards of the procession. Most of them do it all. The more reason why bad cops should be dealt with severely and swiftly. We all need to take a hard look at the culture allows for the senseless tragedies to keep happening. We need to learn from the cities in the precincts that are getting it right. We know though we have in order to have true American justice, we need economic justice as well. Here, too, is there's much to be done. As a media step. Congress should act should act now to rectify racial inequities that allow Cove in 19 recovery funds to be diverted from where they live. I'll be setting forth my Jenna and economic justice and opportunity in the weeks and months ahead. But it begins with health care. Health care should be a right, not a privilege of the quickest route to universal coverage of this country's expand on Obama care. We could do it. We should do it. But this president, even now in the midst of a public health crisis with massive unemployment, well want to destroy it. He doesn't care how many millions Americans will be hurt because he's consumed with his blind. Any go when it comes to Barack Obama. President Obama. The presidency would draw his lawsuit to strike down Obamacare, and the Congress should prepare to pass the act. I proposed to expand Obama care to millions Mawr. So everyone's covered his last words. We've seen America's true heroes health care workers, docks, nurses, delivery truck drivers, grocery store workers. You know, we've come up with new phrase from essential workers. Essential worker way need to do more than praise them. We need to pay them. We need to pay them because we weren't clear before. It's clear now. This country wasn't built by Wall Street bankers and CEOs was built by the great American middle class, which is built by unions and are essential workers. You know, I know there's enormous fear and uncertainty and anger in the country. I understand. I know so many Americans are suffering, suffering, loss of a loved one. So for an economic hardship, wondering, can I feed my family tomorrow? What's gonna have suffering under the weight of a generation after generation after generation, I've heard inflicted on people of color black brown in native communities in particular. Like many of you, I know what it means. Degree. My losses are not the same as loss is felt by so many. But I know what it feels like when you think you can't go on. I know what it means to have that black hole in your chest where your grief is being sucked into it. Just a few days ago, mark the fifth anniversary of my son most passing. There are still moments when the pain is so great it feels no different than the day I sat in that bed as he passed away. But I also knew, but the best way to bear loss and pain to turn it into that anger and anguish in the purpose. And Americans know what our purposes is a nation. It has to be guided. Mr. Guided guided us from the very beginning. No, it's been reported the day that President John F. Kennedy was assassinated. Little Yolanda King came home from school in Atlanta and jumped in her daddy's arms, said, Oh, Daddy, she said, Now we're never going to get our freedom. Daddy was reassuring, Strong, brave. He said, No, don't worry, baby. It's gonna be OK. It's gonna be all right. Amid the violence and fear, Dr King persevered. He was driven by his dream of a nation where justice runs down like water and righteousness like a mighty stream. Then 19 68. Hate cut him down in Memphis two days before Dr Key was murdered. Hey gave a final Sunday sermon to Washington. No, he told us that though the arc of the moral universe is long said, it bends towards justice and we know we can bend it because we have. We have to believe that still, that's our purpose. It's been our purpose in the very beginning, to become a nation where all men and women are not only creating, but they're treated equally, not just credited, would treated equally to become a nation to find, in Dr King's words, not only by the absence of tension before the presence of justice, I'm not just a not attention but justice. Today in America, it's hard to keep faith the justices hated. I know that, you know pain is raw, the pain is really president of states must be part of the solution, not the problem. But this president today is part of the problem and accelerates. When you treated the words when the looting starts, the shooting starts. They weren't the words present. Their words of a racist Miami police chief in the sixties when he tweeted the protesters quote, would have been greeted with the most vicious dogs when people would have been really hurt. End of quote. They weren't the words of a president. They were the kind of words Bull Connor would have used, unleashing his dogs on innocent women and Children. You know, the American story is a story about action and reaction that's actually works. We can't be naive about it. I wish I could say that Hate began with Donald Trump will. And with him it didn't and it won't. American history is in a fairy tale with a guaranteed happy ending. The battle for the soul of this nation has been a constant push and pull for more than 240 years, a tug of war between the American ideal that we're all created equal in the harsh reality that racism has long torn us apart. The honest truth is that both elements are part of the American character, both elements at our best. The American ideal wins out, but it's never around. It's always a fight, and the battle is never fully one. But we can't ignore the truth that we're at our best when we open our hearts rather than clinch our fish. Donald Trump has turned this country in a battlefield driven by old resentments and fresh fears. He thinks division helps him. His narcissism has become more important than the nation's well being that he leads. I ask every American I mean this in the bottom, or ask every American look at where we are now and thinking new. Is this who we are? Is this what we want to be? Is this you want to pass on to our Children and our grandchildren? Fear, anger, finger pointing, rather the pursuit of happiness, incompetence and anxiety, self absorbed selfishness? Or do we want to be the America we know? We can be American. We know in our hearts we could be and should be. Look, I look at the presidency as a very big job and nobody we'll get it right every time. And I won't either. But I promise you this. I won't traffic in fear and division. I won't fan the flames of hate. I'll seek the heal, the racial wounds that have long plagued our country, not used them for political gain. I'll do my job and I will take responsibility. I won't blame others. I'll never forget. I will never forget. I promise you, this job is not about me. It's about you. It's about us work now gone to rebuild the nation, but build it better than it was. We're the only nation of the world that goes through a crisis and comes out better to build a better future That's what America does to build a better future. We build the future. It may in fact, be the most American thing to do. Build the future. We hunger for liberty the way Harriet Tubman and Frederick Douglass did. We thirst for the vote like Susan B. Anthony and Ella Baker and John Lewis. Did we strive to explore the stars, cure disease, make an in perfect union more perfect than has been? We may come up short, but at our best we try. My fellow Americans were facing a formidable enemies. They include not only the Corona virus and the table impact on the lives and livelihoods, but also the selfishness and fear that have loomed over our national life for the last three years. I choose those words advisedly, selfishness and fear. Defeating those enemies requires us to do our duty, and that duty includes remembering who we should be, who we should be. We should be the America of F. D. R. And Eisenhower of Rosa Parks and Martin Luther King Jr. Jonah Salt. Neil Armstrong. We should be the America that cherishes life, liberty and courage, and above all, we should be in America that chairs each other each and every one of us. You know, we're a nation in pain. We must let let our pain destroys. We're nation and raged. We can not our rage consume us. We're a nation. It's exhausted. But we will not allow our exhaustion to fetus as presidents. My commitment to all of you to lead on these issues and to listen because I truly believe in my heart of hearts we can't overcome. We stand together. Finally, is one America. We'll rise stronger than we were before. We'll move that art closer to justice. We'll reach out to one another for speak out for one another. And please, please do what's recently been happening. Take care of one another. This is the United States of America. There's never been anything we've been unable to do when we set our mind to do it. We've done it together together, united. That's we are at our best. God bless you all. May God protect our troops que Mr Mayor. Thanks for hospitality. Teoh. All the elected officials that air here bring ingredients. I can't breathe. I can't breathe. George floors last words, but they didn't die with him. You're still being heard going all across this nation. They speak to a nation where too often, just the color of your skin put your life at risk. They speak to the nation were more than 100,000 people have lost their lives a virus and 40 million have filed for unemployment. With the disproportionate number of those deaths and job losses concentrated black and brown communities, they speak to a nation where every day millions of people and millions not at the moment of losing their life but in the course of living their life are saying to themselves, I can't breathe. It's a wake up call to our nation. In my view, it's for all of us, and I mean all of us. It's not the first time we've heard those words. They're the same words we heard from Eric Garner when his life was taken away six years ago. But it's time to listen to those words, to try to understand, to respond to him respond with action. A country is crying out for leadership leadership that can you. Nine US leadership That brings us together. Leadership that could recognize pain and deep grief of communities that have had a knee on the neck for a long time. There's no place for violence, no place for looting or destroying property or burning churches. There's during businesses. Many have been built by the very people of color who are first time in their lives, are beginning to realize their dreams and bill wealth for their families. Nor is it acceptable for police sworn to protect and serve all people escalate tension, resort to excessive violence, way need to distinguish between legitimate peaceful protests and opportunistic, violent destruction. We have to be vigilant about the violence that's being done by this incumbent president, to our economy and to the pursuit of justice. Would peaceful protesters dispersed in order for a president, a president from the doorstep of the People's House, the White House, using tear gas and flash grenades in order to stage a photo op? A photo of one of the most historic churches in the country, or at least in Washington, D. C. We can be forgiven for believing the president's more interesting in power, then in principle were just serving the passions of his based on the needs of the people in his care, for that's what the presidency is, the duty to care, to care for all of us, not just those who vote for us, but all of us, not just our donors, but all of us. The president held up the Bible at ST John's Church. I just wish he opened it once in a while, said a brandishing. If he opened it, he could have learned something. They're all called love one another as we love ourselves. It's really hard work, but it's the work of America. Donald Trump is interested in doing that work. Instead, he's preening and sweeping away all the guard rails. Lo have protected our democracy guard rails. I helped make possible this nation's path to a more perfect union, a union that constantly requires reform and rededication. And, yes, the protest from voices that are mistreated, ignored, left out or left behind. But it is a union you worth fighting for. That's why I'm running for pressure. In addition of the Bible, the president might also want open the U. S. Constitution. If he did, he'd find a thing called the First Amendment What it says, Beginning says the right of the people peaceably to assemble and to petition their government for redress of grievances. That's kind of an essential motion building into this country, Mr President. That's America. That's America. No horses rising up on their hind legs to push back peaceful protests, not using the American military to move against the American people. This is a nation of values. Our freedom to speak is a cherished knowledge that lives inside every American. Almost from the time your kids we're gonna allow any president to quiet our voice. We won't let those who see this is an opportunity to sow chaos. Throw up a smokescreen to distract us and very really religion legitimate grievances. At the heart of these protests, we can We can't leave this moment. I can't leave this moment thinking that we can once again turn away and do nothing. Can't do that this time. We just can't. The moment has come for our nation to deal with systemic graces to deal with the growing economic inequity that exists in our nation to deal with the denial of the promise of this nation made to so many. No, I've said from the outset of this election that were in the battle for the soul of this nation. We are in the battle for the soul of a nation. What we believe, maybe most importantly, who we want to be. It's all steak that's sure today than it's ever been leased in my lifetime. And it's this urgent. It's in the services we can find a path forward. Now the history of this nation teaches us that is some of our darkest moments of despair. We've made some of our greatest progress somewhere. Darkest moment. 13 14 15th Amendments follow the Civil War The greatest economic growth in world history grew out of the Great Depression. Civil Rights Act of 1964 and 65. Voting Rights Act of 65 came in the tracks of Bull Connor's vicious dogs. Prior phrase Reverend Barber. It's the morning we find hope. It's in the morning. We find hope when we more it's gonna take more than talk. Had talked before, read protest before we've got a now vowed to make this at least in their of action and reverse the systemic racism with a long overdue concrete changes. The action will not be completed in the 1st 100 days of my presidency. If I'm fortunate to be elected or even in my entire term, it's gonna take the work of a generation. But if this agenda will take time to complete, it should not wait for the 1st 100 days of my presidency to get started. A down payment, What is long overdue should come now should come immediately. I call in the Congress to act this month on measures that would be the first step in this direction, starting with real police reform. Congressman Jeffries has a bill to outlaw. Joe calls. Congress should put it on the president's desk in the next few days. The other measures to stop transferring weapons of war to police forces improve oversight and accountability to create a model use of force standard that also should be made long this month. No more excuses, no delays. If Mitch McConnell can bring in the United States Senate to confirm Trump's on qualified judicial nominees who will run roughshod over our constitution now it's time to pass legislation will give true meaning to our constitutional promise of equal protection under the law. Looking ahead, in the 1st 100 days of my presidency, I've committed to creating a national police oversight Commission. I've long believed we need riel community policing. We need each and every police Department of Country to understand a comprehensive review of the undertaking conference review of their hiring, their training de escalation. Some have already done it somehow are in the process of doing it. The federal government should give give the cities and states the tools and the resources they need to implement reforms. More police officers meet the higher standards of the procession. Most of them do it all. The more reason why bad cops should be dealt with severely and swiftly. We all need to take a hard look at the culture allows for the senseless tragedies to keep happening. We need to learn from the cities in the precincts that are getting it right. We know though we have in order to have true American justice, we need economic justice as well. Here, too, is there's much to be done. As a media step. Congress should act should act now to rectify racial inequities that allow Cove in 19 recovery funds to be diverted from where they live. I'll be setting forth my Jenna and economic justice and opportunity in the weeks and months ahead. But it begins with health care. Health care should be a right, not a privilege of the quickest route to universal coverage of this country's expand on Obama care. We could do it. We should do it. But this president, even now in the midst of a public health crisis with massive unemployment, well want to destroy it. He doesn't care how many millions Americans will be hurt because he's consumed with his blind. Any go when it comes to Barack Obama. President Obama. The presidency would draw his lawsuit to strike down Obamacare, and the Congress should prepare to pass the act. I proposed to expand Obama care to millions Mawr. So everyone's covered his last words. We've seen America's true heroes health care workers, docks, nurses, delivery truck drivers, grocery store workers. You know, we've come up with new phrase from essential workers. Essential worker way need to do more than praise them. We need to pay them. We need to pay them because we weren't clear before. It's clear now. This country wasn't built by Wall Street bankers and CEOs was built by the great American middle class, which is built by unions and are essential workers. You know, I know there's enormous fear and uncertainty and anger in the country. I understand. I know so many Americans are suffering, suffering, loss of a loved one.

You have. Advertisement Over 60 people arrested, 10 officers hurt during Rhode Island violence Share Shares Copy Link Copy A crowd of hundreds of people that the head of the Rhode Island State Police described as a “mob"" smashed storefront windows, broke into a closed mall and torched a police cruiser in Providence early on Tuesday morning.More than 60 people were arrested and as many as 10 police officers were injured when they were hit by rocks or bricks, authorities said.The people who caused the damage were not protesting the death of George Floyd, the Minneapolis man who died after a police officer pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes even after he stopped moving and pleading for air, authorities said.“This was a mob,” state police Col. James Manni said. “These were not protesters. This was an intentional, coordinated attack on the city.""Police received intelligence several hours prior to the violence that people were coming from out of state armed with crow bars, flares and gasoline, Manni said.Providence Mayor Jorge Elorza on Tuesday morning said five of the people arrested were from out of state.Providence Public Safety Commissioner Steven M. Paré said Tuesday that none of the hurt officers was seriously injured.The trouble started at around midnight when a crowd of 300 to 500 people gathered in the street outside the Providence Place mall, police said. At about 2 a.m. police deployed tear gas to disperse the crowd, but fireworks and sirens continued to be heard in the city for hours, according to media reports.At one point several people broke into the mall, and Manni thinks they intended to set it on fire.Manni and Elorza say the damage could have been much worse had the police not been prepared.“Last night’s incidents were devastating for our community who has already experienced so much unrest and pain,"" Elorza said in a statement. “Violence is never the answer and we need collective action - one that is productive, not destruction of our small businesses, who have been impacted so much already and by putting others safety at risk.""The mall, which reopened for the first time Monday since being closed in mid-March because of the coronavirus pandemic, was closed Tuesday, according to its website.",0.0

THERE’S NOTHING Advertisement Death toll grows in national protests Share Shares Copy Link Copy Amid protests seeking justice for a black man killed after a white police officer pressed his knee into his neck, several people have lost their lives. They include a well-known and popular owner of a barbecue spot in Louisville, Kentucky and a federal officer working security at a courthouse in Oakland. Many of these deaths have gone unnoticed, overshadowed by the turmoil roiling American cities.One man was the beloved owner of a Louisville barbecue restaurant who made sure to provide free meals to officers. Another was a man known as ""Mr. Indianapolis,"" a former star football player. Yet another was a federal officer working security during a protest.They are among the people who have been killed as protests roiled American cities in the week since 46-year-old George Floyd died when a white officer jammed his knee into the back of the black man's neck. The deaths have at times been overshadowed by the shocking images of chaos engulfing cities across America, from heavy-handed riot police tactics to violence, vandalism and arson. Tens of thousands have marched peacefully in demonstrations against police brutality and racism.Many of the people killed were African Americans, compounding the tragedy for black families to lose more members of their community amid the unrest.Dozens more have been hurt in various altercations — vehicles plowing into crowds, police officers suffering head injuries and broken bones and protesters ending up in emergency rooms with a variety of injuries from the melees.The death toll and circumstances surrounding the killings are still being sorted out in many cities, but here is what we know about the cases so far:LOUISVILLEAs local police and the National Guard sought to disperse a crowd early Monday, they heard gunshots and returned fire, killing the owner of a barbecue restaurant, David McAtee. The mayor has since terminated the city's police chief after finding out that officers on the scene did not activate their body cameras. The state police and the U.S. attorney also are investigating.The 53-year-old McAtee was an African American man known for offering free meals to officers who stopped by.""We lost a wonderful citizen named David McAtee,"" Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer said. ""David was a friend to many, a well-known Barbecue man.""The protests in Louisville have centered not just on Floyd's killing but also the death of Breonna Taylor, a black woman killed in her home in Louisville in March. The 26-year-old EMT was shot eight times by narcotics detectives who knocked down her front door as they attempted to enforce a search warrant. No drugs were found in the home.___OAKLANDA federal law enforcement officer was providing security at the federal courthouse in Oakland during a protest when someone fired shots from a vehicle.Dave Patrick Underwood, 53, died and another officer was critically injured in the shooting. It was not immediately clear if the drive-by shooting was related to the protests, though the federal building's glass doors were smashed and the front entrance was sprayed with anti-police graffiti.Underwood, who was black, and the other officer were contracted security officers and employed by the Department of Homeland Security's Federal Protective Service; they were monitoring a nearby protest. No one has been arrested and a motive for the shooting has not yet been determined. Underwood was the brother of Angela Underwood Jacobs, recently a Republican candidate to fill a vacant U.S. congressional district north of Los Angeles. ___INDIANAPOLISTwo people were killed over the weekend amid unrest in Indianapolis, including 38-year-old Chris Beaty, a former offensive lineman for Indiana University.Beaty was known as ""Mr. Indianapolis"" and remained involved with the Hoosiers long after his graduation. He also was a prominent businessman in the city and ran multiple nightclubs.""I am at a loss for words. The news of the passing of Chris Beaty is just devastating,"" coach Tom Allen said in a statement. ""Since I returned home to coach at Indiana, Chris embraced me, encouraged me and supported me! His passion for life and Indiana Football energized me every time we were together.""The circumstances of his shooting weren't immediately clear but some media reports said it happened near an apartment where he lived. It also occurred the same night that an 18-year-old man also was fatally shot as protests broke out in the city.___MINNEAPOLISIn what is believed to be the first killing since the protests broke out, a 43-year-old black man was fatally shot outside a pawn shop as rioting broke out last week in Minneapolis and then spread nationally.The owner of the pawn shop, who is white, was arrested in the death of Calvin L. Horton Jr. Police say they are investigating the circumstances surrounding the killing, including whether it was related to protests in the neighborhood.The shop was described as having been significantly damaged during unrest. ___OMAHA, NEBRASKAA 22-year-old black man was killed after authorities said he tussled with the owner of two bars in downtown Omaha. Surveillance video of the strip of bars shows a group of people, including James Scurlock, approach bar owner Jake Gardner.Two people are seen on the video tackling Gardner, who ended up on his back and fired shots in the air. Seconds later, Scurlock is seen tackling Gardner, who then fires the gun over his shoulder, striking Scurlock.Authorities have declined to press charges, calling the shooting self-defense.___DETROITA 21-year-old man was killed in downtown Detroit after someone fired shots into a vehicle during a protest.

THAT Advertisement 'We stand here just as outraged as they do': Cincinnati police chief, officers take knee with protesters Share Shares Copy Link Copy Cincinnati Police Chief Eliot Isaac and other officers took a knee Monday in solidarity with protesters as they spoke with those who gathered outside district one headquarters.Isaac said he was talking with a group of protesters when they asked him to kneel with them.""I was talking to a group of college students and they asked me, 'Chief, will you kneel with us in solidarity? You say you're against police brutality; will you do something humble and kneel with us?' and I said, 'Absolutely,' and I did and several of my officers joined me,"" Isaac said.Isaac spoke during a briefing Monday on the protests over the weekend, saying he and none of his staff believe what took place in Minneapolis was right and know law enforcement is more professional than that.""We have to move past this and those that have not made those necessary changes, they need to do that as well. I'm very proud of the work our men and women are doing,"" Isaac said. Protests in Cincinnati were largely peaceful Monday, scattered across the city's urban core and were relatively quiet, at least when compared to days prior.The protests are in honor of George Floyd. Floyd, a black man, was killed after a white officer pressed a knee into his neck while taking him into custody in Minnesota.A number of groups have been holding peaceful rallies to get the true message of their moment out, highlighting what they say are racial injustices and police brutality across the country. Organizers are asking participants to respect social distancing guidelines, wear masks and keep in groups no larger than 10 people.The protests have been followed by three nights of unrest in the city, with vandalism and looting during the first two nights.Isaac said he understands people are angry and he shares that anger and wants to talk about it.""It's never too late to talk. I understand that people are angry if we're not going to talk what's going to happen then, is this going to go on indefinitely. Yeah we need to talk; we need to talk about how to make things better; we need to talk about more reform; we need to listen to what the community is saying, particularly our young people; that's most important to me,"" Isaac said.Ohio State Sen. Cecil Thomas said his hope is that the protests continue peacefully in order for the true message to be heard.""The peaceful protesters. They done what they wanted to do. Obviously, they honored the curfew,"" Thomas said. ""Now there are people out who may be attempting to do things similar to what happened last night and the night before.""",0.0

The bishop who oversees St. John's is among the critics. ""He used violent means to ask to be escorted across the park into the courtyard of the church,"" Bishop Mariann Edgar Budde of the Episcopal Diocese of Washington tells NPR's Morning Edition. ""He held up his Bible after speaking [an] inflammatory militarized approach to the wounds of our nation."" ""He did not pray,"" the bishop continued. ""He did not offer a word of balm or condolence to those who are grieving. He did not seek to unify the country, but rather he used our symbols and our sacred space as a way to reinforce a message that is antithetical to everything that the person of Jesus, whom we follow, and the gospel texts that we strive to emulate ... represent."" Every president since James Madison has visited St. John's Church, which opened in 1816 and sits across the park from the White House. Despite that longstanding relationship, Budde says her diocese had no warning of Monday's visit. ""There was no reaching out, no sense that it would require some sort of authorization before using the church as a backdrop in that way,"" Budde told NPR's Tom Gjelten hours after the incident. The president had used the Bible, and her church, as a prop, she said. ""I was outraged that he felt that he had the license to do that, and that he would abuse our sacred symbols and our sacred space in that way,"" the bishop told Gjelten. Within hours, the White House had assembled footage of the brief outing into a triumphant video that shows the president pumping his fist as he strides past a row of riot police, culminating in him standing in front of the church. Set to swelling orchestral music, the video shows nearly no sign of the destruction and debris that days of intense protests have wrought near the White House. The president, accompanied by his daughter Ivanka, several Cabinet members and Secret Service agents, walked to St. John's a few minutes after Washington's just-installed 7 p.m. curfew began. The federal force used against the demonstrators nearly 30 minutes before the curfew began incensed Mayor Muriel Bowser. ""Shameful!"" Bowser said via Twitter, saying that after ""federal police used munitions on peaceful protestors in front of the White House,"" the city's police force's job of keeping the peace would be made more difficult. I imposed a curfew at 7pm. A full 25 minutes before the curfew & w/o provocation, federal police used munitions on peaceful protestors in front of the White House, an act that will make the job of @DCPoliceDept officers more difficult. Shameful!  DC residents — Go home. Be safe — Muriel Bowser (@MurielBowser) June 2, 2020 When the federal force rushed at protesters outside the White House, journalists were also pushed out. Officers attacked Australian reporter Amelia Brace and also hit cameraman Tim Myers, prompting Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison to call for an investigation. The scene played out on live TV, during Australia's breakfast-time Sunrise show. ""While live on air, Myers was struck in the chest by a riot shield and Brace was clubbed with a police baton,"" Australia's 7NEWS reports. ""Our Ambassador should be certainly making representations on behalf of these Australians who effectively been assaulted...for doing their job"" - Leader of the @AustralianLabor Party @AlboMP speaking after @Channel7 journalist & cameraman were hit. https://t.co/rCG56KbYRw #7NEWS pic.twitter.com/CUslYLfYes — 7NEWS Sydney (@7NewsSydney) June 2, 2020 Brace tells Australia's ABC that she repeatedly identified herself as a journalist as officers quickly closed in on them during the rush to clear a path for Trump. ""Despite that as I ran away, clearly stating that we were media, with my cameraman with a camera on his shoulders, I was hit across the back with the baton,"" she says. ""We were then fired upon by the National Guard with those rubber bullets, who are the exact people I had shown my media pass to ... and then we ended up getting tear-gassed."" The situation, she said, was ""absolutely terrifying."" ""I also managed to get a rubber bullet to the backside, and Tim got one in the back of the neck, so we'll have a few bruises tomorrow — but we're feeling perfectly safe,"" Brace says. Shock and anger over the incident led U.S. Ambassador to Australia Arthur B. Culvahouse Jr. to issue a statement saying, ""Freedom of the press is a right Australians and Americans hold dear. We take mistreatment of journalists seriously, as do all who take democracy seriously."" Trump's use of force to allow him to walk across the park has also prompted Arlington County, Va., to pull its police officers out of the nation's capital. The county had sent a police contingent to help keep peace in Washington. But it says the officers were put in a dangerous position that exposed them and others to risk ""for a purpose not worthy of our mutual aid obligations."" ""All ACPD officers left the District of Columbia at 8:30 p.m. Monday,"" Arlington County says. The church has suffered damage during the unrest in Washington against police violence, including a fire that was lit in its basement. While Budde is thankful to first responders who put out that fire, she says she wants the focus to remain on the death of George Floyd and others who have died at the hands of police. ""I want to acknowledge the loss of property, but in no way equate it with the loss of life,"" she said. ""I want to be a church that stands in solidarity with those who are making peaceful protest."" : 6/01/20 An earlier version of this Web story mistakenly said that President Trump walked to St. John's Church nearly 30 minutes before Washington's 7 p.m. curfew began. In fact, he walked there a few minutes after the curfew began.",0.0

WASHINGTON — American cities erupted in violence and destruction in a seventh straight night of unrest, with several police officers shot or run over, amid boasts and threats from President Donald Trump to send in troops to ""dominate the streets."" In New York, nonviolent protests Monday night were punctuated by people smashing shop windows near Rockefeller Center and breaching the doors of Macy's flagship store on 34th Street, littering the pavement with broken glass. An SUV plowed into a group of officers at a demonstration in Buffalo, injuring three, including a state trooper who suffered a broken leg and a shattered pelvis. Demonstrations also broke out in such places as Philadelphia, where hundreds of protesters spilled onto a highway in the heart of the city; Atlanta, where police fired tear gas at demonstrators; and Nashville, where more than 60 National Guard members put down their riot shields at the request of peaceful protesters who had gathered in front of Tennessee's Capitol to honor George Floyd. Bystander Sean Jones, who watched as people ransacked luxury stores in New York over the weekend, said: ""People are doing this so next time, before they think about trying to kill another black person, they're going to be like, 'Damn, we don't want them out here doing this ... again.'"" The unrest in Minneapolis appeared to stabilize on the same day Floyd's brother made an impassioned plea for peace at the spot where a white police officer, Derek Chauvin, put his knee on the handcuffed black man's neck until he stopped breathing last week. Chauvin has been charged with murder. Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said Tuesday that prosecutors were working as fast as they can to determine if the three other officers at the scene should be charged, too. All four have been fired. The death toll from the unrest rose to at least nine, including two people killed in a Chicago suburb. More than 5,600 people nationwide have been arrested over the past week for such offenses as stealing, blocking highways and breaking curfew, according to a count by The Associated Press. Cities struggled to keep police in line and avoid instances of excessive force. The police chief in Louisville, Kentucky, was fired after a beloved restaurant owner was killed by police and National Guard members enforcing a curfew. In Richmond, Virginia, the police chief said officers who used tear gas on a group of peaceful protesters would be disciplined. An officer was shot shortly before midnight near the Circus Circus casino in Las Vegas. Police had no immediate word on the officer's condition. Four officers were shot in St. Louis; they were expected to recover. Trump, meanwhile, portrayed himself as a hard-nosed, law-and-order president, with police under federal command using tear gas to clear peaceful demonstrators from a park near the White House so that he could walk to a church and pose with a Bible. Emerging after two days out of public view, he threatened from the White House Rose Garden to deploy ""thousands and thousands"" of U.S. troops. The photo op at the house of worship known as the Church of the Presidents was condemned by Episcopal Bishop Mariann Edgar Budde. ""The president just used a Bible and one of the churches of my diocese as a backdrop for a message antithetical to the teachings of Jesus and everything that our church stands for,"" she said. A senior White House official said Tuesday that despite Trump's threats, the goal was to pressure governors to deploy National Guard units. The president was not rushing to use the Insurrection Act to send in the military, according to the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. For nearly a week since Floyd's death, largely peaceful protests by day have turned to chaos at night. ""We have been sitting on a powder keg for some time and it has burst,"" Philadelphia Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw said. Trump warned that if governors don't deploy the National Guard in sufficient numbers to ""dominate the streets,"" the U.S. military will step in to ""quickly solve the problem for them."" ""We have the greatest country in the world,"" the president declared. ""We're going to keep it safe."" As Trump spoke, tear gas canisters could be heard exploding. A military deployment by Trump to U.S. states would mark a stunning federal intervention rarely seen in modern American history. It drew comparisons to 1968, when Richard Nixon ran as the law-and-order candidate in the aftermath of riots following the assassination of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. Trump made little effort to address the grievances of black Americans and others outraged by Floyd's death and the scourge of police brutality, undermining what his reelection campaign had hoped would be increased appeal to African American voters. Federal law allows presidents to dispatch the military into states to suppress an insurrection or if a state is defying federal law, legal experts said. But officials in New York and other states asserted that the president does not have a unilateral right to send in troops against the will of local governments.",0.0

WASHINGTON — American cities erupted in violence and destruction in a seventh straight night of unrest, with several police officers shot or run over, amid boasts and threats from President Donald Trump to send in troops to ""dominate the streets."" In New York, nonviolent protests Monday night were punctuated by people smashing shop windows near Rockefeller Center and breaching the doors of Macy's flagship store on 34th Street, littering the pavement with broken glass. An SUV plowed into a group of officers at a demonstration in Buffalo, injuring three, including a state trooper who suffered a broken leg and a shattered pelvis. Demonstrations also broke out in such places as Philadelphia, where hundreds of protesters spilled onto a highway in the heart of the city; Atlanta, where police fired tear gas at demonstrators; and Nashville, where more than 60 National Guard members put down their riot shields at the request of peaceful protesters who had gathered in front of Tennessee's Capitol to honor George Floyd. Bystander Sean Jones, who watched as people ransacked luxury stores in New York over the weekend, said: ""People are doing this so next time, before they think about trying to kill another black person, they're going to be like, 'Damn, we don't want them out here doing this ... again.'"" The unrest in Minneapolis appeared to stabilize on the same day Floyd's brother made an impassioned plea for peace at the spot where a white police officer, Derek Chauvin, put his knee on the handcuffed black man's neck until he stopped breathing last week. Chauvin has been charged with murder. Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said Tuesday that prosecutors were working as fast as they can to determine if the three other officers at the scene should be charged, too. All four have been fired. The death toll from the unrest rose to at least nine, including two people killed in a Chicago suburb. More than 5,600 people nationwide have been arrested over the past week for such offenses as stealing, blocking highways and breaking curfew, according to a count by The Associated Press. Cities struggled to keep police in line and avoid instances of excessive force. The police chief in Louisville, Kentucky, was fired after a beloved restaurant owner was killed by police and National Guard members enforcing a curfew. In Richmond, Virginia, the police chief said officers who used tear gas on a group of peaceful protesters would be disciplined. An officer was shot shortly before midnight near the Circus Circus casino in Las Vegas. Police had no immediate word on the officer's condition. Four officers were shot in St. Louis; they were expected to recover. Trump, meanwhile, portrayed himself as a hard-nosed, law-and-order president, with police under federal command using tear gas to clear peaceful demonstrators from a park near the White House so that he could walk to a church and pose with a Bible.

BIRMINGHAM, Ala. — The base of a massive Confederate monument in Alabama's largest city was all that remained Tuesday after crews dismantled the towering obelisk and trucked it away in pieces. Other symbols came down elsewhere, leaving an empty pedestal and a bare flagpole. Workers hired by the city of Birmingham began removing the top portion of the 115-year-old monument from Linn Park late Monday. By daybreak, the pedestal was the only thing left, covered with graffiti and pock marks from protests against police brutality. Sarah Collins Rudolph, whose sister Addie Mae Collins died in a racist church bombing that killed three other black girls in the city in 1963, came to see the remains. She lowered a protective face mask to take in the sight. ""I'm glad it's been removed because it has been so long. It's a hate monument,"" said Rudolph. She was seriously injured in the blast at 16th Street Baptist Church, and testified against Ku Klux Klansmen who were convicted in the killings. Confederate symbols across the South have been targeted for vandalism during demonstrations sparked by the death in police custody of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Now even some of their longtime defenders have decided to remove them. In Alexandria, Virginia, it was the United Daughters of the Confederacy that took action early Tuesday, removing the statue of a soldier gazing south from Old Town since 1889. And outside Tampa, Florida, a Sons of Confederate Veterans chapter lowered a huge Confederate battle flag that has long been flown in view of two interstate highways. Birmingham finally took action about a day after protesters tried to remove the monument themselves, during one of the many nationwide protests sparked by the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody. Live video from overnight showed a flatbed truck hauling off the stone pieces in the early morning hours. It's unclear where they were being taken. Crews were expected to return later Tuesday to finish the job, a city official said. The monument had been the subject of a protracted court battle between the city and state. Alabama authorities said Birmingham would face a $25,000 assessment for violating a state law that bans the removal of such monuments. Mayor Randall Woodfin said the fine would be much more affordable than the cost of continued unrest in the city. Work to remove the monument began on Monday, which happened to be Alabama's holiday honoring Confederate President Jefferson Davis, who was sworn in on the steps of the state Capitol in Montgomery. There, on the same day, someone knocked over a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee outside a mostly black high school named for him, news outlets reported. In Alexandria, a city spokesman said the United Daughters of the Confederacy informed the city on Monday that it would remove the statue, and the city's only role was to provide traffic support. By morning, the pedestal was all that was left. City officials were not told where the statue was taken. Titled ""Appomattox,"" it depicts a solitary Confederate soldier, his head bowed slightly. In 1890, a state law was passed barring local officials from ever removing it. That law was repealed earlier this year. Alexandria Mayor Justin Wilson tweeted photos of the removal on Tuesday, saying ""Alexandria, like all great cities, is constantly changing and evolving.""",0.0

It referenced ""tipping police cars,"" ""graffiti"" and asking people to ""take examples from riots in other cities."" The post has since been removed. Police determined the post originated from a home in Ashland and arrested Daniel Zeron, 19. He was held on preventative detention and pleaded not guilty at his arraignment Tuesday. His trial is scheduled for July 6.

It's president. Trump spoke in the Rose Garden. What happened in the city last night was a total disgrace. The president urging states to dominate the situation, calling the nation's Governors Week in a Monday conference call and going a step further during his prepared remarks. If a city or state refuses to take the actions that are necessary to defend the life and property of their residents, then I will deploy the United States military and quickly solve the problem for them. That message received immediate pushback. I say Thank you, but no, thank you. I care more about them. Then some of the noise I heard on a morning focal. Meanwhile, after protesters were cleared, the president walking across the street to ST John's Episcopal Church, which was damaged in a fire Sunday, stopping to hold up a Bible, a move condemned by church officials. I just can't believe what my eyes see tonight, Advertisement What you need to know about your rights if you're planning to take part in protests Share Shares Copy Link Copy Every American has the right to demonstrate peacefully. It's right there in the First Amendment. But it's not as simple as showing up with a sign.There are some measures officials can use to limit protests, and it's easy to accidentally tiptoe into legally murky territory if you don't know the specifics.So before you go, read up.Timothy Zick is a professor of government and citizenship at the College of William & Mary Law School. He specializes in constitutional law and the First Amendment, and he's written several books about both, including 2009's ""Speech Out of Doors: Preserving First Amendment Liberties in Public Spaces.""Emerson Sykes is a staff attorney with the ACLU's Speech, Technology and Privacy Project, who studies free speech protections under the First Amendment. Previously, he worked for Africa at the International Center for Not-for-Profit Law to protect free speech.1. What are my rights as a protester?The First Amendment gives Americans the right to assemble peacefully and air our grievances. Historically, we've relied on protests to hold power to account — think the March on Washington in 1963 for civil rights or the March for Our Lives demonstration in 2018 for gun control.The government can't stop you from peacefully protesting, but they can impose some restrictions on the time, place and manner of the protest — for example, barring protesters from walking onto a public highway or instituting a curfew that affects when protests end, Sykes said.They can't block a protest simply because of its content, though.If protests are planned in advance, organizers may obtain a permit so law enforcement can block off public spaces for them to demonstrate, Sykes said.There are protections, though, for ""spontaneous protests"" that spawn in response to current events, like the protests that spawned after George Floyd's death, he said.The First Amendment does not continue to protect protests that escalate to violence or the destruction of private or public property, he said.That's when law enforcement has the right to end them and deescalate threats of violence, he said.2. Where can and can't I protest?A slew of public spaces are OK for protests — sidewalks, city parks, streets and other public forums are usually lawful, Sykes said.Some states require you file a permit to block off streets, and the right to assembly doesn't give you the automatic right to march on a public highway, Zick said.People can be arrested or cited for blocking passage, he said.On private property, you don't have the right to assemble.Zick called it the ""no man's land"" in terms of the First Amendment, and police can move you off the property and keep you from demonstrating there.They may even have that right to move you even if you're on public property. Special rules apply to government buildings because protests may disrupt business going on inside, Sykes said.If the protest was permitted, you should be allowed to stay where you are — but leaving the permitted protest site may unintentionally lead you into prohibited places, he said.3. Can police or local leaders tell us to disperse?It depends, Sykes said: If a mayor pleads with people to go home, you have no legal obligation to comply.But police and local government can order you to leave, say, if they've imposed a curfew, as long as they give you ample notice to leave safely, Sykes said.If you stay on the street past a curfew — or if you protest on private property — you may be cited or arrested.4. What can I record?You have the right to take photos and videos of what's happening at a protest in a public place, and you can record police, too.Different states have different rules about audio recording and sharing that without the consent of the people whose voices you recorded, but the visual portion of videos and photos are always protected by the First Amendment, Sykes said.If you're interfering with legitimate police operations, they can ask you to move. It's best to videotape them from a safe distance.Police can't ask you to give them your phone or forcibly confiscate it without a search warrant, which they would've needed to obtain from a judge, he said.If they demand your phone, though, comply to avoid escalating the confrontation. Afterward, you can file a police misconduct complaint or contact the ACLU, he said.5. Someone took a picture of my face at a public protest. Is that allowed?At a public protest in the United States, you consent to a photo just by being there. Anyone who photographs you protesting in a public place may have a right to use your image, and you may see images of yourself in the media or online, Zick said.6. What should I pack to stay safe at a protest?Pack light, Sykes said. He suggests you bring water and a snack at minimum. If you bring a bag, prepare for it to be searched.In a pandemic, wearing a mask can keep you from breathing in droplets containing coronavirus. Coming within close contact of other protesters could expose you to their spit or sneezes, which may carry the coronavirus.Of course, keep an ID on your person, too.And if you fear you'll be arrested and will need legal help, memorize the number to a local or national law organization that could assist you in getting out of jail and handling your case afterward, Sykes said.7. What can — and can't — police do during a protest?It's the responsibility of police to protect your right to peaceful assembly.They're also empowered to uphold law and order, which gives them broad authority to deescalate threats of violence how they see fit.How they deescalate that violence depends on local laws and the circumstances under which they use them, which can be difficult to prove in court if you believe they used force unlawfully, Zick said.Like Sykes said, police do not have the right to search your phone or personal devices without a warrant, which only a judge can grant them.They also don't have permission to delete content from your phone, so if they tell you to delete a video you took or delete it themselves, they're in the wrong, he said.8. What can I do if a police officer stops me?Be polite. Don't resist.Ask them if you're free to go after speaking with them, Sykes said.If they say yes, calmly walk away and rejoin the protest if it's safe to.If they say no, and they detain you, don't resist and keep calm, Sykes said. Ask them what crime you're suspected of committing.9. What can I do if I get arrested?Some people get arrested intentionally as a form of civil disobedience. But whether or not you planned to get handcuffed, you shouldn't resist arrest, Sykes said.It's the best chance you have to stay safe.During your arrest, you can remain silent, as is your right, Sykes said.In some states, police are permitted to know your name if they ask, but they don't have the right to know where you're from or your citizenship status, he said.You can also ask for a lawyer — remember that number you held onto for legal support.If you're booked into jail, call a lawyer immediately, Sykes said.Police can't listen in on your call if you're phoning a lawyer, but they can listen in if you're calling a friend or family member, so be aware, he said.10. What can I do if I feel law enforcement or other officials violated my rights?You can sue for civil rights violations.You're allowed to do that under Section 1983 of federal law, which covers violations by state actors and police who violate First Amendment rights to assemble, speak and petition.Some protesters file large class-action suits that are occasionally successful, and sometimes authorities can pay damages when they decide litigation isn't worth it, Zick said.But qualified immunity can shield officers from civil liability if they didn't violate a clearly established law, he said.Qualified immunity is a legal doctrine that protects police officers accused of interfering with constitutional rights from being liable unless they violated a clearly established and defined law.The lines are blurred at protests of what police are allowed to do and what constitutes overreaching, so ""clearly established"" constitutional rights are difficult to determine, Zick said.In this way, many police officers are protected by qualified immunity, Sykes said.""Those cases are difficult to win and expensive in terms of personal time and resources,"" Zick said. ""Naturally, I think a lot of the protesters whose rights may well have been violated may not pursue cases.""11. Can my workplace fire me if they find out I attended a protest?That depends on the contract you made with your employer when you were hired, but yes, it's possible, Sykes said.You have stronger constitutional protections for what you do outside of work, but depending on what you agreed on when you were hired, a company may be able to terminate your employment, he said.",0.0

But when a black police officer responding to the crowds kneeled to show support and other officers joined, a crowd erupted into praise, prompting protesters to shake the hands of police and hug them. Protesters in Fort Worth have been noting deaths such as George Floyd, who died on Memorial Day in Minneapolis after an officer pressed his knee on his neck for more than eight minutes. The officer, who was since fired, now faces third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter charges.Crowds there also have called attention to Atatiana Jefferson, whose family said she was playing video games with her nephew when a Fort Worth officer shot her in her home in October. The officer resigned and has been indicted on a murder charge. Later Monday, police in riot gear responded to the crowds, causing confusion, but police chief Ed Kraus took a knee and prayed with people, and officers in riot gear later did, too, the Fort Worth Star-Telegram reported.""I think it's a good step,"" Kraus said.

Trump and First Lady Melania Trump traveled across town Tuesday for a brief visit to Saint John Paul II National Shrine adjacent to The Catholic University of America. The shrine is a place of prayer for Catholics but welcomes people of all faiths. The Trumps posed for photos in front of a statue of Saint Pope John Paul II outside the shrine and stood silently for a few minutes, hands clasped in front of them. They did not make remarks. Washington Archbishop Wilton D. Gregory slammed the presidential visit in a statement shortly before the Trumps' arrival. “I find it baffling that and reprehensible that any Catholic facility would allow itself to be so egregiously misused and manipulated in a fashion that violates our religious principles, which call us to defend the rights of all people even those with whom we might disagree,” Gregory said in a statement. Trump also is scheduled to sign an executive order on international religious freedom on Tuesday. Trump's visit to the shrine comes just one day after he walked across Lafayette Park next to the White House and posed for cameras outside St. John's Episcopal Church, which suffered slight damage after it was set on fire by protesters late Sunday night. Violent protests have erupted in Washington and dozens of other cities across the country following the death of George Floyd, a black man in Minneapolis who died in the custody of police. Former police officer Derrick Chauvin has been charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter in Floyd's death. Critics hammered Trump because police used tear gas and shields on protesters in Lafayette Park, essentially clearing a path for the president to walk to the historic building known as the church of presidents. The show of force came roughly half an hour before a 7 p.m. curfew was to take effect in Washington. ""Tear-gassing peaceful protesters without provocation just so that the President could pose for photos outside a church dishonors every value that faith teaches us,"" said a joint statement from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, said in a speech Tuesday in Philadelphia that the St. John's event proves Trump is ""more interested in serving the passions of his base."" ""When peaceful protesters are dispersed by the order of the president from the doorstep of the people’s house, the White House – using tear gas and flash grenades – in order to stage a photo op at a noble church, we can be forgiven for believing that the president is more interested in power than in principle,"" Biden said. Church officials protested that Trump did not call them about his plans to visit to St. John's on Monday. Mariann E. Budde, bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Washington, which includes St. John’s Episcopal Church, told CNN she was outraged by the use of tear gas to get people out of the way for a photo op. ""The president just used a Bible, the most sacred text of the Judeo-Christian tradition, and one of the churches of my diocese, without permission, as a backdrop for a message antithetical to the teachings of Jesus and everything that our churches stand for,"" she said. Bishop Gregory noted that Saint Pope John Paul II was “an ardent defender of the rights and dignity of human beings"" and ""certainly would not condone the use of tear gas and other deterrents to silence, scatter or intimidate them for a photo opportunity in front of a place of worship and peace."" White House officials said Trump did want to pay his respects to St. John's, which suffered a basement fire during protests Sunday. The president also wanted to leave the White House grounds to prove he was not “in the bunker“ because of the protesters, said one official who requested anonymity to discuss the president’s communications strategy. The president was particularly angry when word got out that the Secret Service escorted him to the bunker of the White House during protests just beyond the gates of the executive mansion on Friday, the official said. After the St. John's visit, the White House put out a statement saying protesters had been repeatedly warned to exit the park ahead of the 7 p.m. curfew. “The perimeter was expanded to help enforce the 7 p.m.curfew in the same area where rioters attempted to burn down one of our nation’s most historic churches the night before,"" spokesman Judd Deere.

In a morning tweet less than two hours before his visit to the shrine,Trump took credit for crackdowns in Washington – and Minneapolis. ""D.C. had no problems last night,"" he said. ""Many arrests. Great job done by all. Overwhelming force. Domination. Likewise, Minneapolis was great (thank you President Trump!).""

She held a sign that read ""in solidarity – RIP George Floyd – Black Lives Matter.” Warner said she hoped passing drivers would read the message and “think about the injustice done to African Americans for centuries.” Warner said she has a 49-year-old son and that her heart “hurts for moms whose sons can’t reach that age.” She called Trump’s visit to St. John’s on Monday “obscene” for the way he “poses with the Bible.” Some drivers honked in support as they passed by and shook their fists out their car windows.

Trump and First Lady Melania Trump traveled across town Tuesday for a brief visit to Saint John Paul II National Shrine adjacent to The Catholic University of America. The shrine is a place of prayer for Catholics but welcomes people of all faiths. The Trumps posed for photos in front of a statue of Saint Pope John Paul II outside the shrine and stood silently for a few minutes, hands clasped in front of them. They did not make remarks. Washington Archbishop Wilton D. Gregory slammed the presidential visit in a statement shortly before the Trumps' arrival. “I find it baffling that and reprehensible that any Catholic facility would allow itself to be so egregiously misused and manipulated in a fashion that violates our religious principles, which call us to defend the rights of all people even those with whom we might disagree,” Gregory said in a statement. Trump also is scheduled to sign an executive order on international religious freedom on Tuesday. Trump's visit to the shrine comes just one day after he walked across Lafayette Park next to the White House and posed for cameras outside St. John's Episcopal Church, which suffered slight damage after it was set on fire by protesters late Sunday night. Violent protests have erupted in Washington and dozens of other cities across the country following the death of George Floyd, a black man in Minneapolis who died in the custody of police. Former police officer Derrick Chauvin has been charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter in Floyd's death.

PARIS — Thousands of French protesters defied a virus-related police ban and rallied Tuesday against racial injustice and heavy-handed police tactics, as global outrage over what happened to George Floyd in the United States kindled frustrations across borders and continents. Clapping, cheering and waving signs reading ""Black Lives Matter"" and ""Police Everywhere, Justice Nowhere,"" the largely young, multiracial crowd streamed to the main Paris courthouse and rallied peacefully while police monitored closely from nearby corners. Earlier, thousands marched in Sydney, Australia's largest city, chanting ""I can't breathe,"" and expressions of anger erupted in multiple languages on social networks, with thousands of Swedes joining an online protest and others speaking out under the banner of #BlackOutTuesday. Diplomatic ire percolated too, with the European Union's top foreign policy official saying the bloc was ""shocked and appalled"" by Floyd's death. As protests escalated worldwide, solidarity with U.S. demonstrators increasingly mixed with local worries. ""When you refuse to treat the problem of racism ... it leads to what we see in the United States,"" said Dominique Sopo, head of French activist group SOS Racisme. ""The case of George Floyd echoes what we fear in France."" Floyd died last week after a police officer pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes even after he stopped moving and pleading for air. The death set off protests that spread across America -- and now, beyond. Fears of the coronavirus remain close to the surface and were the reason cited by the police for banning Tuesday's protest at the main Paris courthouse. Gatherings of more than 10 people remain banned in France as part of virus confinement measures. But the Paris protest plans drew attention online, and demonstrators showed up anyway. Similar demonstrations were held in other French cities in honor of Adama Traore, who died shortly after his arrest in 2016, and in solidarity with Americans demonstrating against Floyd's death. The Traore case has become emblematic of the fight against police brutality in France. The circumstances of the death of the 24-year-old Frenchman of Malian origin are still under investigation after four years of conflicting medical reports about what happened. The lawyer for two of the three police officers involved in the arrest, Rodolphe Bosselut, said the Floyd and Traore cases ""have strictly nothing to do with each other."" Bosselut told The Associated Press that Traore's death wasn't linked with the conditions of his arrest but other factors, including a pre-existing medical condition. Traore's family says he died from asphyxiation because of police tactics -- and that his last words were ""I can't breathe."" ""I can't breathe"" were also the final words of David Dungay, a 26-year-old Aboriginal man who died in a Sydney prison in 2015 while being restrained by five guards. As 3,000 people marched peacefully through Sydney, many said they had been inspired by a mixture of sympathy for African Americans amid ongoing violent protests in the U.S. and to call for change in Australia's treatment of its indigenous population, particularly involving police. The mostly Australian crowd at the authorized demonstration also included protesters from the U.S. and elsewhere. ""I'm here for my people, and for our fallen brothers and sisters around the world,"" said Sydney indigenous woman Amanda Hill, 46, who attended the rally with her daughter and two nieces. ""What's happening in America shines a light on the situation here. It doesn't matter if it's about the treatment of black men and women from here or from another country; enough is enough,"" she said. A total of 432 indigenous Australians have died in police detention since a 1991 Royal Commission — Australia's highest level of official inquiry — into Aboriginal deaths in custody, according to The Guardian newspaper. Australia has also never signed a treaty with the country's indigenous population, who suffer higher-than-average rates of infant mortality and poor health, plus shorter life expectancy and lower levels of education and employment than white Australians. Another protest was planned Tuesday in the Dutch capital The Hague, and more than 6,000 people attended a Sweden-organized online protest to express support with the Black Lives Matter movement. Among speakers was Aysha Jones, a Gambia-born and Sweden-based activist and fashion blogger. Jones said the protest was important to show support to people in America, but also to remind Swedes that racism ""does exist here, it's very real and people are being harmed from it."" More protests in various countries are planned later in the week, including a string of demonstrations in front of U.S. embassies on Saturday. The drama unfolding in the U.S. drew increasing diplomatic concern. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell's remarks in Brussels were the strongest to come out of the 27-nation bloc, saying Floyd's death was a result of an abuse of power. Borrell told reporters that ""like the people of the United States, we are shocked and appalled by the death of George Floyd."" He underlined that Europeans ""support the right to peaceful protest, and also we condemn violence and racism of any kind, and for sure, we call for a de-escalation of tensions."" German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said peaceful protests in the U.S. following Floyd's death are ""understandable and more than legitimate."" ""I can only express my hope that the peaceful protests do not continue to lead to violence, but even more express the hope that these protests have an effect in the United States,"" Maas said. More African leaders are speaking up over the killing of Floyd. ""It cannot be right that, in the 21st century, the United States, this great bastion of democracy, continues to grapple with the problem of systemic racism,"" Ghana President Nana Akufo-Addo said in a statement, adding that black people the world over are shocked and distraught. Kenyan opposition leader and former Prime Minister Raila Odinga offered a prayer for the U.S., ""that there be justice and freedom for all human beings who call America their country."" Like some in Africa who have spoken out, Odinga also noted troubles at home, saying the judging of people by character instead of skin color ""is a dream we in Africa, too, owe our citizens.""",0.0

Leading the event were Palana Belken, Rochester City Councilor, and Emmett Soldati, owner of Teatotaller cafe in Somersworth and candidate for the New Hampshire Executive Council District 2 seat. The event was attended by Pride event organizers across the state, GLSEN, Stonewall Democrats, several drag performers and elected leaders, among others, according to organizers. The agenda began with a moment of silence for social justice and Black Lives Matter and proceeded to a “Pride Roll Call” - an opportunity for leaders of Pride organizations to each talk about how they are planning to celebrate Pride amid the coronavirus pandemic. Palana said, “The biggest takeaway from this call was that people were talking about the need for statewide activation beyond what each community is doing.” Soldait said, “In Massachusetts and Maine for example, there are statewide Pride organizations but unfortunately that does not exist in New Hampshire. The silver lining here is that because of COVID and the fact that we are meeting in a Pride Town Hall on Zoom, we are connecting with people from Claremont and Conway and elsewhere who we might not have met in our own bubble.

PARIS — Thousands of French protesters defied a virus-related police ban and rallied Tuesday against racial injustice and heavy-handed police tactics, as global outrage over what happened to George Floyd in the United States kindled frustrations across borders and continents. Clapping, cheering and waving signs reading ""Black Lives Matter"" and ""Police Everywhere, Justice Nowhere,"" the largely young, multiracial crowd streamed to the main Paris courthouse and rallied peacefully while police monitored closely from nearby corners. Earlier, thousands marched in Sydney, Australia's largest city, chanting ""I can't breathe,"" and expressions of anger erupted in multiple languages on social networks, with thousands of Swedes joining an online protest and others speaking out under the banner of #BlackOutTuesday. Diplomatic ire percolated too, with the European Union's top foreign policy official saying the bloc was ""shocked and appalled"" by Floyd's death. As protests escalated worldwide, solidarity with U.S. demonstrators increasingly mixed with local worries. ""When you refuse to treat the problem of racism ... it leads to what we see in the United States,"" said Dominique Sopo, head of French activist group SOS Racisme. ""The case of George Floyd echoes what we fear in France."" Floyd died last week after a police officer pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes even after he stopped moving and pleading for air. The death set off protests that spread across America -- and now, beyond. Fears of the coronavirus remain close to the surface and were the reason cited by the police for banning Tuesday's protest at the main Paris courthouse. Gatherings of more than 10 people remain banned in France as part of virus confinement measures. But the Paris protest plans drew attention online, and demonstrators showed up anyway. Similar demonstrations were held in other French cities in honor of Adama Traore, who died shortly after his arrest in 2016, and in solidarity with Americans demonstrating against Floyd's death. The Traore case has become emblematic of the fight against police brutality in France. The circumstances of the death of the 24-year-old Frenchman of Malian origin are still under investigation after four years of conflicting medical reports about what happened. The lawyer for two of the three police officers involved in the arrest, Rodolphe Bosselut, said the Floyd and Traore cases ""have strictly nothing to do with each other."" Bosselut told The Associated Press that Traore's death wasn't linked with the conditions of his arrest but other factors, including a pre-existing medical condition. Traore's family says he died from asphyxiation because of police tactics -- and that his last words were ""I can't breathe."" ""I can't breathe"" were also the final words of David Dungay, a 26-year-old Aboriginal man who died in a Sydney prison in 2015 while being restrained by five guards. As 3,000 people marched peacefully through Sydney, many said they had been inspired by a mixture of sympathy for African Americans amid ongoing violent protests in the U.S. and to call for change in Australia's treatment of its indigenous population, particularly involving police. The mostly Australian crowd at the authorized demonstration also included protesters from the U.S. and elsewhere. ""I'm here for my people, and for our fallen brothers and sisters around the world,"" said Sydney indigenous woman Amanda Hill, 46, who attended the rally with her daughter and two nieces. ""What's happening in America shines a light on the situation here. It doesn't matter if it's about the treatment of black men and women from here or from another country; enough is enough,"" she said. A total of 432 indigenous Australians have died in police detention since a 1991 Royal Commission — Australia's highest level of official inquiry — into Aboriginal deaths in custody, according to The Guardian newspaper. Australia has also never signed a treaty with the country's indigenous population, who suffer higher-than-average rates of infant mortality and poor health, plus shorter life expectancy and lower levels of education and employment than white Australians. Another protest was planned Tuesday in the Dutch capital The Hague, and more than 6,000 people attended a Sweden-organized online protest to express support with the Black Lives Matter movement. Among speakers was Aysha Jones, a Gambia-born and Sweden-based activist and fashion blogger. Jones said the protest was important to show support to people in America, but also to remind Swedes that racism ""does exist here, it's very real and people are being harmed from it."" More protests in various countries are planned later in the week, including a string of demonstrations in front of U.S. embassies on Saturday. The drama unfolding in the U.S. drew increasing diplomatic concern. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell's remarks in Brussels were the strongest to come out of the 27-nation bloc, saying Floyd's death was a result of an abuse of power. Borrell told reporters that ""like the people of the United States, we are shocked and appalled by the death of George Floyd."" He underlined that Europeans ""support the right to peaceful protest, and also we condemn violence and racism of any kind, and for sure, we call for a de-escalation of tensions."" German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said peaceful protests in the U.S. following Floyd's death are ""understandable and more than legitimate."" ""I can only express my hope that the peaceful protests do not continue to lead to violence, but even more express the hope that these protests have an effect in the United States,"" Maas said. More African leaders are speaking up over the killing of Floyd. ""It cannot be right that, in the 21st century, the United States, this great bastion of democracy, continues to grapple with the problem of systemic racism,"" Ghana President Nana Akufo-Addo said in a statement, adding that black people the world over are shocked and distraught. Kenyan opposition leader and former Prime Minister Raila Odinga offered a prayer for the U.S., ""that there be justice and freedom for all human beings who call America their country."" Like some in Africa who have spoken out, Odinga also noted troubles at home, saying the judging of people by character instead of skin color ""is a dream we in Africa, too, owe our citizens.""",0.0

Trump and First Lady Melania Trump traveled across town Tuesday for a brief visit to Saint John Paul II National Shrine adjacent to The Catholic University of America. The shrine is a place of prayer for Catholics but welcomes people of all faiths. The Trumps posed for photos in front of a statue of Saint Pope John Paul II outside the shrine and stood silently for a few minutes, hands clasped in front of them. They did not make remarks. Washington Archbishop Wilton D. Gregory slammed the presidential visit in a statement shortly before the Trumps' arrival. “I find it baffling that and reprehensible that any Catholic facility would allow itself to be so egregiously misused and manipulated in a fashion that violates our religious principles, which call us to defend the rights of all people even those with whom we might disagree,” Gregory said in a statement. Trump also is scheduled to sign an executive order on international religious freedom on Tuesday. Trump's visit to the shrine comes just one day after he walked across Lafayette Park next to the White House and posed for cameras outside St. John's Episcopal Church, which suffered slight damage after it was set on fire by protesters late Sunday night. Violent protests have erupted in Washington and dozens of other cities across the country following the death of George Floyd, a black man in Minneapolis who died in the custody of police. Former police officer Derrick Chauvin has been charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter in Floyd's death. Critics hammered Trump because police used tear gas and shields on protesters in Lafayette Park, essentially clearing a path for the president to walk to the historic building known as the church of presidents. The show of force came roughly half an hour before a 7 p.m. curfew was to take effect in Washington. ""Tear-gassing peaceful protesters without provocation just so that the President could pose for photos outside a church dishonors every value that faith teaches us,"" said a joint statement from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, said in a speech Tuesday in Philadelphia that the St. John's event proves Trump is ""more interested in serving the passions of his base."" ""When peaceful protesters are dispersed by the order of the president from the doorstep of the people’s house, the White House – using tear gas and flash grenades – in order to stage a photo op at a noble church, we can be forgiven for believing that the president is more interested in power than in principle,"" Biden said. Church officials protested that Trump did not call them about his plans to visit to St. John's on Monday. Mariann E. Budde, bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Washington, which includes St. John’s Episcopal Church, told CNN she was outraged by the use of tear gas to get people out of the way for a photo op. ""The president just used a Bible, the most sacred text of the Judeo-Christian tradition, and one of the churches of my diocese, without permission, as a backdrop for a message antithetical to the teachings of Jesus and everything that our churches stand for,"" she said. Bishop Gregory noted that Saint Pope John Paul II was “an ardent defender of the rights and dignity of human beings"" and ""certainly would not condone the use of tear gas and other deterrents to silence, scatter or intimidate them for a photo opportunity in front of a place of worship and peace."" White House officials said Trump did want to pay his respects to St. John's, which suffered a basement fire during protests Sunday. The president also wanted to leave the White House grounds to prove he was not “in the bunker“ because of the protesters, said one official who requested anonymity to discuss the president’s communications strategy. The president was particularly angry when word got out that the Secret Service escorted him to the bunker of the White House during protests just beyond the gates of the executive mansion on Friday, the official said. After the St. John's visit, the White House put out a statement saying protesters had been repeatedly warned to exit the park ahead of the 7 p.m. curfew. “The perimeter was expanded to help enforce the 7 p.m.curfew in the same area where rioters attempted to burn down one of our nation’s most historic churches the night before,"" spokesman Judd Deere. ""Protesters were given three warnings by the U.S. Park Police."" In a morning tweet less than two hours before his visit to the shrine,Trump took credit for crackdowns in Washington – and Minneapolis. ""D.C. had no problems last night,"" he said. ""Many arrests. Great job done by all. Overwhelming force. Domination. Likewise, Minneapolis was great (thank you President Trump!)."" A couple hundred peaceful protesters gathered down the street from the national shrine ahead of Trump’s arrival, holding up signs and chanting ""no justice, no peace"" and ""black lives matter."" Police on the scene wore baseball caps and vests, but not riot gear. As Trump's motorcade arrived, some protesters shouted expletives, and others raised their middle finger. Kathy Warner, a 77-year-old retired teacher, said she was there to honor Floyd’s memory and to protest the president. She held a sign that read ""in solidarity – RIP George Floyd – Black Lives Matter.” Warner said she hoped passing drivers would read the message and “think about the injustice done to African Americans for centuries.” Warner said she has a 49-year-old son and that her heart “hurts for moms whose sons can’t reach that age.” She called Trump’s visit to St. John’s on Monday “obscene” for the way he “poses with the Bible.” Some drivers honked in support as they passed by and shook their fists out their car windows. The shrine to the late Pope John Paul II sits on the site of the former John Paul II Cultural Center, which the Knights of Columbus bought in 2011. The lay Catholic organization established it as a shrine to John Paul and added a permanent museum exhibit about his life. Daily masses are held at the shrine, which is a destination for Catholic pilgrims. The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops declared it a national shrine on March 14, 2014, after John Paul was canonized as a saint. ""It is meant to be a place of genuine encounter with God that leads to a renewal of individuals, families, societies, and cultures,"" reads the shrine's official website, adding it is a place where God ""heals and renews every dimension of human life.""

In a morning tweet less than two hours before his visit to the shrine,Trump took credit for crackdowns in Washington – and Minneapolis. ""D.C. had no problems last night,"" he said. ""Many arrests. Great job done by all. Overwhelming force. Domination. Likewise, Minneapolis was great (thank you President Trump!)."" A couple hundred peaceful protesters gathered down the street from the national shrine ahead of Trump’s arrival, holding up signs and chanting ""no justice, no peace"" and ""black lives matter."" Police on the scene wore baseball caps and vests, but not riot gear. As Trump's motorcade arrived, some protesters shouted expletives, and others raised their middle finger. Kathy Warner, a 77-year-old retired teacher, said she was there to honor Floyd’s memory and to protest the president. She held a sign that read ""in solidarity – RIP George Floyd – Black Lives Matter.” Warner said she hoped passing drivers would read the message and “think about the injustice done to African Americans for centuries.” Warner said she has a 49-year-old son and that her heart “hurts for moms whose sons can’t reach that age.” She called Trump’s visit to St. John’s on Monday “obscene” for the way he “poses with the Bible.” Some drivers honked in support as they passed by and shook their fists out their car windows. The shrine to the late Pope John Paul II sits on the site of the former John Paul II Cultural Center, which the Knights of Columbus bought in 2011. The lay Catholic organization established it as a shrine to John Paul and added a permanent museum exhibit about his life. Daily masses are held at the shrine, which is a destination for Catholic pilgrims. The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops declared it a national shrine on March 14, 2014, after John Paul was canonized as a saint. ""It is meant to be a place of genuine encounter with God that leads to a renewal of individuals, families, societies, and cultures,"" reads the shrine's official website, adding it is a place where God ""heals and renews every dimension of human life.""

PARIS — Thousands of French protesters defied a virus-related police ban and rallied Tuesday against racial injustice and heavy-handed police tactics, as global outrage over what happened to George Floyd in the United States kindled frustrations across borders and continents. Clapping, cheering and waving signs reading ""Black Lives Matter"" and ""Police Everywhere, Justice Nowhere,"" the largely young, multiracial crowd streamed to the main Paris courthouse and rallied peacefully while police monitored closely from nearby corners. Earlier, thousands marched in Sydney, Australia's largest city, chanting ""I can't breathe,"" and expressions of anger erupted in multiple languages on social networks, with thousands of Swedes joining an online protest and others speaking out under the banner of #BlackOutTuesday. Diplomatic ire percolated too, with the European Union's top foreign policy official saying the bloc was ""shocked and appalled"" by Floyd's death. As protests escalated worldwide, solidarity with U.S. demonstrators increasingly mixed with local worries. ""When you refuse to treat the problem of racism ... it leads to what we see in the United States,"" said Dominique Sopo, head of French activist group SOS Racisme. ""The case of George Floyd echoes what we fear in France."" Floyd died last week after a police officer pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes even after he stopped moving and pleading for air. The death set off protests that spread across America -- and now, beyond. Fears of the coronavirus remain close to the surface and were the reason cited by the police for banning Tuesday's protest at the main Paris courthouse. Gatherings of more than 10 people remain banned in France as part of virus confinement measures. But the Paris protest plans drew attention online, and demonstrators showed up anyway. Similar demonstrations were held in other French cities in honor of Adama Traore, who died shortly after his arrest in 2016, and in solidarity with Americans demonstrating against Floyd's death. The Traore case has become emblematic of the fight against police brutality in France. The circumstances of the death of the 24-year-old Frenchman of Malian origin are still under investigation after four years of conflicting medical reports about what happened. The lawyer for two of the three police officers involved in the arrest, Rodolphe Bosselut, said the Floyd and Traore cases ""have strictly nothing to do with each other."" Bosselut told The Associated Press that Traore's death wasn't linked with the conditions of his arrest but other factors, including a pre-existing medical condition. Traore's family says he died from asphyxiation because of police tactics -- and that his last words were ""I can't breathe."" ""I can't breathe"" were also the final words of David Dungay, a 26-year-old Aboriginal man who died in a Sydney prison in 2015 while being restrained by five guards. As 3,000 people marched peacefully through Sydney, many said they had been inspired by a mixture of sympathy for African Americans amid ongoing violent protests in the U.S. and to call for change in Australia's treatment of its indigenous population, particularly involving police. The mostly Australian crowd at the authorized demonstration also included protesters from the U.S. and elsewhere. ""I'm here for my people, and for our fallen brothers and sisters around the world,"" said Sydney indigenous woman Amanda Hill, 46, who attended the rally with her daughter and two nieces. ""What's happening in America shines a light on the situation here. It doesn't matter if it's about the treatment of black men and women from here or from another country; enough is enough,"" she said. A total of 432 indigenous Australians have died in police detention since a 1991 Royal Commission — Australia's highest level of official inquiry — into Aboriginal deaths in custody, according to The Guardian newspaper. Australia has also never signed a treaty with the country's indigenous population, who suffer higher-than-average rates of infant mortality and poor health, plus shorter life expectancy and lower levels of education and employment than white Australians. Another protest was planned Tuesday in the Dutch capital The Hague, and more than 6,000 people attended a Sweden-organized online protest to express support with the Black Lives Matter movement. Among speakers was Aysha Jones, a Gambia-born and Sweden-based activist and fashion blogger. Jones said the protest was important to show support to people in America, but also to remind Swedes that racism ""does exist here, it's very real and people are being harmed from it."" More protests in various countries are planned later in the week, including a string of demonstrations in front of U.S. embassies on Saturday. The drama unfolding in the U.S. drew increasing diplomatic concern. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell's remarks in Brussels were the strongest to come out of the 27-nation bloc, saying Floyd's death was a result of an abuse of power. Borrell told reporters that ""like the people of the United States, we are shocked and appalled by the death of George Floyd."" He underlined that Europeans ""support the right to peaceful protest, and also we condemn violence and racism of any kind, and for sure, we call for a de-escalation of tensions."" German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said peaceful protests in the U.S. following Floyd's death are ""understandable and more than legitimate."" ""I can only express my hope that the peaceful protests do not continue to lead to violence, but even more express the hope that these protests have an effect in the United States,"" Maas said. More African leaders are speaking up over the killing of Floyd. ""It cannot be right that, in the 21st century, the United States, this great bastion of democracy, continues to grapple with the problem of systemic racism,"" Ghana President Nana Akufo-Addo said in a statement, adding that black people the world over are shocked and distraught. Kenyan opposition leader and former Prime Minister Raila Odinga offered a prayer for the U.S., ""that there be justice and freedom for all human beings who call America their country."" Like some in Africa who have spoken out, Odinga also noted troubles at home, saying the judging of people by character instead of skin color ""is a dream we in Africa, too, owe our citizens.""",0.0

Leading the event were Palana Belken, Rochester City Councilor, and Emmett Soldati, owner of Teatotaller cafe in Somersworth and candidate for the New Hampshire Executive Council District 2 seat. The event was attended by Pride event organizers across the state, GLSEN, Stonewall Democrats, several drag performers and elected leaders, among others, according to organizers. The agenda began with a moment of silence for social justice and Black Lives Matter and proceeded to a “Pride Roll Call” - an opportunity for leaders of Pride organizations to each talk about how they are planning to celebrate Pride amid the coronavirus pandemic. Palana said, “The biggest takeaway from this call was that people were talking about the need for statewide activation beyond what each community is doing.” Soldait said, “In Massachusetts and Maine for example, there are statewide Pride organizations but unfortunately that does not exist in New Hampshire. The silver lining here is that because of COVID and the fact that we are meeting in a Pride Town Hall on Zoom, we are connecting with people from Claremont and Conway and elsewhere who we might not have met in our own bubble. As a result, we can see the goal of using Pride Town Hall and this technology to build the infrastructure for statewide planning.” Soldait announced the launch of his LGBTQ+ Coalition to advise his campaign and amplify LGBTQ+ concerns. More than 25 leaders, activists and performers from across the state have thus far announced their participation in the coalition, which will be chaired by Belken. Belken explained the idea behind the unique Town Hall. “As we discussed the topic of how will each of us observe Pride Month this year, we reflected on how LGBTQ Pride celebrations have come a long way, from their origins as a riot against anti-LGBTQ ordinances and police abuse at the Stonewall Inn, to a worldwide celebration of the progress made in the 51 years since,” Belken said. “There were six Pride festivals scheduled to take place across New Hampshire this month - but with large gatherings on hold for the time being, we felt it urgent to gather folks from across the state to hold space together and share how we'll each be rising to the occasion for Pride 2020.”",0.0

In his role as coach, Stevens has witnessed Brown go from a 19 year old drafted after one season playing in college to 20-point scorer in the NBA. Off the court, Stevens has seen Brown become a leader who is unafraid of using his voice to address important issues in society. So when Brown told his coach last Thursday that he was going to drive to Atlanta and help lead a Sunday protest over the killing of George Floyd, Stevens was hardly surprised. “Jaylen’s greatest impact, as good as he is at basketball, won’t be in basketball,’’ said Stevens during a Wednesday morning video conference with the media. “I just think he’s a special guy. He’s a special leader. He’s smart, but he has courage. He’s got a lot of great stuff to him. “I think we recognized that when we drafted him, but he has been even more unbelievable every day, every year. I’ve always personally really enjoyed listening to him and talking to him about things outside of basketball. He told me he was going down there on Thursday and I certainly am not surprised by him taking a leadership role. That’s who he is.’’ Brown was joined by Indiana Pacers guard Malcolm Brogdon at the rally in Atlanta, not far from Brown’s hometown of Marietta, Georgia. After driving 15 hours from Boston to Atlanta, Brown marched in a large crowd to protest the death of Floyd, who died having his neck pinned to the ground by the knee of Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin. While Brown was in Georgia, teammates Marcus Smart, Enes Kanter and Vincent Poirier were in Boston participating in a protest. “I don’t think it’s a great surprise that our guys are able to lead with such great courage,’’ said Stevens, “because they put themselves out there every day in kind of a meaningless game when you think about it. “I’ve said this many times. I think the NBA’s amazing and I think our players are amazing. We’re lucky that we have such great people representing us with the Celtics. I couldn’t be more proud to be in the NBA, to be with the Celtics and be surrounded by the people I get to go to work with every day.’’ The NBA is getting close to making plans to restart the season, perhaps in late July, and Celtics players started showing up at the Auerbach Center Monday for voluntary workouts. But Stevens said the focus is not on basketball with everything that is going on in the country, including the protests and the violence that has erupted after the death of Floyd. Stevens said that he wrote to his players over the weekend. “Extreme sadness,’’ said Stevens. “A lot of people feel the pain and it transfers to anger. I wrote a letter to our guys this weekend. It took me a while to put down exactly what I wanted to say. “I think the thing I wanted them to know is that every decent person is hurting. Every decent person feels the pain of the African-American community. But I also don’t want to pretend I know the exact distinct pain. What I wanted them to know is I’m with them.’’ There are 11 African-American players on the Celtics’ 15-man roster, and Stevens said that he knows the responsibility he has in these difficult times. “We were on a coaches call with all 30 coaches the other day,’’ said Stevens. “One thing I heard from a number of coaches was that as white coaches, we have a lot of responsibility here. “We may not be able to know the depth of the pain of our colleagues that are black, or our players that are black, our assistants that our black. But we have a responsibility to be not only empathetic but help drive change. “We have all been in these conversations before and you’re moved to drive change and sometimes actionable steps lead to what you think is progress but this sure doesn’t look like progress.’’ Stevens said that he sat in meetings with Celtics players four years ago when NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick was kneeling during the national anthem to protest social injustice. “From those three weeks of training camp, being able to sit in those meetings, being able to listen to our guys, I think that gave me a whole new understanding of just how much change is needed,’’ said Stevens. “At that time as an organization, we tried to make sure we were trying to do our part to create actionable steps.

It's a primary election date that was already going to be a challenge for election officials due to health concerns, even before nationwide unrest led to curfew orders in conflict with polling place hours in some places. In Washington, D.C., as well as the eight states voting Tuesday, the vast majority of ballots are expected to be mailed in. In Montana, for instance, election officials mailed every active registered voter a ballot. But the in-person voting options that are also required to be offered in many places create a unique problem. In Philadelphia, for instance, officials are trying to reassure voters they won't be arrested for voting in the Pennsylvania primary if the city decides to extend a 6 p.m. curfew to Tuesday. Polling places will stay open in the city until 8 p.m. ""Philly residents will not be arrested or prosecuted for going to or coming from voting tomorrow,"" District Attorney Larry Krasner told NPR member station WHYY on Monday. ""No curfew is going to interfere with any voter going to the polls. Please do not let these circumstances dissuade you."" Similarly, the District of Columbia's Board of Elections announced that vote centers, which are scheduled to be open until 8 p.m., would not be affected by a 7 p.m. curfew order in the city. ""Voters at Vote Centers and election workers are permitted to be at Vote Centers at 7, and are allowed a reasonable amount of time to get home,"" the board tweeted Monday evening. Across the country, jurisdictions are also having to adjust their in-person voting options to reduce health risks and accommodate massive poll worker shortages. The District is maintaining 20 polling places as a result of the pandemic, as opposed to its usual 144, and Philadelphia is also offering about a fifth of its normal locations. In Rhode Island, election officials are providing voters with ""one-time use stylus/pen combination devices"" to check in on electronic machines, and vote on paper. The secretary of state's office issued a seven-page report detailing how precincts should be organized and cleaned. Beyond the logistical concerns, the next question is simply whether people will be motivated to vote despite the obstacles, especially now that the Democratic presidential primary is all but wrapped up. ""We really are in uncharted territory for voting in America,"" Marcia Johnson-Blanco, co-director of the Voting Rights Project with the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, said on a call with reporters Tuesday. ""We won't know the impact of the challenges we're facing until much later."" Her organization runs a hotline (866-OUR-VOTE) that voters can call with questions or issues, and she said they received almost 3,000 calls in the past week. On Tuesday, the organization has fielded calls about Indiana voters facing long lines in Indianapolis, Maryland voters who say they did not receive their absentee ballots on time, and Pennsylvania voters confused by precinct changes. Johnson-Blanco called it the ""first super Tuesday of the COVID era,"" and she said that any problems encountered could be clues to issues that should be expected to sprout up again in the general election in November.

Daniel Zeron was detained early Tuesday morning, according to Manchester police, after he allegedly made the social media post from inside of a house in Ashland. The Facebook post, which has since been taken down, allegedly called for protesters to march along South Willow Street in Manchester and “take examples from riots in other cities,” according to court documents. “Police cars will be tipped. Graffiti is welcome,” read the post, which was shared by 25 users on the social media platform. According to a criminal complaint, Zeron, who is living at a friend’s house in Ashland, told law enforcement that the “Facebook post and event was a joke” and that he thought he had deleted it. Zeron was arraigned on misdemeanor charges and is currently being held without bail, pending a hearing scheduled for Wednesday morning. “We cannot and will not tolerate any suggested riots or acts of violence against our community,” Manchester Police Chief Carlo Capano said in a statement. It isn’t clear if law enforcement are investigating other social media activity in New Hampshire related to protests that have sprung up nationwide following the death of George Floyd at the hands of the Minneapolis police. Over the weekend, hundreds of protestors gathered in Manchester to voice their frustration over police brutality and the deaths of people of color while in police custody. While the march on Saturday was peaceful, two men were arrested and charged with felony riot and criminal threatening after allegedly displaying a gun and engaging in a verbal dispute with protestors. On Monday, Manchester Mayor Joyce Craig said her office was aware of social media posts from people outside of the city “who plan to take advantage of the pain people across the country are feeling due to the killings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery and so many others. We're working with our federal and state partners to ensure the safety of our community and the safety of those peacefully protesting.”",0.0

Antifa, short for anti-fascists, describes a broad, loosely-organized group of people whose political beliefs lean toward the left — often the far-left — but do not conform with the Democratic Party platform.Video: President Trump speaks out Monday about violenceAntifa positions can be hard to define, but many people espousing those beliefs support oppressed populations and protest the amassing of wealth by corporations and elites. Some employ radical or militant tactics to get out their messages.The fake account, @ANTIFA_US, tweeted Sunday, ""ALERT Tonight's the night, Comrades Tonight we say ""F*** The City"" and we move into the residential areas... the white hoods.... and we take what's ours #BlacklivesMaters #F***America.""Twitter said that the account was in fact linked to Identity Evropa, a white power fraternity.Though Twitter referred to the group as Identity Evropa when discussing the account's removal, the Anti Defamation League (ADL) states that the group dissolved and reformed under the name the American Identitarian Movement, which it also calls a white supremacist group.The group promotes itself as ""identitarian,"" that white people should preserve their racial and cultural identity. The American Identitarian Movement says it prohibits violence and illegal activity.CNN has reached out to the group for comment.Twitter said it had shut down other fake accounts linked to Identity Evropa, too.The phenomenon of people on the right creating fake Antifa accounts predates the current wave of protests. The takedown Monday is not the first time a fake Antifa account linked to white supremacists has been suspended by Twitter, the spokesperson confirmed.",0.0

General Buldoc is running against Bryant “Corky” Messner in a Republican Party primary on September 8, 2020. The winner of the primary election would then square off against Democrat incumbent Senator Jeanne Shaheen on November 3, 2020. General Buldoc enlisted in the US Army at age eighteen and rose through the ranks to Brigadier General. After 36 years of service, including 10 tours of duty in Afghanistan, five Bronze Stars and two Purple Hearts, Don Buldoc retired in 2017. General Buldoc has degrees in criminal justice, sociology, strategic studies, and business technology. The tragic death of George Floyd has been a flashpoint for protests throughout the nation which have frequently resulted in violence and destruction of property. Drawing on his experiences in war torn areas of Africa and Afghanistan, General Buldoc sees these events as an opportunity to bring this nation together. He calls on our national leaders to put aside their differences and to work together. Although he pledges his loyalty to President Trump, General Buldoc would have respectfully disagreed with the tactics and techniques which were used yesterday to disperse peaceful protestors near the White House. Tear gas was used to break up a peaceful assembly, so the President could pose for a photo op outside St. John’s Church with a Bible. General Buldoc strongly believes that these problems are best handled on local level. The governors of each state can best decide how to use local and state police and National Guard Forces in these situations. Federal troops should only be used in an extreme loss of order. The last part interview addresses the need for a national discussion about police brutality, racism, economic uncertainty, and the existence of a two-tier legal system. Frustration caused by these social inequities have fueled the protests which have been sparked by George Floyd’s death. General Buldoc believes that these problems are better solved on a local level. Based on his experiences with nation building in Africa and Afghanistan, General Buldoc says, “Bottom up works better than top down…the national level should be providing unity, a message of cooperation and coordination. If communities need help, you give them the help, but you stay out of their damned way.”",0.0

AP President Donald Trump may be uniquely bad at bringing a wounded, divided country together. Throughout six consecutive days of unrest in cities across the country, triggered by the death of George Floyd, an unarmed black man, in the custody a Minneapolis police officer who knelt on Floyd’s neck for nearly nine minutes – Trump pledged military retribution on protesters engaged in unlawful acts, dismissed their outrage as the work of leftist troublemakers, and said nothing of reports of heavy-handed police actions during the demonstrations. And all this comes at a time when Americans are reeling from an epochal economic collapse and the toll of the coronavirus pandemic. “President Trump has spewed division with ill-chosen tweets about looting and ‘shooting’ or ‘vicious dogs’ and overpowering weapons,” wrote my colleague Dan Balz. “He has attacked Democratic leaders as their communities burn. He flails rather than leads, his instincts all wrong for what confronts the country.” “Trump makes little disguise of conjuring a pre-civil rights America where white males held uncontested sway,” wrote Edward Luce of the Financial Times. “He will blame [former president Barack] Obama, China, radical leftists and ‘thugs’ for America’s unhappy condition – anybody, in other words, but himself.” Under Trump, the United States has already scaled back its defense of human rights and the rule of law in other parts of the world. Now the events of the past week have unfurled like the kind of catalogue of abuses you’d see documented by U.S.-based rights groups in countries elsewhere: Journalists and protesters blinded and maimed by local police? Check. A demagogic leader stirring rage against the free press? Check. Security forces targeting unarmed demonstrators with seeming impunity and even ramming their vehicles into crowds? Check and, yes, check. The rest of the world is paying attention. Black Lives Matter protests sprung up in cities including London, Berlin and Toronto. Thousands marched through Trafalgar Square. In soccer matches held in empty stadiums in Germany, some star athletes demonstrated in solidarity with George Floyd and other black victims of police brutality in the United States. In Lebanon, where mass anti-government protests have rocked Beirut and other cities, the top trending hashtag on social media shifted to acknowledge the American uprisings thousands of miles away. America’s putative foreign adversaries also are watching. “This incident is far from the first in a series of lawless conduct and unjustified violence from U.S. law enforcement,” the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement, adding to the Kremlin’s long history of pointing to human rights abuses in the United States. “American police commit such high-profile crimes all too often.” Officials in Iran did the same, calling out racial injustice in America. “If you’re dark-skinned walking in the US, you can’t be sure you’ll be alive in the next few minutes,” read a tweet from an account associated with Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran’s supreme leader, which was accompanied by a video that detailed the horrific history of slavery in the United States. And then there was China. Already locked in a spiraling geopolitical confrontation with Washington, officials in Beijing seized on the protests to push back against the Trump administration’s assertive messaging on Hong Kong, a city whose unique autonomy is being dramatically curtailed by China. Hua Chunying, chief spokesperson of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, responded on Twitter to a message of support for Hong Kong from her State Department counterpart Morgan Ortagus with the phrase “I can’t breathe” – the dying words of multiple unarmed black men put in chokeholds by U.S. police officers that has become a global protest slogan. “There are different reasons for the riots, but their similarities are overwhelming: they all defy the law, subvert order, and are destructive,” Hu Xijin, the nationalist editor of the Global Times, a state-affiliated newspaper, said in a tweeted video, in which he applauded Beijing’s “restraint” for not cheering the protests the way Washington celebrated Hong Kong’s demonstrations. This is all very convenient for China’s leadership. “The timing of the current unrest in the United States could not be better for China’s purposes,” wrote my colleague Anna Fifield. “It is not China’s rise that is scary, the authorities are saying between the lines, but the United States’ decline. It also feeds into the prevailing view in Beijing that all of the Trump administration’s actions are designed to stop China’s rejuvenation and its elevation to what it sees as its rightful place at the top of the global hierarchy.” In Washington, Trump officials waded into the propaganda battle. “The difference between our country and many of the authoritarian countries out there, when something like this happens, we investigate it,” national security adviser Robert C. O’Brien said Sunday during an appearance on ABC’s This Week. “Our people protest. They petition their government for redress. And we stand with the protesters.” But in the same conversation, O’Brien denounced the radical elements and outside agitators fomenting trouble during the protests – a script that would be familiar to anyone who has listened to pro-Beijing talking points over the past year of demonstrations in Hong Kong. For months, the Western media, as well as U.S. officials, pointed to the heavy-handedness of local security forces in Hong Kong as one of the main factors that drove the protests. As scenes of police officers brutalizing protesters and journalists flood social media in the United States, there’s no chance Trump or his allies would see matters in that same frame. Trump’s stance here is not that different from the cynical autocrats O’Brien sets the United States against. It isn’t anchored in any principled defense of private property: Trump, after all, celebrated the destructive “yellow vest” protests in France – where anti-establishment demonstrators repeatedly ransacked and vandalized sections of Paris, initially in anger over a proposed carbon tax – because it allowed him to grandstand against French President Emmanuel Macron’s climate activism. And like Beijing’s dismissal of the concerns of Hong Kong’s protesters, incensed about the threat to their political freedoms, Trump has shown little empathy for the deep-seated grievances of Americans rising up against systemic racism. “What the country needs and wants from the president, they’re not going to get,” Al Cardenas, a Florida-based Republican strategist and a former chairman of the American Conservative Union, told my colleagues. “This president, I don’t believe, relates to the racism, relates to the pain. At least I haven’t seen it.”",0.0

I do not condone violence as an individual,” Sullivan said, but the right to protest is “one of the cornerstones of our democracy. It is what makes America stand out in comparison to some other countries around the world where protests and demonstration is not allowed. It is important to remember that that is part of our democracy,” Sullivan said. “I think its important to remember how we got here and why we are here,” she said “It is important for us to understand where the violence, where the rage is coming from. It is the result of generations of a knee on the neck… that knee really is symbolic for so many of us in the black community and so many of us who have been in the civil rights movement for decades in that we’ve been fighting against knees on the neck in our education system, in our public health system, in our criminal justice system, in our economic system for so very long.” “George Floyd’s murder really is, in so many ways, emblematic of what is happening across cities in this nation every day.” Sullivan said the protests ask the question of how we get to justice at this moment. “Justice is more than the charging and convicting of the Minneapolis four. Justice is reflected in our policy on the ground,” she said. “Here locally in the city of Boston what we are going to be advocating [is] for a civilian review board with subpoena power. We are going to be advocating for increased funding in our schools and in our neighborhoods for restorative justice, practices to be implemented systemically so that we can help to reduce the need for police in our communities and instead work in partnership with law enforcement to bring about greater peace. It’s important for us also to keep in mind that what we saw in Minneapolis and what we saw in Georgia are examples of why leadership matters.” She said in both places, district attorneys have waited to press charges or have not pressed charges fully in significant cases. “As we’re looking at policies, like the use of excessive force, we need to be looking at those policies again to help ensure that we are eliminating from those policies practices that really are not meant to keep the peace but are meant to bring about death of individuals who are subjected to them.” Questions like whether Floyd’s knee to the neck was justifiable or whether the officers can be held accountable speaks to a broken system, according to Sullivan. “None of us who believe in humanity, none of us who believe in justice can believe for a moment that that is a type of death that someone should have to endure.” She said the NAACP is working with the legislature and the police department “here in the city of Boston so that we can help to prevent the type of murder that we saw in Minneapolis and in Louisville, Kentucky, and in Georgia.” Before the protests on Sunday, there were several conversations about “what the presence of our law enforcement officers would look like during these protests” to balance the need for safety and “understanding that the presence of police officers, of law enforcement in this moment can be triggering for many people,” Sullivan said. She appreciated that the police presence was not “overbearing” throughout the day and that police acted with the NAACP’s “concerns in mind.” “We do appreciate the de-escalation that we saw. We do appreciate the restraint that we saw. We also understand that there were some incidents last night where there are questions about how some officers may have interacted with our protesters so we will be looking at that,” said Sullivan.",0.0

They need to hear us because enough is enough because it just keeps happening over and over again.” Chiza joined nearly 200 people Monday at the Seashell Stage at Hampton Beach for a Black Lives Matter protest of the killing of Floyd. He also attended similar protests in Manchester and in Boston. Attendees at Hampton Beach held up signs reading “End Police Brutality,” “Justice for Floyd,” “Outraged” and “My Life Matters.” They stood silently with one hand in the air as the words of Martin Luther King Jr. played on a loudspeaker. The speech played was King’s “The Three Evils of Society,” which he gave at the height of the civil rights movement. Gerald Kimani, of Haverhill, Massachusetts, held up a sign that stated “I am not a threat. You can kill some of us, but you can’t kill all of us.“ “It’s getting old and we all need to stand together,” said Kimani, on what brought him out. “It’s not about black people. It’s not about white people. It’s about all of us. It’s about all of us versus the racists.” Portsmouth resident Keondray Lucas said he felt compelled to come out and protest the “injustices in our law system. ... That’s not saying all cops are bad. I don’t believe that at all. I believe that people are confused and scared and they want justice. They want peace. They want to go outside without fearing the people who are supposed to be there to protect us.” After the rally, attendees spoke out, urging those in attendance to keep making their voices heard. They also chanted “I can’t breathe, I can’t breathe,” words uttered by Floyd as an officer held him down with a knee over his neck. One attendee asked for the police officers in attendance to take a knee with them in solidarity. Hampton police Lt. Alex Reno and Seabrook Police Deputy Chief Kevin Gelineau joined them. “The lieutenant and I thought it was the right move,” Gelineau said. “We are supportive of their message. We understand and we are as devastated as they are. We don’t agree with what happened. Just because I wear a badge, doesn’t mean every decision a police officer makes in the country is supported by me simply because we are on the same job. And so we felt it was right to show them that we recognize why they are here and we are glad they were able to have a peaceful protest."" Prior to the rally, Reno stopped to talk to protesters individually. “We were just letting them know that we know why they are here and that nothing makes a good cop more angry than bad cops,” Reno said.

1623634305,2020-06-02 09:31:47,Keller @ Large- Trump Should Be Careful What He Wishes For  CBS Boston,https://boston.cbslocal.com/2020/06/01/jon-keller-president-trump-governor-phone-call-riots/,en,False,,317481,newhampshire.statenews.net,http://newhampshire.statenews.net/,"  BOSTON (CBS) – “If any demonstrator ever lays down in front of my car, it’ll be the last car he’ll ever lay down in front of.” Who said it? President Donald Trump, as part of Monday morning’s diatribe against governors grappling with street violence in which he repeatedly accused them of being “weak”? Actually, that rhetoric came from Alabama Gov. George Wallace during his 1968 presidential campaign. Then, as now, the campaign backdrop was a wave of violent riots in American cities touched off by the slaughter of a black man, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. “If you don’t dominate you’re wasting your time,” Trump lectured the governors – every last one with more experience and public popularity than he – Monday morning. “You’re going to look like a bunch of jerks. You have to dominate.” Ah yes, “law and order,” the laziest trope in American politics (with the possible exception of blaming the media). Bring ‘em down fast and hard, give ‘em a rough ride, and put ‘em away, the longer the better. It’s been a longtime staple of the Trump repertoire, most notably when he defended the railroading of five black teenagers for a vicious 1989 assault on a Central Park jogger, urging the death penalty for the kids, who were later proven innocent. And in this case, the appeal is obvious. No serious person likes the sight of looting, arson and gratuitous violence against police, including many of those marching now in protest of police brutality, who’ve been seen often on TV inserting themselves between the looters and agitators and their intended victims. It comes as no surprise to see the president lunging for the easiest hot button at hand. You can do that when you don’t think, don’t care, and “don’t take any responsibility” for the consequences of your actions. But Trump ought to be careful what he wishes for. Even the Trump administration has acknowledged that the “law and order” crackdown of the 1990s that packed the prisons was a failure; one of their few bipartisan legislative accomplishments was the 2019 First Step Act aimed at shortening prison sentences. And even in 1968, long before the costs and impotence of mass arrests and hardball prosecutions were apparent to all, the political limits of law-and-order red meat were evident. George Wallace drew less than 14% of the vote that fall. The narrow winner, Richard Nixon, also branded himself a law-and-order candidate, he leavened the message in ways we don’t hear from the current incumbent. “Our goal is justice for every American. If we are to have respect for law in America, we must have laws that deserve respect,” Nixon said in his 1968 nomination acceptance speech. “Just as we cannot have progress without order, we cannot have order without progress, and so, as we commit to order tonight, let us commit to progress.” In the fog of the guerrilla warfare that has erupted in some cities, it’s obvious that mistakes have been made by local leaders. But the risks of deploying overwhelming force in volatile situations where furious but peaceful demonstrators are mixed in with troublemakers and agitators of all sorts are well-documented, especially when you’re deploying National Guard troops with varying levels of training and familiarity with their surroundings. Just a few weeks ago we marked the 50th anniversary of the totally unjustified killings of four Kent State students by National Guardsmen during an antiwar protest. As always, Trump would be better off saying less, not more. He thinks his browbeating of the governors will excite his base and play to violence-wary swing voters, perhaps even reverse poll numbers cratering in the wake of his disastrous pandemic mismanagement. But what if his knee-jerk rhetoric just makes the situation worse? If governors heed his call to deploy more National Guard and even military forces, and they wind up repeating the Kent State debacle of killing innocent civilians, what then? Even Nixon knew better than to play the law-and-order card without at least a nod to the broader needs and issues at play. And Wallace found out the hard way how the politics of hate and incitement can come back to haunt. In 1972, Wallace was paralyzed from the waist down by gunfire from a disturbed fame seeker. And in a speech seven years later, he was contrite. “I have learned what suffering means,” he said. “In a way that was impossible, I think I can understand something of the pain black people have come to endure. I know I contributed to that pain, and I can only ask your forgiveness.”",0.0

Over the weekend, Portsmouth Police Chief Robert Merner released a statement calling Floyd’s death ""deeply disturbing."" On behalf of members of the Portsmouth Police Department, he said, ""Law enforcement officers are trained to treat all individuals, whether they are a complainant, suspect or a defendant, with dignity and respect. The callous manner in which this arrest was carried out is reprehensible."" Now-former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin has been charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter following the fatal arrest of Floyd on May 25. A video recorded by a bystander showed Chauvin kneeling on Floyd’s neck for nearly nine minutes, as other officers stood idly by. ""I want to express my heartfelt sympathy to the family, friends and loved ones of George Floyd,"" Merner said. ""We as a police agency are deeply disturbed by what we saw on that video."" Merner said both the ""actions and inactions"" of the Minneapolis police officers recorded on video ""jeopardize the gains that have been made throughout the policing profession in our country."" Floyd’s death should be of concern ""to not only all police officers and agencies but all Americans,"" he said. ""The officers' actions are totally inconsistent with the training and protocols of our profession."" Merner continued, ""The men and women of the Portsmouth Police Department will continue to work with the community to enhance the opportunity to build the trust that is tantamount in modern day policing."" In Dover, Police Chief William Breault penned an lengthy open letter to the community on Monday. His remarks came ahead of a planned peaceful protest at Henry Law Park later that night, organized by DREAM students at Dover High School. ""As your police chief, I want to reassure you that the women and men of the Dover Police Department remain steadfast in protecting the constitutional rights of everyone,"" Breault said. ""Now more than ever, as we move through these events together, I call on all community members to demonstrate respect and compassion for one another."" Breault said he is ""outraged and saddened"" by police actions in Minneapolis. Though occurring many states away, he said, the incident has ""eroded the very same public trust we have worked so hard to achieve."" ""What we saw occur in Minneapolis is not only completely against the mission, vision, and values of the Dover Police Department, but also the training, tactics, and professionalism with which our officers serve the community each and every day,"" he said. Breault said Dover officers receive the ""best and most current training available,"" demonstrating daily de-escalation and sound judgment. ""Please know that we as law enforcement professionals stand with you, feeling the same pain, anger, and frustration,"" said Breault. ""Let us all work together to make positive change and focus on keeping Dover a safe and peaceful place for everyone."" On Saturday, Gov. Chris Sununu issued a public statement after a Black Lives Matter protest on Elm Street in Manchester drew hundreds of people. ""This morning I called the organizers ahead of the George Floyd March in Manchester to let them know the state of New Hampshire stands with them in their calls for justice,"" said Sununu. ""This important conversation must continue and we must constructively work together as a nation to ensure there is change."" On Monday, Sununu said he has been in regular contact with New Hampshire State Police, local police departments and the National Guard ""to ensure New Hampshire remains safe."" He said the state will not condone violence against individuals, small businesses, or public property. ""Racism has no home and will not be tolerated in New Hampshire,"" Sunuu said. ""And neither does violence, looting or rioting.""",0.0

AP — Bebeto Matthews MINNEAPOLIS — George Floyd’s brother pleaded for peace in the streets Monday, saying destruction is “not going to bring my brother back at all,” while President Donald Trump berated most of the nation’s governors as “weak” for not cracking down harder on the lawlessness that has convulsed cities from coast to coast. The competing messages — one conciliatory, one bellicose — came as the U.S. braced for another round of violence at a time when the country already is buckling because of the coronavirus outbreak and the Depression-level unemployment it has caused. “We are a country that is scared,” said Sam Page, county executive in St. Louis County, Mo., where the city of Ferguson has been synonymous with the Black Lives Matter movement since the 2014 death of Michael Brown, a black 18-year-old, during a confrontation with a white officer. “We are a country that is angry. And we are a country that is holding out for the promise of justice for all.” In Minneapolis, Floyd’s brother, Terrence, made an emotional plea at the site where Floyd was pinned to the pavement by an officer who put his knee on the handcuffed black man’s neck for nearly nine minutes. “Let’s switch it up, y’all. Let’s switch it up. Do this peacefully, please,” Terrence Floyd said. The crowd chanted, “What’s his name? George Floyd!” and “One down, three to go!” in reference to the four officers involved in Floyd’s arrest. Officer Derek Chauvin has been charged with murder, but protesters are demanding that his colleagues be prosecuted, too. All four were fired. The gathering was part rally and part impromptu eulogy as Floyd urged people to stop the violence and use their power at the ballot box. “If I’m not over here messing up my community, then what are you all doing?” he said. “You all are doing nothing. Because that’s not going to bring my brother back at all.” The country has been beset by angry demonstrations for the past week in some of the most widespread racial unrest in the U.S. since the 1960s. Spurred in part by Floyd’s death, protesters have taken to the streets to decry the killings of black people by police. While most of the demonstrations have been peaceful, others have descended into violence, leaving neighborhoods in shambles, stores ransacked and cars burned, despite curfews around the country and the deployment of thousands of National Guard members in at least 15 states. Meanwhile, an autopsy commissioned for Floyd’s family found that he died of asphyxiation from neck and back compression, the family’s attorneys said. That distinguishes it from the official autopsy, which said he died from the effects of being restrained along with underlying health problems and potential intoxicants in his system. It found nothing “to support a diagnosis of traumatic asphyxia or strangulation.” The second autopsy was done by a doctor who also examined the body of Eric Garner, a New York man who died in an officer’s chokehold six years ago. While police in some places tried to calm tensions by kneeling or marching in solidarity, officers elsewhere were accused of treating protesters with the same kind of heavy-handed tactics that contributed to the unrest in the first place. Cities struggled to keep police in line. In Fort Lauderdale, Fla., an officer was suspended for pushing a kneeling woman to the ground during a protest. In Atlanta, two officers were fired after bashing in the window of a car and using a stun gun on the occupants. In Los Angeles, a police SUV accelerated into several protesters, knocking two people to the ground. In New York, the police commissioner said about six incidents were being investigated by the department’s internal affairs bureau, including a weekend confrontation in Brooklyn in which two police vehicles appeared to plow through a group of protesters. In another incident, an officer pointed a gun at protesters, drawing condemnation from the mayor. “I think some of the actions of the NYPD have exacerbated the anger,” New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said. “There are videos of some NYPD actions that are very disturbing. There are videos of NYPD cars driving into a crowd that are very disturbing. Pulling a mask down off a person to pepper spray them. Throwing a woman to the ground. It’s on video! It’s on video!” New York Mayor Bill de Blasio said he was considering imposing a curfew on the nation’s biggest city after groups of people broke into Chanel, Prada and Rolex boutiques and electronics stores on Sunday night. At the same time, the mayor said the law-breaking in the city of 8.6 million people was being “fomented by a very small number of violent protesters.” Around the country, political leaders girded for the possibility of more of what unfolded over the weekend: protesters hurling rocks and Molotov cocktails at police in Philadelphia, setting a fire near the White House and smashing their way into Los Angeles stores, running off with as much as they could carry. At least 4,400 people have been arrested for offenses such as stealing, blocking highways and breaking curfew, according to a count by The Associated Press. Police officers and National Guard soldiers enforcing a curfew in Louisville, Ky., killed a man early Monday when they returned fire after someone in a large group shot at them, police said. In Indianapolis, two people were reported dead in bursts of downtown violence over the weekend, adding to deaths recorded in Detroit and Minneapolis. Former Vice President Joe Biden, the Democratic presidential candidate, vowed to address institutional racism in his first 100 days in office. He met in person with black leaders in Delaware and also held a virtual meeting with big-city mayors. He said hate emerges “when you have somebody in power who breathes oxygen into the hate.”",0.0

Rollins said she is “exhausted” by instances of police officers killing black Americans “as if we were animals.” “This burning rage that you are seeing when you turn your TV on or you hear in my voice is real. People are fed up, and to the white community that is now waking up to see this rage, we have been telling you this forever,” Rollins said. “We have been saying this since Colin Kaepernick took a knee. We have been saying this for decades, and you didn’t listen to us. You didn’t care, until you saw a video.” “You will be prosecuted & held accountable but I will also say that buildings can be fixed…there are lives that were stolen & people that were lynched & murdered & they are never coming back.” Suffolk DA Rachael Rollins #wbz pic.twitter.com/VfMQIGFCCA — Christina Hager (@HagerWBZ) June 1, 2020 People looted stores, set fires and destroyed police vehicles from Downtown Crossing to Newbury and Boylston streets after Sunday’s peaceful protests.

And I am happy that those officers, I hope will make it out of it as well the civilians,” she said. “There are lives that were stolen, and people that were lynched and murdered, and they are never coming back. I hope that you take a minute to reflect what a terrible, terrible situation we are experiencing right now.” Leaders across America have been calling for calm amid the sometimes violent protests. Rollins said protesters “are disgusted and outraged – and they should be.” “It is completely ironic to have to say to you, ‘please don’t be violent. Please keep your voice down. Please be silent and comply with all of the police’s requirements, when in fact it’s those very people that murder us with impunity,'” Rollins said. “But that’s where we are right now.”",0.0

Chris Sununu danced a careful line in response to the national protests following the death of George Floyd, praising peaceful demonstrators but warning against potential violence and looting. At a press conference Monday, Sununu started out his remarks by highlighting the case of Floyd, an African American man whose death at the hands of a white Minneapolis police officer last week unleashed anger and protests in dozens of American cities over the weekend. “We all know that racism has no home here, and will not be tolerated anywhere in New Hampshire, and neither does violence and looting or rioting, by any stretch of the imagination,” he said. On Saturday, Sununu gave his blessing to a protest along Manchester’s Elm Street, calling organizers ahead of time to underscore that his office stood with them. That protest did not result in property damages or police clashes seen in other cities, though two counter-protesters were arrested after pointing handguns at the crowd. Sununu said the death of Floyd in Minneapolis, which led to the arrest of officer Derek Chauvin on third-degree murder charges, should prompt reform and “real action items” across the country. But he also warned that law enforcement would take action against demonstrators if violence emerged. “It has been very peaceful to date, but we know that at any moment, there’s no state, there’s no community that could potentially be immune from the potential of the violence and the rioting that we have seen unfortunately play out in other parts of the country,” he said. The governor distanced himself from rhetoric by President Donald Trump, who urged governors Monday to “dominate” protesters with law enforcement. “You have to dominate, if you don’t dominate you’re wasting your time,” Trump said, according to an audio version of the call first reported by CBS. “They’re going to run over you.” Those comments spurred backlash from activists, who have pointed to documented cases of police using force against unarmed protesters across the country this weekend. Earlier Monday Dan Feltes, a Democratic candidate for governor, had decried the comments, calling on Sununu, a Republican, to “finally speak out against Donald Trump’s divisive and violent rhetoric,” pointing to Monday’s comments and earlier ones from the president calling some of the protesters “thugs.” Sununu said he disagreed with the president’s advice. “Speaking for myself, no. I don’t think that anyone needs to be dominated,” Sununu said. But he argued that law enforcement should be deployed if violence emerged in the Granite State, and said he has been in contact with state police, local police departments, and the National Guard, which is currently assisting in the state’s COVID-19 response. “The good news is the men and women of the National Guard are incredibly flexible. And the fact that they can transition from whether it’s working at the food bank or working in a testing center (to) kind of mobilizing themselves on the frontline of a riot or anything of that nature, they can do it,” he said. “And they can do it very quickly.” Sununu also sought to draw a distinction between the protests happening in response to Floyd’s death – which are expected to continue through the week – and the ones that have happened in recent weeks against Sununu’s stay-at-home order, which has shuttered many businesses in response to the spread of COVID-19. The two causes are not on the same level, Sununu argued, praising protesters during the Floyd march for wearing face masks, which have often been absent from the “re-open New Hampshire” rallies. “Those that want to compare social injustices and the issue surrounding the murder of George Floyd, to the effectiveness of a stay at home or in social gatherings are completely missing the point,” Sununu said.

On full display, what you were seeing is the pain of black folks that has been delegitimized for far too long,” Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley said Tuesday, in response to days of protests after George Floyd‘s death. She and Suffolk District Attorney Rachael Rollins were among a group of state leaders that marched from the African-American Meeting House on Beacon Hill to the State House. The group aimed to lay out a multi-point plan for police accountability and policies to advance racial justice on multiple levels. Before they spoke to the media, they stood in silence for eight minutes and 46 seconds — the same amount of time Minneapolis Police Officer Derek Chauvin had his knee on Floyd’s neck. His death sparked outrage across the country, including in Boston. “Today we are going to be precise and prescriptive because the hurt and harm and the injustices that have been put on us were very precise, were very prescriptive, were very targeted,” Pressley said. She and Rep. Ilhan Omar have introduced a resolution to the House of Representatives. “In addition to calling on the House of Representatives to condemn all acts of police brutality racial profiling and excessive use of force. Our resolution calls for the adoption of reforms and policies at all levels of government to end these injustices, including: Efforts to improve oversight and independent investigations to hold individual law enforcement officers and police departments accountable Number two: calling on the [Department of Justice]. The DOJ which in this moment is the absence of justice and every iteration, but calling on the DOJ to reassert its statutory authority to investigate individual instances of racial profiling, or police brutality and violence and investigate and litigate individual law enforcement officers and police departments routinely violating civil rights. Number three: the resolution calls for supporting efforts to establish an all civilian review board with the authority to investigate incidents of police misconduct, to ensure community level oversight accountability and discipline the reaction of police officers. Number four: our congressional resolution calls for the adoption of sound and unbiased law enforcement policies at all levels of government that reduce the disparate impact of police brutality racial profiling and use of force on black and brown people, and other historically marginalized communities.” “The reason why there is a racial wealth gap in Boston is because of law, discriminatory, draconian law. So if hurt and harm, have been codified in law-making, then healing and justice should be codified in law-making,” Pressley said. She added that there will be no justice for the deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, or Tony McDade, but only accountability. “This is the tipping point,” Pressley concluded. State Representative Russell Holmes said Tuesday’s event was “to make sure we call out the things that so many of us have been working on for so long that have been ignored, quite frankly, you’re going to hear things today that the Congresswoman, that the black and Latino Caucus, that Congressional Black Caucus, that the Hispanic Caucus have been advocating for, for many years. But no one listened. It is awful, It is awful, that it takes a video of that nature, to make it so that folks wake up, and understand something we have known in all communities. It is now the time for all colleagues to listen to black people, listen to the things that we are saying would be most appropriate as a solution. Not your ideas that you want us to hope on, not your ideas that you formulated in some role. But here are our ideas.” Suffolk District Attorney Rachael Rollins also spoke. “Law enforcement is the only branch of our government, which all of our taxes pay for, that they have the right to kill, to use legal, lethal force, without any oversight. They don’t have to stop and call a hotline, they don’t have to do anything. And then it’s the D.A.’s that come in afterwards, the ones that at least have a spine and see whether that shooting was justified or reasonable. So I am not only going to let you yell at law enforcement right now because my job is just as equally as important and you have seen an epic failure of prosecutors across the country in not standing up and holding people accountable.” Lawrence Mayor Dan Rivera was also with the group. “If black and brown people can’t have life and liberty, no one should expect to have peaceful pursuit of happiness,” he said. “Remember that injustice in Minnesota threatens justice here in Boston and in Lawrence. I don’t support the violence and the vandalism, most of it was opted by people not in from our communities but I understand where it comes from.” Boston City Councilor Ricardo Arroyo shared the painful memory of being profiled by police as a teen. “He pulled his gun out again and pointed it at me and asked me again if I was stupid. In that moment time stopped for me,” he said. Suffolk County Sheriff Steven Tompkins delivered a powerful message to vote. “We can march, we can scream, we can cry, we can die, but if we are not controlling the levers of power in this country, we are done,” he said.",0.0
1623634184,2020-06-02 13:12:11,Stevens Praises Celtics Players For Active Leadership Outside Of NBA u2013 CBS Boston,https://boston.cbslocal.com/2020/06/02/brad-stevens-praises-celtics-brown-smart-active-roles-leadership-nba-george-floyd-protests/,en,False,,317481,newhampshire.statenews.net,http://newhampshire.statenews.net/,"  BOSTON (CBS) — Celtics head coach Brad Stevens is saddened by what is going on in the country at the moment. But he is extremely proud of his players for standing up and taking an active role in the fight for racial equality in America. Boston players Jaylen Brown, Marcus Smart, Enes Kanter and Vincent Poirier were all part of protests over the weekend, stemming from the murder of George Floyd during a police arrest last week in Minneapolis. Brown, a Georgia native, made the 15-hour drive from Boston to Atlanta to lead a peaceful protest in his home state on Saturday, while Smart, Kanter and Poirier all played active roles in protests in Boston on Sunday. “I think it’s been great,” Stevens said of the activism his players have been partaking in. “I think paying attention and having individual conversations with everyone on our team, knowing what has happened has been appalling and brutal and hurtful and painful. I’ve said this many times, I think the NBA is amazing and our players are amazing. We’re lucky we have such great people representing us with the Celtics.” During his Tuesday video conference with reporters, Stevens did not mince his words at the current state of the country, which has seen peaceful protests in many cities turn into violent riots and looting. “I think that a lot of people feel the pain and it transfers to anger,” the head coach said. “I wrote a letter to our guys this weekend, and it took me a while to put down exactly what I wanted to say. The thing I wanted them to know is that every decent person is hurting. Every decent person feels the pain of the African American community. But I don’t want to pretend I know the exact distinct pain. I wanted them to know I was with them and I think that’s very important. “It’s so great to see so many guys so active,” he continued. “I’ve talked to a lot of guys – everybody is hurting. The leadership they have shown is terrific, and hopefully, the most important thing is we can work toward short-term healing and long-term sustainable action that creates change.” Stevens continues to be impressed with Brown, who in addition to having a breakout season in 2019-20, continues to further himself as a valuable contributor to society away from the basketball court. “Jaylen’s greatest impact, as good as he is at basketball, won’t be in basketball,” said Stevens. “He’s a special guy and a special leader. He is smart and has courage. He has a lot of great stuff to him and I think we recognized that when we drafted him. But he has been even more unbelievable every day, every year. I’ve always, personally, really enjoyed listening to him and talking to him about things outside of basketball. “I’m not surprised by him taking a leadership role. That’s who he is,” Stevens said of the 23-year-old. With a league made up of predominantly white head coaches and figureheads, Stevens said it’s important that they embrace what their players are fighting for, and take on an active role as much as they can. “We may not be able to know the depth of the pain of our colleagues that are black, players or assistance that are black, but we have a responsibility to be empathetic and drive change,” he said. “We have all been in these conversations before and you’re moved to drive change. Sometimes actionable steps lead to what you think is progress, but this sure doesn’t look like progress. What we need to do is play our part and make sure we’re part of long-term, sustainable change.” The NBA hasn’t played in over two months due to the coronavirus pandemic, and with the recent events around the country, Stevens said the hiatus has furthered his appreciation for the game. Not for what they accomplish on the floor, but what the NBA represents as a whole. “Sports are powerful things. There has been very little way to feel a part of a community than when you’re moving towards a common goal and common desire. In sports, that happens whenever you get in the locker room and people from all walks of life are joined in,” he said. “You learn to be part of others and part of a team, and that is irreplaceable. Not only from my own perspective but my family’s perspective too. I love that my kids have grown up the members of diverse teams, both racially and nationally, their whole loves. “It’s special to be a part of it and I don’t think it’s a huge surprise our guys can lead with such courage,” he continued. “They put themselves out there every day in a kind of a meaningless game, when you think about it. The impact we all can have on each other is pretty special. Those relationships I’ve made, what I’ve learned from players and staff, the people you are coaching and coaching against, are pretty special and I’m thankful for it.”",0.0

Floyd died after being restrained by Minneapolis police officers on Memorial Day. (AP Photo/Frank Franklin II) Frank Franklin II For Rogers Johnson, turning back the clock was easy. He laughed and used a wonderful play on words, crisp and revealing in their simplicity, attributed to Hall of Fame catcher Yogi Berra. “First things first,” the leader of the N.H. NAACP said by phone. “I was a product of the ’60s, so this is déjà vu all over again.” Turn on the TV, read the newspapers, go online. Cops and citizens are fighting each other, all over the country, in major cities. Racial disharmony is exploding off the charts. We’ve seen it before in recent years, the match and the fuse, then ensuing violence. This time the black man’s name was George Floyd, whose death at the hands of police in Minnesota is yet another watershed moment in the history of race relations in this country. If you’re old enough to remember the 1960s, or if you’ve read about it and seen those black-and-white photos from that era, you know African Americans were attacked by police dogs, beaten with clubs and sprayed with howitzer-like hoses. Today? Police wearing riot gear are shooting tear gas and rubber bullets into crowds gathering across the country since Floyd’s death. Some were rowdy and needed to be reeled in during stressful conditions. Others simply wanted respect, equal opportunities and the ability to drive to the corner market without being terrified. “We want to make people aware that this is not unusual,” Johnson said, referring to Floyd’s death. “This is something that has occurred in everyday life in the black community, and that is how we handle things in America.” Johnson saw both sides, the part about displaying justified anger – shortly after moments like Dr. King’s assassination in 1968 and Floyd’s death last month – and crossing a line that pushes this important matter to the background. “Violence obscures the message,” Johnson said. “And you want a message that black people are concerned about just driving down the road and getting pulled over. You never know what’s going to happen.” Rogers is a black man whose résumé of leadership and fighting discrimination sparkles. He grew up in a Westchester suburb of New York City. He and his brothers were great high school athletes, and there were plenty of African Americans around to play sandlot and organized ball. And guess what? Someone forgot to tell the kids in Johnson’s neighborhood that black and white don’t mix. “No racial discrimination,” Rogers said. “We played at everyone’s house, pool hopping in each neighborhood. We went to Rye Playland and the beach and Yankee Stadium and Shea Stadium. No one bothered anyone. It was magnificent.” Janice M. Alberghene of Dover is 71. Her résumé is busting at the seams as well. She’s an author and a doctor of philosophy. She protested against the Vietnam War, but her mind flashed back to the 1960s and the other mayhem of the day. In fact, her Facebook page says this: “Our cities burned in the 1960s; racism, poverty, the war in Vietnam. Year 2020. Our cities burn; racism, poverty, and the higher rates of COVID-19 that result. I’ve never been more angered by every ‘non-racist’ white person who stays silent. I don’t acquit myself of this crime, but I can sure as hell tell you that speaking up and acting up is everybody’s job.” Alberghene’s radar is forever on high alert when tension like this explodes. She’s white. So’s her husband, Sen. David Watters, a Democrat from Dover, who teaches African American literature and history at the University of New Hampshire. Their son? He’s a professional ballet dancer in Houston. He’s adopted. He’s black. Alberghene was affable throughout our talk, but she admitted she grows upset when people look to her for answers, simply because of the color of her son’s skin. “It’s the responsibility of all of us if we hear or see someone doing something that’s racist,” she said. African Americans I spoke to said the same thing, that they’ve grown weary and impatient and can understand why people got mad, while knowing that the destruction of businesses is not the way to go. Johnson said he saw two types of protesters, then and now. The 1960s, he said, was cleaner at its heart. “The riots of the ’60s and ’70s,” he said, “were a result of frustration with the lack of progress with race relations as a whole. Today’s riots are the results of people taking advantage of situations conducive of turmoil and not a reaction to racial injustice.” No matter how you slice it, of course, the core issue remains the same. We’re not there yet. Perhaps we should listen to a pair of young adults. Maybe their perspective will inspire us to make changes. Tyrell Whitted of Manchester is a black psychology major at the University of New Hampshire. He’s 24, far too young to remember the old days, but he’s analyzed both eras and said that what’s happening today is a rebirth of sorts from the ’60s. He was slated to attend a rally on Tuesday night at Stark Park in Manchester to promote peaceful protesting. He wants to be a leader for change and believes his generation will get it done. “It’s almost like the second wave of civil rights,” Whitted told me. “All over the country people are getting violent and the police are getting angry. We’re constantly being shown images of police brutality and racism. It seems to be constant, and we are going to break that cycle.” Marcus Boggis is the 34-year-old son of Jerrianne Boggis, the head of the Portsmouth Black Heritage Trail. She’s also on the board of the N.H. Civil Rights Commission. Her son is an ‘IT’ guy living in Quincy, Mass. He knows the ’60s through reading and once thought that that era would evolve into something special, full of tolerance and color-blindness. Now he’s not so sure. “Frankly,” Boggis said, “I am a very optimistic person and I thought that no matter what we’ve gone through in the past, I never thought I’d have to worry about this when my kids are grown.” His daughter is 2.",0.0

(AP Photo/Ashley Landis) Ashley Landis Spike Lee attends a special 20th anniversary screening of his film “Do the Right Thing” in New York in 2009. AP — Peter Kramer NEW YORK — It’s not the first time that Spike Lee’s Do the Right Thing has been freshly urgent, but Lee’s 1989 film has again found blistering relevance in the wake of George Floyd’s death. On Monday, Lee released a short film titled 3 Brothers connecting the death of Radio Raheem (played by Bill Nunn) in Do the Right Thing to the deaths of Floyd and Eric Garner. Floyd died last week after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee against his neck as he begged for air. Garner’s dying plea of “I can’t breathe” became a rallying cry against police brutality in 2014. Blazed across the screen is the question: “Will history stop repeating itself?” “I’ve seen this before. This is not new,” Lee said in an interview with The Associated Press on Monday. “I was born in ’57 so I was 11 years old when I saw the riots with Dr. King’s assassination, later on with Rodney King and the Simi Valley verdict, Trayvon Martin and Ferguson.” “People are tired and they take to the streets,” Lee said. Do the Right Thing, about rising racial tensions on a hot summer day in Brooklyn’s Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood, took direct inspiration from reality. In the film, Raheem is choked to death by a police officer, sparking a riot. Lee modeled the choke hold that kills Raheem on the murder of Michael Stewart, a graffiti artist who was killed by New York City police officers in 1983. Lee dedicated the film to Stewart’s family, as well as those of several other black people killed by police officers. “His death is not just made up. Many years later, Eric Garner, automatically I thought of Ray Raheem,” said Lee. “Then to see my brother George Floyd. I mean, he was quoting the words of Eric Garner: ‘I can’t breathe.’ He was channeling Eric Garner. I’m sure of it.” As much as Lee sees history repeating itself, there’s one element of the current unrest that strikes the filmmaker as new. “I’ve been very encouraged by the diversity of the protesters. I haven’t seen this diverse protests since when I was a kid,” Lee said, citing the movements of the ’60s. “I’m encouraged that my wife’s sisters and brothers are out there. “That is the hope of this country, this diverse, younger generation of Americans who don’t want to perpetuate the same (expletive) that their parents and grandparents and great-grandparents got caught up in. That’s my hope.” To illustrate the point, Lee cited cities with smaller black populations, like Des Moines, Iowa, where protests and riots have occurred. “My young white sisters and brothers are out there in the streets. How many black folks are in Salt Lake City, Utah? And let’s take into account that the NBA is not playing,” said Lee, letting out an enormous cackle. “The Utah Jazz are not playing!” 3 Brothers is the second short Lee has released during the pandemic. While Lee has kept to his Upper East Side apartment with his family, he has also biked around the city to shoot. Lee’s New York, New York, set to Frank Sinatra, was released in early May as an ode to his outbreak-stricken city. Next week, he’ll release on Netflix Da Five Bloods, a Vietnam War drama about four black veterans who return to Vietnam to find the remains of their fallen squad leader (Chadwick Boseman). Lee has only modest hopes for justice in the aftermath of Floyd’s death. Attorney General William Barr he calls “not a friend to justice.” “He’s going to do what Agent Orange tell him to do,” said Lee, using his favored nickname for President Donald Trump. But Lee has been buoyed by a photo of New York police officers kneeling with protesters, an image he likened to Colin Kaepernick’s NFL protests. “They need to show the image more,” said Lee. “Colin Kaepernick is a patriot.”",0.0

AP — Yuki Iwamura WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump on Tuesday turned up the pressure on governors to quell the violence set off by the death of George Floyd, demanding New York call up the National Guard to stop the “lowlifes and losers.” As cities around the U.S. witnessed a seventh straight night of both peaceful demonstrations and bursts of theft, vandalism and attacks on police, the president amplified his hard-line calls of a day earlier, in which he threatened to send in the military to restore order if governors didn’t do it. “NYC, CALL UP THE NATIONAL GUARD,” he tweeted. “The lowlifes and losers are ripping you apart. Act fast! Don’t make the same horrible and deadly mistake you made with the Nursing Homes!!!” In New York on Monday night, people smashed shop windows near Rockefeller Center and breached the doors of Macy’s flagship store on 34th Street despite the first curfew in the city in decades. Police said nearly 700 people were arrested and several officers injured in the overnight violence. New York and other cities braced for more trouble after nightfall Tuesday, with Mayor Bill de Blasio extending an 8 p.m. curfew all week. “We’re going to have a tough few days,” he warned, but added: “We’re going to beat it back.” He said he would do that with the help of community leaders, urging them to step forward: “Create peace. … Stand up.” More than 20,000 National Guard members have been called up in 29 states to deal with the violence. New York is not among them. De Blasio has said he does not want the Guard, and Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo has said he will not send it into the city against the mayor’s wishes. During the violence that gripped communities from coast to coast again on Monday night, police officers were shot, run over and showered with rocks and bottles. In Atlanta, police fired tear gas at demonstrators. In Nashville, more than 60 National Guard members put down their riot shields at the request of peaceful protesters. And at a demonstration in Buffalo, N.Y., an SUV plowed into a group of officers, injuring three. An officer was shot and gravely wounded as police tried to disperse a crowd outside a Las Vegas hotel and casino. Four officers were shot in St. Louis; they were expected to recover. “We have been sitting on a powder keg for some time and it has burst,” Philadelphia Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw said. In Philadelphia, where hundreds of protesters spilled onto a highway in the heart of the city, Mayor Jim Kenney described a chaotic night in which one person was killed attempting to use explosives to open an ATM, a gun shop owner fatally shot a would-be thief, and a 19-year-old died of injuries during looting. About a dozen other deaths have been reported around the country over the past week. Some protesters framed the burgeoning movement as a necessity after a string of killings by police. “I fear for my safety every time I get in the car to go for a drive. I fear of getting pulled over. I fear for all 10 of my brothers’ and sisters’ lives, for my parents’ lives!” 19-year-old Amari Burroughs of Parkland, Fla., said Tuesday as she prepared for another protest. “My goal is to use my voice and my leadership to make this world safer so that one day I can bring children here and won’t have to fear for their safety.” Outside the Minnesota Capitol in St. Paul, where a youth protest was held Tuesday, 18-year-old Joseph Tawah agreed. “It’s really hard not to feel afraid,” he said. More than 5,600 people nationwide have been arrested over the past week for such offenses as stealing, blocking highways and breaking curfew, according to a count by The Associated Press. In Richmond, Va., several hundred people gathered outside City Hall on Tuesday, shouting down Mayor Levar Stoney, who apologized for police lobbing tear gas at peaceful demonstrators. “Where were you last night when we were being tear-gassed?” a woman yelled. “Where were you? Where were you? Where were you?” the crowd chanted. Meanwhile, Democratic governors and mayors rejected Trump’s threat to send in the military, questioning whether the federal government has such authority and warning that such a step would be incendiary. De Blasio said military troops would create “a dangerous scenario,” while Colorado Gov. Jared Polis and Denver Mayor Michael Hancock likewise warned such a move would just lead to more violence and destruction. “Denver is not Little Rock in 1957, and Donald Trump is not President Eisenhower. This is a time for healing, for bringing people together, and the best way to protect civil rights is to move away from escalating violence,” they said in a statement, referring to Eisenhower’s use of troops to enforce school desegregation in the South. Even some in the president’s own party rebuffed the idea, including Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee, who said his state has what it needs. “The military is here to protect and defend this country. We don’t have that need here in this state,” he said. A senior White House official said Tuesday that despite Trump’s threats, the goal was to pressure governors to deploy more National Guard members. The president is not rushing to use the Insurrection Act to send in the military, according to the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The unrest in Minneapolis, meanwhile, appeared to stabilize on the same day Floyd’s brother made an impassioned plea for peace at the spot where a white police officer, Derek Chauvin, put his knee on the handcuffed black man’s neck for several minutes, even after he stopped moving and pleading for air. Chauvin has been charged with murder. Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said Tuesday that prosecutors were working as fast as they can to determine if the three other officers at the scene should be charged too. All four have been fired. Floyd’s family was expected to join a march in Houston on Tuesday. The state of Minnesota opened an investigation into whether the Minneapolis Police Department has a pattern of discrimination against minorities. Cities struggled to keep police in line and avoid instances of excessive force. The police chief in Louisville, Ky., was fired after a restaurant owner was killed by police and National Guard members enforcing a curfew. In Richmond, the police chief said officers who used tear gas on a group of peaceful protesters would be disciplined. In Atlanta, six officers were charged Tuesday after a video showed authorities dragging two young people from a car during protests. Sending the military into the states would mark a stunning federal intervention rarely seen in modern American history. It drew comparisons to 1968, when Richard Nixon ran as the law-and-order candidate in the aftermath of riots following the assassination of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. Federal law allows presidents to dispatch the military into states to suppress an insurrection or if a state is defying federal law, legal experts said. But some state officials asserted that the president does not have a unilateral right to send in troops against the will of local governments.",0.0

(AP Photo/Michel Euler) Michel Euler PARIS — Thousands of French protesters defied a virus-related police ban and rallied Tuesday against racial injustice and heavy-handed police tactics, as global outrage over what happened to George Floyd in the United States kindled frustrations across borders and continents. Clapping, cheering and waving signs reading “Black Lives Matter” and “Police Everywhere, Justice Nowhere,” the largely young, multiracial crowd streamed to the main Paris courthouse and rallied peacefully while police monitored closely from nearby corners. Earlier, thousands marched in Sydney, Australia’s largest city, chanting “I can’t breathe,” and expressions of anger erupted in multiple languages on social networks, with thousands of Swedes joining an online protest and others speaking out under the banner of #BlackOutTuesday. Diplomatic ire percolated too, with the European Union’s top foreign policy official saying the bloc was “shocked and appalled” by Floyd’s death. As protests escalated worldwide, solidarity with U.S. demonstrators increasingly mixed with local worries. “When you refuse to treat the problem of racism … it leads to what we see in the United States,” said Dominique Sopo, head of French activist group SOS Racisme. “The case of George Floyd echoes what we fear in France.” Floyd died last week after a police officer pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes even after he stopped moving and pleading for air. The death set off protests that spread across America — and now, beyond. Fears of the coronavirus remain close to the surface and were the reason cited by the police for banning Tuesday’s protest at the main Paris courthouse. Gatherings of more than 10 people remain banned in France as part of virus confinement measures. But the Paris protest plans drew attention online, and demonstrators showed up anyway. Similar demonstrations were held in other French cities in honor of Adama Traore, who died shortly after his arrest in 2016, and in solidarity with Americans demonstrating against Floyd’s death. The Traore case has become emblematic of the fight against police brutality in France. The circumstances of the death of the 24-year-old Frenchman of Malian origin are still under investigation after four years of conflicting medical reports about what happened. The lawyer for two of the three police officers involved in the arrest, Rodolphe Bosselut, said the Floyd and Traore cases “have strictly nothing to do with each other.” Bosselut told The Associated Press that Traore’s death wasn’t linked with the conditions of his arrest but other factors, including a pre-existing medical condition. Traore’s family says he died from asphyxiation because of police tactics — and that his last words were “I can’t breathe.” “I can’t breathe” were also the final words of David Dungay, a 26-year-old Aboriginal man who died in a Sydney prison in 2015 while being restrained by five guards. As 3,000 people marched peacefully through Sydney, many said they had been inspired by a mixture of sympathy for African Americans amid ongoing violent protests in the U.S. and to call for change in Australia’s treatment of its indigenous population, particularly involving police. The mostly Australian crowd at the authorized demonstration also included protesters from the U.S. and elsewhere. “I’m here for my people, and for our fallen brothers and sisters around the world,” said Sydney indigenous woman Amanda Hill, 46, who attended the rally with her daughter and two nieces. “What’s happening in America shines a light on the situation here. It doesn’t matter if it’s about the treatment of black men and women from here or from another country; enough is enough,” she said. A total of 432 indigenous Australians have died in police detention since a 1991 Royal Commission — Australia’s highest level of official inquiry — into Aboriginal deaths in custody, according to The Guardian newspaper. Australia has also never signed a treaty with the country’s indigenous population, who suffer higher-than-average rates of infant mortality and poor health, plus shorter life expectancy and lower levels of education and employment than white Australians. Another protest was planned Tuesday in the Dutch capital The Hague, and more than 6,000 people attended a Sweden-organized online protest to express support with the Black Lives Matter movement. Among speakers was Aysha Jones, a Gambia-born and Sweden-based activist and fashion blogger. Jones said the protest was important to show support to people in America, but also to remind Swedes that racism “does exist here, it’s very real and people are being harmed from it.” More protests in various countries are planned later in the week, including a string of demonstrations in front of U.S. embassies on Saturday. The drama unfolding in the U.S. drew increasing diplomatic concern. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell’s remarks in Brussels were the strongest to come out of the 27-nation bloc, saying Floyd’s death was a result of an abuse of power. Borrell told reporters that “like the people of the United States, we are shocked and appalled by the death of George Floyd.” He underlined that Europeans “support the right to peaceful protest, and also we condemn violence and racism of any kind, and for sure, we call for a de-escalation of tensions.” German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said peaceful protests in the U.S. following Floyd’s death are “understandable and more than legitimate.” “I can only express my hope that the peaceful protests do not continue to lead to violence, but even more express the hope that these protests have an effect in the United States,” Maas said. More African leaders are speaking up over the killing of Floyd. “It cannot be right that, in the 21st century, the United States, this great bastion of democracy, continues to grapple with the problem of systemic racism,” Ghana President Nana Akufo-Addo said in a statement, adding that black people the world over are shocked and distraught. Kenyan opposition leader and former Prime Minister Raila Odinga offered a prayer for the U.S., “that there be justice and freedom for all human beings who call America their country.” Like some in Africa who have spoken out, Odinga also noted troubles at home, saying the judging of people by character instead of skin color “is a dream we in Africa, too, owe our citizens.”",0.0

AP — Matt Rourke PHILADELPHIA — Joe Biden on Tuesday blistered President Donald Trump a day after police drove back peaceful protesters near the White House so Trump could pose with a Bible before a damaged church. Biden said Trump’s “narcissism has become more important than the nation that he leads.” The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee delivered a speech at Philadelphia’s City Hall, addressing the civil unrest across America following the death of George Floyd. Biden said “the moment has come” to deal with systemic racism and deeply ingrained economic inequality — and insisted that the nation can’t wait until November’s election and its outcome. “I call on the Congress to act this month,” Biden said, urging lawmakers to start “with real police reform” and citing proposed legislation outlawing choke holds. But Biden stepped up his criticism of Trump as he works to elevate his voice in the national debate — after more than two months of the campaign for the White House being frozen amid the outbreak of the coronarvius. “This president today is part of the problem and accelerates it,” Biden said, adding that Trump is “consumed with his blinding ego.” Biden’s criticism comes a day after Trump threatened the nation’s governors that he would deploy the military to states if they did not stamp out violent protests over police brutality that have roiled the nation. Authorities under federal command later forced back peaceful demonstrators in Washington with tear gas so the president could walk to nearby church St. John’s Church and pose briefly with a Bible. The church had sustained damage during Sunday protests. Biden noted that “peaceful protesters” were dispersed from the “doorstep of the people’s house, the White House” using tear gas and flash grenades to stage what he called a “photo op” publicity stunt. “The president held up a Bible,” Biden added. “I just wished he opened it once in awhile instead of brandishing it.” The 20-plus minute address was covered live by cable networks and Biden used it to declare, “This job’s not about me. It’s about you. It’s about us.” “Look, the presidency is a big job. Nobody will get everything right. And I won’t either,” Biden said, but promised, “I won’t fan the flames of hate.” As the former vice president spoke, the National Guard maintained a visible presence to defend public buildings as Philadelphia grapples with sustained violent protests. Several adjacent businesses — banks, convenience stores and hotels were boarded up. A very small audience, including Mayor Jim Kenney, was on hand. Biden is trying to create a stark contrast with Trump, who has embraced the language of confrontation and war, casting himself as the “president of law and order.” Trump signaled he would stake his reelection on convincing voters his forceful approach was warranted in a time of national tumult and racial unrest. “I will seek to heal the racial wounds that have long plagued this country — not use them for political gain,” Biden said.",0.0
1623641318,2020-06-02 17:09:21,Black female mayors in spotlight amid protests and pandemic,https://www.concordmonitor.com/Black-female-mayors-in-spotlight-amid-protests-and-pandemic-34585295,en,False,,29410,concordmonitor.com,http://www.concordmonitor.com#spider,"DETROIT — Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms captured the nation’s attention when she addressed the civil unrest occurring in her city after George Floyd’s death. “I am a mother to four black children in America, one of whom is 18 years old,” Bottoms said Friday in a rousing speech. “When I saw the murder of George Floyd, I hurt like a mother.” Bottoms and other black female mayors, including Lori Lightfoot of Chicago, are leading some of the nation’s largest cities during an unprecedented moment of challenge as protests against police brutality overlap with the coronavirus pandemic and an economic collapse. They’re being praised as thoughtful leaders at a time of political tumult and high-profile examples of black women seeking and winning political office across the country. Higher Heights for America PAC, a political action committee dedicated to electing more progressive black women, said there are seven black women serving as mayors in the nation’s 100 most populous U.S. cities, compared to just one in 2014. “Black women have always been leading and we have been the defenders of our homes, our communities and our nation,” said Glynda Carr, the president and CEO of Higher Heights. “Our leadership was built for this moment and their unique experiences as black women, not only as Americans, has provided the type of trusted leadership that can help move this country forward.” The mayors have demonstrated leadership with personal connections. Lightfoot, Chicago’s first black female mayor and first openly gay leader, frankly acknowledged America’s dark history of racism and blasted President Donald Trump’s divisive tweets in which he called protesters “thugs” and said “when the looting starts, the shooting starts.” “It’s impossible for me as a black woman who has been the target of blatant racism over the course of my life not to take the killing of George Floyd personally,” Lightfoot said. “Being black in America should not be a death sentence.” The question is whether this moment will translate into a long-lasting higher profile for the mayors. Bottoms, for example, was already believed to be under consideration as Joe Biden’s running mate before the protests. Her stature has only risen amid the unrest. Beyond her well-received remarks Friday, she acted swiftly two days later, firing two police officers and placing three others on desk duty over excessive use of force during a protest arrest involving two college students. “Use of excessive force is never acceptable,” Bottoms told reporters. Nadia Brown, a political science professor at Purdue University, said her research has found that many black female leaders, especially within their own communities, are seen as relatable figures — something that has worked in their favor at this time. During the pandemic, residents made viral memes of Lightfoot enforcing her stay-at-home orders. Instead of chiding them, Lightfoot embraced the moment and used it to connect with residents, Brown said. “I think that we’re seeing some of this play out in real time,” Brown said. “She was speaking in that role of telling residents what to do from an authority figure that seemed very familiar. And I think that’s kind of a mode in which we’re seeing some other black women elected officials deal with unrest in that they’re speaking to constituents not just as an authority figure but one that is familiar.” Rochester, N.Y., Mayor Lovely Warren, who is in her second term as the first black female mayor of the state’s third-largest city, said that while black women have made strides in gaining prominence, they still face unique challenges of racism and stereotypes. “We’re trying to fight a system that was institutionally built to create the disparities that it has created over generations and so we’re trying to undo the damage that has been done to prepare our children for the future,” Warren said. “A lot of times we get branded with the ‘angry black woman syndrome’ when we’re speaking up to a number of different issues that impact our community, but we have been built to take on the responsibility and we take it in stride.” “No matter which mayor I look at across this country right now, they have done an extraordinary job trying to balance all that’s coming toward them,” Warren added. Other black mayors including San Francisco’s London Breed and Muriel Bowser of Washington have also been recognized for their measured responses and handling of their communities. A’shanti Gholar, president of Emerge America, an organization that recruits and trains Democratic women to run for office, said many of the black women in office today were entrenched in grassroots political work for decades, paving the way for those to come behind them. “This is about a movement, a movement of women extending and taking their leadership all over across the country,” Gholar said. “Black women running for office and winning, it isn’t an anomaly. They’re also building up the next generation of black women elected officials and black women mayors who they’re inspiring to run.” Although gains have been made, Carr said there’s still much more work to be done. Biden has pledged to pick a woman as a running mate and is considering several women of color. No black woman has ever served as governor in the country. Carr noted that black women make up 7.6% of the country’s population yet account for just 4.3% of all members of the House and 1% of the Senate. “All that we celebrate about the gains we made 51 years after Shirley Chisholm became the first black woman to serve in Congress, we also recognize that the 23 million black women in this country are so underrepresented and underserved,” Carr said. “So, we need to continue to invest in recruiting, training and supporting black woman.”",0.0

AP — Lars Baron Players who scored in the German and Hungarian soccer leagues removed their jerseys to display undershirts with the words: “Justice for George Floyd.” Others from English soccer clubs Liverpool, Chelsea and Newcastle dropped to one knee during practice in a clear gesture of support. In New Zealand, a Nigerian-born UFC fighter addressed a crowd of 4,000, imploring those listening to “speak up” and take peaceful action to register their discontent. Dismayed by the death of Floyd and inspired by the actions of Colin Kaepernick, athletes from around the world have come together during one of the most politically charged periods in modern history. “I can’t tolerate. I won’t tolerate. WE WON’T TOLERATE,” Manchester United midfielder Paul Pogba, one of the world’s most famous soccer players and a World Cup champion with France, wrote on his Instagram page to his 41 million followers alongside a picture of him looking to the sky with a clenched right fist. It was powerful image to accompany the picture of 29 Liverpool players kneeling around the center circle at Anfield Stadium at the end of a practice session on Monday. Or the entire Chelsea squad kneeling down and forming the letter “H” — for humans — during training on Tuesday. Their actions mimicked the one made by Kaepernick during the national anthem in 2016 in silent protest of police brutality and racism while then playing for the San Francisco 49ers. Kaepernick’s gesture kicked off a period of pregame activism in the NFL and other sports but it didn’t gain a strong hold worldwide. Not like the killing of Floyd, a black man and former community college basketball player who died after a white police officer pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck for several minutes even after he stopped moving and stopped pleading for air. “It hit a nerve in this very particular time, which I think made people all around the world reflect on the environment we live, not only in the U.S. but in all kinds of places where there is a perpetuation of discrimination and inequality,” Jonas Baer-Hoffmann, secretary general of global soccer players union FIFPro, told The Associated Press. “We’re seeing a generation of players right now moving into the steps of athletes in the past who were socially quite engaged and willing to put themselves behind causes they care about. I think it’s incredibly empowering to see these players step forward and share in that fight for a better society.” Things have escalated so much that FIFA, the governing body of world soccer, took the rare step of urging competition organizers to consider not sanctioning players who support justice for Floyd during matches. The laws of the game prohibit “any political, religious or personal slogans, statements or images.” “The application of the laws of the game … should use common sense and have in consideration the context surrounding the events,” FIFA said, acknowledging “the depth of sentiment” regarding Floyd’s death. English soccer leaders have already said players will be able to show solidarity without the prospect of facing sanctions when games resume this month after a three-month break because of the coronavirus pandemic. Emboldened soccer players appear to be more confident in speaking out about racism than ever before, including Jadon Sancho, who revealed a handwritten “Justice for George Floyd” message on his undershirt after scoring a goal for Borussia Dortmund on Sunday, openly and knowingly flouting the rules. Marcus Rashford, a black striker for Manchester United, called for justice for Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor — two other black people killed in shooting incidents in America this year — on Twitter in the wake of Floyd’s death. Soccer players may also take what has happened to Floyd more personally because of how often black players have been abused inside stadiums around Europe in recent years. The sanctions for racism — if they are handed out at all — can often be derisory. As their own form of protest, some black players have taken to walking off the field after being racially abused by fans because many have little faith in authorities and governing bodies to effect change. That’s the position many protesters in the United States are finding themselves in. Baer-Hoffman said the reaction of sports stars was a reflection of uncertain times around the world since the outbreak of the coronavirus. “Maybe it’s because we are living in a time where the interconnectedness of people through the pandemic has become more conscious to us all,” he said. “When you look at the images (of the incident involving Floyd), it is manifestly disturbing. It scares you and forces you to think … I think it stands for something much greater. For footballers in this context, they are people … They are speaking out and, of course, have a bigger platform than most.” When Kaepernick took a knee four years ago, United States star Megan Rapinoe was one of the few high-profile soccer players to champion his cause publicly. But the clear parallel between Kaepernick’s action and the knee of the police officer on Floyd’s neck has roused more athletes to speak out. “In no way are we asking black lives to matter more than white lives,” DeAndre Yedlin, a U.S. soccer international who plays with Newcastle in England, wrote on Twitter. “All we’re asking is we are seen as equal, as more than 3/5 of a man, as humans. My heart goes out in solidarity to George Floyd, his family, and all of the countless number of victims that have had their lives taken at the hands of meaningless police brutality.”",0.0

On Wednesday, the Senate Judiciary Committee begins the first of a planned series of hearings on the origins of the FBI's 2016 Russia investigation into possible ties with the Trump campaign. Republicans are particularly interested in the decision-making inside the Obama-Biden administration. Further, the Senate Homeland Security Committee late last month approved a subpoena along party lines for Blue Star Strategies, a consulting firm that worked for Ukrainian energy company Burisma when Biden's son Hunter served on the board. ""The public deserves to know how a guy who was vice president of the U.S. who is currently trying to be president got away with using the U.S. government to force a foreign country to stop investigating a company that was paying his son over $80,000 a month,"" said Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla. Andrew Bates, a spokesman for the Biden campaign, accused the committee's chairman, Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., of abusing his power to aid Trump. ""We're in the middle of the worst public health and economic crisis in a century,"" he said, ""and what is Senator Johnson focused on? Running a political errand for Donald Trump by wasting Homeland Security Committee time and resources attempting to resurrect a craven, previously-debunked smear against Vice President Biden."" It is the allegation at the heart of Trump's impeachment — the president wanted Ukraine to investigate alleged corruption and conspiracy theories about the Biden family. Ukraine did not, and in December 2019, Trump was impeached for abuse of power by the House of Representatives for making the ask. The Senate acquitted the president in February after a contentious trial. Senate Democrats are howling over what they say is Republicans using the Senate to try to help get Trump reelected. ""There are literally matters of life and death waiting for our committee's attention but instead this committee is doing the president's personal bidding,"" said Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., a potential contender to be Biden's running mate. During the first Judiciary Committee oversight hearing, senators will hear testimony from former Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., plans to subpoena 53 individuals, including former FBI Director James Comey, former Attorney General Loretta Lynch and former director of national intelligence James Clapper — all frequent Trump political targets. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., had generally avoided weighing in on these investigations, but he fully embraced them in a recent Senate floor speech. ""No matter what some Washington Democrats may try to claim, you are not crazy or a conspiracy theorist if you see a pattern of institutional unfairness towards this president. You would have to be blind not to see one,"" he said. Constitutional law professor Jonathan Turley, who testified against Trump's impeachment in the House, said investigations can be political and still have merit. ""I certainly believe that the oversight interests are stronger when you're looking at things like the Russia investigation. The Burisma controversy presents a more challenging question, however, I tend to favor some inquiry."" As vulnerable House Democrats experienced during impeachment, high-profile partisan inquiries can spark political backlash when voters have more urgent concerns — like the pandemic, the economy and social unrest. Graham was quick to announce last Friday that the Senate Judiciary Committee would also hold a hearing on police use of force. Democratic strategist Scott Mulhauser is a former Biden aide, and a former Senate aide. He said Senate Republicans — who are fighting to hold their majority this November — could be making a political blunder. ""It's an overreach here, an overplay of your hand with these hearings. Taking your eye off the ball is a mistake that could cost careers."" Graham says he would like to issue a committee report by October, ahead of Election Day.  Copyright 2020 NPR.

DAVIS: Today, in the Judiciary Committee, Republicans hold their first oversight hearing into the decision-making process inside the Obama-Biden administration around the FBI investigation of Trump associates during the 2016 campaign. They will hear testimony from former Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham plans to issue subpoenas for 53 individuals, including former FBI Director James Comey, former Attorney General Loretta Lynch and former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, all frequent Trump targets. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell had largely avoided weighing in on this, but he recently embraced the investigations in a floor speech. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MITCH MCCONNELL: No matter what some Washington Democrats may try to claim, you're not crazy or a conspiracy theorist if you see a pattern of institutional unfairness toward this president. You would have to be blind not to see one. DAVIS: Constitutional law professor Jonathan Turley, who testified against Trump's impeachment in the House, said investigations can be political and still have merit. JONATHAN TURLEY: I certainly believe that the oversight interests are stronger when you're looking at things like the Russian investigation. The Burisma controversy presents a more challenging question. However, I tend to favor some inquiry. DAVIS: As vulnerable House Democrats experienced during impeachment, politically loaded investigations can spark backlash when voters have more urgent concerns, like the pandemic, the economy and social unrest. Democratic strategist Scott Mulhauser is a former Biden aide. He said Senate Republicans, who are fighting to hold their majority this November, could be making a political blunder. SCOTT MULHAUSER: It's an overreach here, an overplay of your hand with these hearings - taking your eye off the ball. These are mistakes that could cost careers. DAVIS: Senator Graham says he'd like to issue a report by October, just in time for the election. Susan Davis, NPR News, Washington.

(Courtesy of the Kelly family via AP) Italia Marie Kelly One man was the beloved owner of a Louisville barbecue restaurant who provided free meals to officers. Another was a man known as “Mr. Indianapolis,” a former star football player. Yet another was a federal officer working security during a protest. They are among those killed as protests have roiled American cities in the week since the death of George Floyd, a black man who pleaded for air as a white Minneapolis officer jammed a knee into his neck. The deaths have at times been overshadowed by the shocking images of unrest, from heavy-handed police tactics to violence, vandalism and arson. Tens of thousands have marched peacefully in demonstrations against police brutality and racism. Many of the people killed were African Americans, compounding the tragedy for black communities. Dozens of others have been injured in the chaos, with police officers getting shot and protesters struck with rubber bullets. The death toll and circumstances of the killings are still being sorted out in many cities, but here is what we know so far: LOUISVILLE As police and the National Guard troops sought to clear a crowd Monday, they heard gunshots and returned fire, killing David McAtee, the owner of a barbecue restaurant. The mayor fired the police chief after finding out officers did not turn on their body-worn cameras. State police and the U.S. attorney also are investigating. McAtee was a 53-year-old African American man known for offering free meals to officers who stopped by his restaurant. “We lost a wonderful citizen named David McAtee,” Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer said. “David was a friend to many, a well-known barbecue man.” Acting police Chief Robert Schroeder said Tuesday that video from security cameras at McAtee’s business and an adjoining store showed McAtee firing a gun as officers approached. “This video does not provide all the answers. But we are releasing it to provide transparency. It does not answer every question, including why did he fire and where were police at the time he fired,” Schroeder said. The protests in Louisville have centered not just on Floyd’s killing but also the death of Breonna Taylor, a black woman killed in her home in Louisville in March. The 26-year-old EMT was shot eight times by narcotics detectives who knocked down her front door as they tried to serve a search warrant. No drugs were found. OAKLAND, CALIFORNIA A federal law enforcement officer was providing security at a federal courthouse during a protest when someone fired shots from a vehicle. Dave Patrick Underwood, 53, died and another officer was critically wounded. It was not immediately clear if the drive-by shooting was related to the protests, though the federal building’s glass doors were smashed and the front entrance was sprayed with anti-police graffiti. Underwood, who was black, and the other officer were contracted security officers employed by the Department of Homeland Security’s Federal Protective Service. They were monitoring a nearby protest. No one has been arrested, and a motive for the shooting has not yet been determined. Underwood was the brother of Angela Underwood Jacobs, recently a Republican candidate to fill a vacant U.S. congressional seat north of Los Angeles. INDIANAPOLIS Two people were killed this past weekend amid unrest, including 38-year-old Chris Beaty, a former offensive lineman for Indiana University. Beaty was known as “Mr. Indianapolis” and remained involved with the Hoosiers long after graduating. He also was a prominent businessman in the city, running multiple nightclubs. “I am at a loss for words. The news of the passing of Chris Beaty is just devastating,” coach Tom Allen said in a statement. “Since I returned home to coach at Indiana, Chris embraced me, encouraged me and supported me! His passion for life and Indiana Football energized me every time we were together.” The circumstances of his shooting weren’t immediately clear, but some media reports said it happened near his apartment. This death occurred the same night an 18-year-old man was fatally shot as protests erupted in the city. DAVENPORT, IOWA Police are investigating the deaths of 22-year-old Italia Kelly, who was shot Monday while leaving a protest outside a Walmart, and of a man found near where suspects exchanged gunfire with police in the city of 100,000 people across the Mississippi River from Illinois. The circumstances of Kelly’s death are murky, and no arrests have been made. Kelly and a friend were getting in a vehicle to leave because the protest had turned unruly when she was struck in the back by a bullet, said her aunt, Amy Hale of Atchison, Kansas. “She was always smiling, always laughing. That’s why it’s so sad that she was taken in such a violent way,” Hale said. “That is not Italia. She was the bright, bubbly big personality in the room.” Separately, authorities said an officer patrolling Sunday was “ambushed” with gunfire. Another officer shot back, and the suspects fled. Their vehicle crashed, and they were arrested. Near where the officer was shot, police found a man dead from a gunshot next to a vehicle. Police say they found a handgun underneath his body. His identity has not been released. Police said surveillance video shows that the man and some of the arrested suspects were involved in a shooting outside a jewelry store hours earlier. They were casing the business when other cars arrived and multiple people fired shots at each other and fled, police said. MINNEAPOLIS In what is believed to be the first killing since the protests broke out, Calvin L. Horton Jr. was fatally shot outside a pawn shop last week. The owner of the pawn shop, who is white, was arrested in the death of Horton, a 43-year-old black man. Police say they are investigating the circumstances of the killing, including whether it was related to protests in the neighborhood. The shop was described as having been significantly damaged during the unrest. OMAHA, NEBRASKA James Scurlock, a 22-year-old black man, was killed Saturday after authorities said he tussled with the owner of two downtown bars. Surveillance video of the strip of bars shows a group of people, including Scurlock, approach white bar owner Jake Gardner. Two people shove Gardner to the ground, and he fired shots in the air. Seconds later, Scurlock is seen jumping on Gardner, who then fires the gun over his shoulder, striking Scurlock. Authorities have declined to press charges in the death, calling the shooting self-defense. But Gardner could still face misdemeanor gun charges because his concealed carry permit for the gun had expired, the police chief said. DETROIT A 21-year-old man was killed in downtown Detroit after someone fired shots into a vehicle during a protest. According to a police report, the man was sitting in the driver’s seat of a car in a parking lot with two others when someone opened fire and then ran away. SUBURBAN CHICAGO Two people were killed during unrest Monday in the suburb of Cicero, according to a town official. Spokesman Ray Hanania did not provide details about those who were killed but said it happened during protests.",0.0

Polls began to close Tuesday night as voters navigated curfews and health concerns in a slate of primary contests that tested the nation's ability to host elections amid dueling crises and moved Joe Biden closer to formally clinching the Democratic presidential nomination. In all, nine states and the District of Columbia held elections, including four that delayed their April contests because of the coronavirus outbreak. Biden easily won Indiana, which was the first state to begin closing polls at 7 p.m. Voting continued across Washington, D.C. and Pennsylvania, two places rocked by protests following the police killing of George Floyd. The dynamic was especially intense in Washington, where Mayor Muriel Bowser imposed a 7 p.m. curfew as law enforcement agencies and National Guard troops prepared for a fifth night of social unrest near the White House. A large fence was erected in front of the White House and military vehicles blocked some streets in downtown. While voters cast ballots from Maryland to Montana, Pennsylvania offered the day's biggest trove of delegates. The state also represented a significant test case for Republicans and Democrats working to strengthen their operations in a premier general election battleground. In-person voting numbers were down in every state as many voters were encouraged to vote by mail because of the coronavirus pandemic. Yet there were reports of long lines, particularly in minority communities in the Philadelphia area, where election officials consolidated the vast majority of polling places to minimize health risks, according to Erin Kramer, executive director of One Pennsylvania. She noted that some polling places in African American communities are in police stations. ""Having to stand in line while police officers are entering and exiting the building on police business is not exactly how people want to spend their election day,"" Kramer said. Biden was on the primary ballot in almost every state in his bid to unify Democrats behind his campaign against Trump. The former vice president is already the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, given that all his rivals have dropped out of the race, but he needs to win 89% of all delegates at stake on Tuesday to formally clinch the nomination. If he doesn't secure the needed delegates Tuesday, he has other opportunities to do so this month. Biden was in Philadelphia on Tuesday morning to deliver remarks about the civil unrest that has erupted across the nation. He didn't talk about the primary, instead focusing his attention on Trump, whom Biden blasted as ""more interested in power than in principle."" Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is not actively campaigning, having suspended his operation and endorsed Biden, but his name will appear on the ballots. On the eve of Tuesday's primaries, senior adviser Jeff Weaver encouraged progressives to vote for Sanders anyway. ""People who support Bernie Sanders and his agenda, who want to maximize the influence of progressives at the convention, should cast their vote for Bernie Sanders,"" Weaver said, reminding voters that the Vermont senator is seeking leverage to shape the party's platform and rules. The comments serve as a reminder that Biden may have no legitimate Democratic rivals remaining but must still win over skeptical activists from his party's far-left flank, who worry he's too close to the political establishment. Party unity will likely be an afterthought this week, however, as more immediate health and safety concerns dominate the national conversation. The coronavirus death toll has surged past 100,000 nationwide, and thousands of new cases are reported each day. At the same time, several major cities, including some voting Tuesday, are grappling with protests. Some voters said Trump's increasingly tough tone toward protesters inspired them to participate in the democratic process. Nicholas Autiello, who works in finance in Rhode Island, said he was disturbed by police driving back peaceful demonstrators near the White House on Monday. ""Last night, we have a president who is acting like a dictator,"" Autiello said. ""So being able to come out here this morning and fill in a circle next to a name for someone who I know will restore honor and decency to the presidency was so important."" In Washington, the mayor ordered a 7 p.m. curfew, though voting places will be open until 8 p.m. Voting has been deemed essential, and city officials say voters will not be subject to arrest if they cast ballots during the curfew. Philadelphia moved its 6 p.m. curfew back to 8:30 p.m. for Tuesday to accommodate voting. ""We are in unique times, and voting is a unique challenge for people,"" said Josh Schwerin, chief strategist for the pro-Democrat super PAC Priorities USA. He said that his organization and others will be watching closely on Tuesday ""to see how well it works, where issues are and where obstacles have been put in place."" Political groups have had to adjust as some states move to a system that relies largely on voting by mail. They include Montana, where all 56 counties decided to vote entirely by mail. Voting rights watchdogs in multiple states have expressed concerns about access to mail ballots, confusion about deadlines and a shortage of poll workers that could lead to long lines. Those voting Tuesday include the District of Columbia, Indiana, Maryland, Montana, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and South Dakota.

Polls began to close Tuesday night as voters navigated curfews and health concerns in a slate of primary contests that tested the nation's ability to host elections amid dueling crises and moved Joe Biden closer to formally clinching the Democratic presidential nomination. In all, nine states and the District of Columbia held elections, including four that delayed their April contests because of the coronavirus outbreak. Biden easily won Indiana, which was the first state to begin closing polls at 7 p.m. Voting continued across Washington, D.C. and Pennsylvania, two places rocked by protests following the police killing of George Floyd. The dynamic was especially intense in Washington, where Mayor Muriel Bowser imposed a 7 p.m. curfew as law enforcement agencies and National Guard troops prepared for a fifth night of social unrest near the White House. A large fence was erected in front of the White House and military vehicles blocked some streets in downtown. While voters cast ballots from Maryland to Montana, Pennsylvania offered the day's biggest trove of delegates. The state also represented a significant test case for Republicans and Democrats working to strengthen their operations in a premier general election battleground. In-person voting numbers were down in every state as many voters were encouraged to vote by mail because of the coronavirus pandemic. Yet there were reports of long lines, particularly in minority communities in the Philadelphia area, where election officials consolidated the vast majority of polling places to minimize health risks, according to Erin Kramer, executive director of One Pennsylvania. She noted that some polling places in African American communities are in police stations. ""Having to stand in line while police officers are entering and exiting the building on police business is not exactly how people want to spend their election day,"" Kramer said.

Black Lives Matter of Manchester helped organize the peaceful demonstration, which gathered in Veterans Park. NHPR's All Things Considered host Peter Biello interviewed Ronelle Tshiela, a local organizer who spoke Saturday in New Hampshire's largest city. Listen to the broadcast version of Peter Biello's interview with Ronelle Tshiela. (Below is a lightly edited transcript of the interview.) ""So this does not stop here. It is not just about coming to the park to march. It is not just about posting Instagram pictures after this. It is not just about making cute signs. When you go, vote in November ..."" That's the sound of Ronelle Tshiela, one of the organizers of the Black Lives Matter movement in Manchester. She's with me now. Thank you very much for speaking with me. Thank you for having me. I really appreciate that. So let's talk about how Saturday went from your perspective. What was noteworthy about the protest and the crowd that attended it? It was really great. It was really powerful. It went a lot better than we had expected it to. You know, we did something just like this in 2016. We had a good turnout. However, this turnout exceeded our expectations and it was amazing. I was happy that the protests stayed peaceful. And I think one of the most powerful things is having a speak and having other people speak and hearing the voices of black people in New Hampshire and in our communities and having people actually listen to us. And you helped start Black Lives Matter in Manchester when you were in high school, right? Yes, I was a junior in high school. I was a rising senior. And what led you to start the group then? You know, as young people, we were extremely tired of waiting for people, you know, older than us to mobilize and start things. And we realized that it was up to us to have a voice and we had a duty in our community and in this country to be a voice for young black people and black people in general. And so one day we just decided that, you know, we were tired of hearing about things and we wanted to take action and make our voices heard. So what feels different about this moment in New Hampshire now? I think more people are waking up, you know, like at the time when we received a lot of support. But we also, of course, received a lot of opposition. And it definitely feels that we are becoming more united. But at the same time, you can feel that people are becoming more tired and we're exhausted. You know, we don't want to hear about this. We don't have. We don't want to have to march. You know what I mean? And people are becoming tired of that becoming a normal thing. You know what I mean? And so, yeah, I think that's definitely it's definitely a different atmosphere, although there are there are some parallels. But at the same time, things have changed a little bit in that way. What are you hoping will come out of this? I'm hoping that this part of the movement sparks change, you know. A lot of people think that we don't really have a problem with racism and prejudice and things like that here in the state of New Hampshire or even at all. And so I'm hoping that we not only get people to listen, but we promote people to, you know, fight with us and stand with us. And change actually comes from it. We've seen images from around the country of protesters confronting the police. How would you describe the relationship between Black Lives Matter and the Manchester Police Department? We've created a relationship with the police in order to make sure that people in Manchester are able to freely exercise their right to free speech and be safe about it. There are a lot of people in Manchester who have animosity towards the Manchester police and us as well. We have different stories that we can tell about encounters with the Manchester police, you know, but I think it's important for us to work together with people who are actually willing and in a position to help us create change. And do you get the sense that the Manchester Police Department is willing to work with you and help create change? At this time, yes. This is the second police administration that we have worked with. Former police chief Willard was very willing to do things and help us create change and work with us. We just recently spoke with the new Manchester police chief and as well as the other men and women on the force. We think that a lot of them are with us. Obviously, they are going to be some people who are opposed to us and maybe are not willing to work with us. But I think that we owe it to ourselves and to everybody else to try to create that relationship and bridge that gap in order to create change. Your speech in Veterans Park at the protest included a call to vote. Can you talk a little bit about what this year's elections mean to you and what's at stake for Black Lives Matter? I think it means a lot to me. You know, I was really disappointed in 2016. You know, I was a high school student. I couldn't even vote. But I was still very politically active. And I decided to come to the University of New Hampshire to study political science, to figure out why things happen, what works, what doesn't work, and how we can really create change throughout through the political system. And I think a lot is at stake for us in our movement and people of color and specifically black people in this country. I feel like our current administration has perpetuated narratives that make it OK for people to be racist and discriminatory and prejudiced. And I think that if we don't act and if we don't get out there and go to the polls in November, then we risk being silent and we risk more black lives being lost. We risk our country becoming complacent and we risk everyone being okay with the current atmosphere in this country in regards to race.",0.0

We will not support a platform that incites violence, racism and lives hashtag black lives matter. Frank told CNBC the companies were in final negotiations on a six figure content partnership is at his company would have netted hundreds of thousands of dollars in the deal, which would have provided free therapy to some users. But Frank said he'd be willing to reopen discussions if Facebook improved its methods for moderating content. In the wake of the protests surrounding George Floyd's death, Trump shared a post saying. When the looting starts, the shooting starts. Twitter added labels saying it violated Twitter's rules about glorifying violence and move. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg openly disagreed with telling Fox News. I just believe strongly that Facebook shouldn't be the arbitrator of truth of everything that people say online. On Monday, there was a virtual walk out among Facebook employees who felt Trump's post violated their platform standards Advertisement Tensions rise among Facebook staff as Mark Zuckerberg gives explanation for inaction on President Trump posts Share Shares Copy Link Copy Video above: Facebook loses deal over its reaction to trump ‘looting’ post, employees stage virtual walkoutFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg sought Tuesday to ease employee outrage over his inaction on incendiary remarks recently posted by President Donald Trump.During a company-wide town hall, Zuckerberg struggled to explain his decision-making process as many of his employees, using a real-time feedback tool, reminded him of promises to remove content that calls for violence or that could lead to imminent physical harm.""It's crystal clear today that leadership refuses to stand with us,"" Brandon Dail, an engineer at Facebook, tweeted as the town hall was taking place.Facebook spokesman Andy Stone said in a statement to CNN Business that open and honest discussion ""has always been a part of Facebook's culture.""""Mark had an open discussion with employees today, as he has regularly over the years,"" Stone said. ""He's grateful for their feedback.""The meeting has threatened to ratchet up tensions at Facebook, which has been hit with allegations of right-wing bias from conservatives and criticized by others for tacitly condoning the spread of hate and racism.Another Facebook employee told CNN Business they found Zuckerberg's answers to staff questions at the town hall lacking, and said the CEO risked alienating more of his staff rather than addressing their concerns.During the event, Facebook staff shared links to a video of an exchange between Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Zuckerberg last October when he said: ""If anyone, including a politician, is saying things that can cause, that is calling for violence or could risk imminent physical harm ... we will take that content down.""At one point, roughly 22,000 people had tuned into the live video feed, according to another Facebook worker who was watching the stream. The figure reflects nearly half of the company's 48,000 employees.The top question for Zuckerberg, which called for changes to the company's stance on political speech, received more than 5,400 votes from workers, the employee said.Not all employees disagree with Zuckerberg's position, however. One told CNN Business, ""Supporting free speech - especially when you vehemently disagree with what the person is saying - is a hard but important stance needed to make sure everyone can have a voice.""The employee said it is hard to be sure what portion of Facebook's staff supports Zuckerberg's decision. At least a few people with whom they have spoken do support it but are nervous to say so more publicly because they have seen the pushback within the company, the employee said.Tuesday's event follows days of employee activism over Facebook's handling of Trump's content.Some staffers staged a virtual walkout on Monday to protest decisions made by the company's leaders concerning posts by Trump. And at least one worker, software engineer Timothy Aveni, has quit his job, saying it is no longer feasible to ""keep excusing Facebook's behavior.""Facebook's workforce is known for keeping its disputes with executives largely private. But that changed on Friday, when Zuckerberg announced he would not act against content by Trump that Twitter had flagged earlier as having violated its own rules. The decision has prompted widespread criticism within Facebook that has spilled into public, with numerous employees expressing their disagreement on Twitter.One of Trump's posts had claimed, in reference to the demonstrations in Minneapolis, that ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts"" — a phrase with racist origins. Trump later professed not to know the history of the phrase, but he allowed the original remark to stand on Facebook and Twitter.Zuckerberg said the content provoked in him a ""visceral negative reaction."" But he justified his decision not to act against the posts, citing his responsibility as the ""leader of an institution committed to free expression.""In the eyes of his harshest internal critics, Zuckerberg had simply caved on prior principled commitments.""Mark can patch this one section of Facebook's policies, but if he derives his principle from the particular actions he wants to take, instead of taking action based on principle, it'll be fruitless in the long run,"" Aveni said in response to a CNN reporter's question on his post.",0.0

D’Laly’s Beauty Salon is across from Franklin Park in Roxbury, the location of Tuesday’s protest. Montero boarded up the shop to protect all the renovations she just completed while being closed because of Covid-19. “I want to be able to come back tomorrow and everything is fine,” said Montero. Kaleisha Chance’s dance studio is also across from the park. “I hope the message stays positive,” said Kaleisha Chance. She didn’t board up, instead, she’s put pictures of her dancers in the window. “They’re black dancers, they’re dancers of the community and hopefully people see that and that will turn them away,” said Chance. An entire shopping plaza on Blue Hill Ave in Roxbury is boarded and businesses had to spray paint the fact that they’re still open. “If it needs to be boarded up it needs to be boarded up I just hope people hear the message and get the message,” said one shopper. “I am not for the violence the stores have nothing to do with that,” said Ruth Bodden. Small business owners and people in the community were hoping for a peaceful night. “I think everyone has the right to protest, but if you do it in a peaceful way it’s better for everybody,” said Montero.

Floyd died after being restrained by Minneapolis police officers on Memorial Day. (AP Photo/Frank Franklin II) Frank Franklin II For Rogers Johnson, turning back the clock was easy. He laughed and used a wonderful play on words, crisp and revealing in their simplicity, attributed to Hall of Fame catcher Yogi Berra. “First things first,” the leader of the N.H. NAACP said by phone. “I was a product of the ’60s, so this is déjà vu all over again.” Turn on the TV, read the newspapers, go online. Cops and citizens are fighting each other, all over the country, in major cities. Racial disharmony is exploding off the charts. We’ve seen it before in recent years, the match and the fuse, then ensuing violence. This time the black man’s name was George Floyd, whose death at the hands of police in Minnesota is yet another watershed moment in the history of race relations in this country. If you’re old enough to remember the 1960s, or if you’ve read about it and seen those black-and-white photos from that era, you know African Americans were attacked by police dogs, beaten with clubs and sprayed with howitzer-like hoses. Today? Police wearing riot gear are shooting tear gas and rubber bullets into crowds gathering across the country since Floyd’s death. Some were rowdy and needed to be reeled in during stressful conditions. Others simply wanted respect, equal opportunities and the ability to drive to the corner market without being terrified. “We want to make people aware that this is not unusual,” Johnson said, referring to Floyd’s death. “This is something that has occurred in everyday life in the black community, and that is how we handle things in America.” Johnson saw both sides, the part about displaying justified anger – shortly after moments like Dr. King’s assassination in 1968 and Floyd’s death last month – and crossing a line that pushes this important matter to the background. “Violence obscures the message,” Johnson said. “And you want a message that black people are concerned about just driving down the road and getting pulled over. You never know what’s going to happen.” Rogers is a black man whose résumé of leadership and fighting discrimination sparkles. He grew up in a Westchester suburb of New York City. He and his brothers were great high school athletes, and there were plenty of African Americans around to play sandlot and organized ball. And guess what? Someone forgot to tell the kids in Johnson’s neighborhood that black and white don’t mix. “No racial discrimination,” Rogers said. “We played at everyone’s house, pool hopping in each neighborhood. We went to Rye Playland and the beach and Yankee Stadium and Shea Stadium. No one bothered anyone. It was magnificent.” Janice M. Alberghene of Dover is 71. Her résumé is busting at the seams as well. She’s an author and a doctor of philosophy. She protested against the Vietnam War, but her mind flashed back to the 1960s and the other mayhem of the day. In fact, her Facebook page says this: “Our cities burned in the 1960s; racism, poverty, the war in Vietnam. Year 2020. Our cities burn; racism, poverty, and the higher rates of COVID-19 that result. I’ve never been more angered by every ‘non-racist’ white person who stays silent. I don’t acquit myself of this crime, but I can sure as hell tell you that speaking up and acting up is everybody’s job.” Alberghene’s radar is forever on high alert when tension like this explodes. She’s white. So’s her husband, Sen. David Watters, a Democrat from Dover, who teaches African American literature and history at the University of New Hampshire. Their son? He’s a professional ballet dancer in Houston. He’s adopted. He’s black. Alberghene was affable throughout our talk, but she admitted she grows upset when people look to her for answers, simply because of the color of her son’s skin. “It’s the responsibility of all of us if we hear or see someone doing something that’s racist,” she said. African Americans I spoke to said the same thing, that they’ve grown weary and impatient and can understand why people got mad, while knowing that the destruction of businesses is not the way to go. Johnson said he saw two types of protesters, then and now. The 1960s, he said, was cleaner at its heart. “The riots of the ’60s and ’70s,” he said, “were a result of frustration with the lack of progress with race relations as a whole. Today’s riots are the results of people taking advantage of situations conducive of turmoil and not a reaction to racial injustice.” No matter how you slice it, of course, the core issue remains the same. We’re not there yet. Perhaps we should listen to a pair of young adults. Maybe their perspective will inspire us to make changes. Tyrell Whitted of Manchester is a black psychology major at the University of New Hampshire. He’s 24, far too young to remember the old days, but he’s analyzed both eras and said that what’s happening today is a rebirth of sorts from the ’60s. He was slated to attend a rally on Tuesday night at Stark Park in Manchester to promote peaceful protesting. He wants to be a leader for change and believes his generation will get it done. “It’s almost like the second wave of civil rights,” Whitted told me. “All over the country people are getting violent and the police are getting angry. We’re constantly being shown images of police brutality and racism. It seems to be constant, and we are going to break that cycle.” Marcus Boggis is the 34-year-old son of Jerrianne Boggis, the head of the Portsmouth Black Heritage Trail. She’s also on the board of the N.H. Civil Rights Commission. Her son is an ‘IT’ guy living in Quincy, Mass. He knows the ’60s through reading and once thought that that era would evolve into something special, full of tolerance and color-blindness.

(Courtesy of the Kelly family via AP) Italia Marie Kelly One man was the beloved owner of a Louisville barbecue restaurant who provided free meals to officers. Another was a man known as “Mr. Indianapolis,” a former star football player. Yet another was a federal officer working security during a protest. They are among those killed as protests have roiled American cities in the week since the death of George Floyd, a black man who pleaded for air as a white Minneapolis officer jammed a knee into his neck. The deaths have at times been overshadowed by the shocking images of unrest, from heavy-handed police tactics to violence, vandalism and arson. Tens of thousands have marched peacefully in demonstrations against police brutality and racism. Many of the people killed were African Americans, compounding the tragedy for black communities. Dozens of others have been injured in the chaos, with police officers getting shot and protesters struck with rubber bullets. The death toll and circumstances of the killings are still being sorted out in many cities, but here is what we know so far: LOUISVILLE As police and the National Guard troops sought to clear a crowd Monday, they heard gunshots and returned fire, killing David McAtee, the owner of a barbecue restaurant. The mayor fired the police chief after finding out officers did not turn on their body-worn cameras. State police and the U.S. attorney also are investigating. McAtee was a 53-year-old African American man known for offering free meals to officers who stopped by his restaurant. “We lost a wonderful citizen named David McAtee,” Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer said. “David was a friend to many, a well-known barbecue man.” Acting police Chief Robert Schroeder said Tuesday that video from security cameras at McAtee’s business and an adjoining store showed McAtee firing a gun as officers approached. “This video does not provide all the answers. But we are releasing it to provide transparency. It does not answer every question, including why did he fire and where were police at the time he fired,” Schroeder said. The protests in Louisville have centered not just on Floyd’s killing but also the death of Breonna Taylor, a black woman killed in her home in Louisville in March. The 26-year-old EMT was shot eight times by narcotics detectives who knocked down her front door as they tried to serve a search warrant. No drugs were found. OAKLAND, CALIFORNIA A federal law enforcement officer was providing security at a federal courthouse during a protest when someone fired shots from a vehicle. Dave Patrick Underwood, 53, died and another officer was critically wounded. It was not immediately clear if the drive-by shooting was related to the protests, though the federal building’s glass doors were smashed and the front entrance was sprayed with anti-police graffiti. Underwood, who was black, and the other officer were contracted security officers employed by the Department of Homeland Security’s Federal Protective Service. They were monitoring a nearby protest. No one has been arrested, and a motive for the shooting has not yet been determined. Underwood was the brother of Angela Underwood Jacobs, recently a Republican candidate to fill a vacant U.S. congressional seat north of Los Angeles. INDIANAPOLIS Two people were killed this past weekend amid unrest, including 38-year-old Chris Beaty, a former offensive lineman for Indiana University. Beaty was known as “Mr. Indianapolis” and remained involved with the Hoosiers long after graduating. He also was a prominent businessman in the city, running multiple nightclubs. “I am at a loss for words. The news of the passing of Chris Beaty is just devastating,” coach Tom Allen said in a statement. “Since I returned home to coach at Indiana, Chris embraced me, encouraged me and supported me! His passion for life and Indiana Football energized me every time we were together.” The circumstances of his shooting weren’t immediately clear, but some media reports said it happened near his apartment. This death occurred the same night an 18-year-old man was fatally shot as protests erupted in the city. DAVENPORT, IOWA Police are investigating the deaths of 22-year-old Italia Kelly, who was shot Monday while leaving a protest outside a Walmart, and of a man found near where suspects exchanged gunfire with police in the city of 100,000 people across the Mississippi River from Illinois. The circumstances of Kelly’s death are murky, and no arrests have been made. Kelly and a friend were getting in a vehicle to leave because the protest had turned unruly when she was struck in the back by a bullet, said her aunt, Amy Hale of Atchison, Kansas. “She was always smiling, always laughing. That’s why it’s so sad that she was taken in such a violent way,” Hale said. “That is not Italia. She was the bright, bubbly big personality in the room.” Separately, authorities said an officer patrolling Sunday was “ambushed” with gunfire. Another officer shot back, and the suspects fled. Their vehicle crashed, and they were arrested. Near where the officer was shot, police found a man dead from a gunshot next to a vehicle. Police say they found a handgun underneath his body. His identity has not been released. Police said surveillance video shows that the man and some of the arrested suspects were involved in a shooting outside a jewelry store hours earlier. They were casing the business when other cars arrived and multiple people fired shots at each other and fled, police said. MINNEAPOLIS In what is believed to be the first killing since the protests broke out, Calvin L. Horton Jr. was fatally shot outside a pawn shop last week. The owner of the pawn shop, who is white, was arrested in the death of Horton, a 43-year-old black man. Police say they are investigating the circumstances of the killing, including whether it was related to protests in the neighborhood. The shop was described as having been significantly damaged during the unrest. OMAHA, NEBRASKA James Scurlock, a 22-year-old black man, was killed Saturday after authorities said he tussled with the owner of two downtown bars. Surveillance video of the strip of bars shows a group of people, including Scurlock, approach white bar owner Jake Gardner. Two people shove Gardner to the ground, and he fired shots in the air. Seconds later, Scurlock is seen jumping on Gardner, who then fires the gun over his shoulder, striking Scurlock. Authorities have declined to press charges in the death, calling the shooting self-defense. But Gardner could still face misdemeanor gun charges because his concealed carry permit for the gun had expired, the police chief said. DETROIT A 21-year-old man was killed in downtown Detroit after someone fired shots into a vehicle during a protest. According to a police report, the man was sitting in the driver’s seat of a car in a parking lot with two others when someone opened fire and then ran away.

While Floyd’s death filled him with rage, Ojeleye says that now is the time to peacefully come together to fix what is wrong in this country. “It’s disturbing when you see that type of thing happening. The root of it is hate. When you see someone snuffing out someone else’s life, it goes deeper than even race,” Ojeleye told WBZ-TV’s Steve Burton. “Hate is a powerful thing and it’s bleeding into our society right now and causing a lot of disturbance throughout the entire country.” Ojeleye is disappointed to see the peaceful protests turn into riots and looting, and is asking those participating in such acts to stop. “We cannot become the hate we are trying to eradicate. Right now we’re upset and angry, and rightfully so. We’ve seen things we can’t un-see that are going to keep us up at night. Especially as a black man in society, it goes back to all the of former instances that we’ve seen. All the way from Rodney King, Eric Garner to right now. It’s something that is going to take time to change, but as a nation and as a people, we can’t let that hate become what drives us,” he said. “If we allow looting to be our response, then you become the people out there hurting others.” Ojeleye says police officers need to do a better job opening a dialogue with the black community, but added that it goes both ways. Not every cop is bad, and people need to show them respect as well. “As people, we don’t know how to communicate with them. They’re the ones we look to, and if we could just communicate with them in a better way – whether that’s how they train or in a case-by-case basis – that will make everyone feel safer. It will take time to rebuild that trust,” he said. “We need to give them the respect they deserve. Their job is to protect us,” he added. “Sometimes they may not do that given the situation, but they are in authority over us trying to protect us. They do the right thing more often than they don’t, but when they don’t the consequences are huge. There needs to be accountability.” Ojeleye said his faith has taught him that the best way to fight hatred is with love. “It sounds idealistic and it might be a tough thing to even fathom, when you see such hate out there, but that’s the only way to change it. If we fight hate with hate, we all lose,” he said. Much like head coach Brad Stevens, Ojeleye was proud to see his Celtics teammates leading the charge in protests over the weekend. He applauded Jaylen Brown for leading a protest in Atlanta on Saturday, and Marcus Smart, Enes Kanter and Vincent Poirier for lending their voices in Boston on Sunday. “JB is a leader,” he said of Brown. “The way he organized that, the way he stepped up to the call right away is big time. Enes, Vincent, Marcus were at the protest and answered the call as well. We have to all use our voice, stand for it and let people know where we stand on it and how we want justice.” Ojeleye hopes that using his status as an athlete now will help people realize he is much more than just a basketball player. “I want people to see me as a person, not even an athlete. My career is going to be temporary. We all as athletes, especially during this time, we have to show we’re more than that,” he said. “During this time or racism and injustice, we have our voice and out platforms, and there’s no better time speak up to tell people we want equality, and how together, through unity, we can change this.”",0.0

Leading the event were Palana Belken, Rochester City Councilor, and Emmett Soldati, owner of Teatotaller cafe in Somersworth and candidate for the New Hampshire Executive Council District 2 seat. The event was attended by Pride event organizers across the state, GLSEN, Stonewall Democrats, several drag performers and elected leaders, among others, according to organizers. The agenda began with a moment of silence for social justice and Black Lives Matter and proceeded to a “Pride Roll Call” - an opportunity for leaders of Pride organizations to each talk about how they are planning to celebrate Pride amid the coronavirus pandemic. Palana said, “The biggest takeaway from this call was that people were talking about the need for statewide activation beyond what each community is doing.” Soldait said, “In Massachusetts and Maine for example, there are statewide Pride organizations but unfortunately that does not exist in New Hampshire. The silver lining here is that because of COVID and the fact that we are meeting in a Pride Town Hall on Zoom, we are connecting with people from Claremont and Conway and elsewhere who we might not have met in our own bubble. As a result, we can see the goal of using Pride Town Hall and this technology to build the infrastructure for statewide planning.” Soldait announced the launch of his LGBTQ+ Coalition to advise his campaign and amplify LGBTQ+ concerns. More than 25 leaders, activists and performers from across the state have thus far announced their participation in the coalition, which will be chaired by Belken. Belken explained the idea behind the unique Town Hall. “As we discussed the topic of how will each of us observe Pride Month this year, we reflected on how LGBTQ Pride celebrations have come a long way, from their origins as a riot against anti-LGBTQ ordinances and police abuse at the Stonewall Inn, to a worldwide celebration of the progress made in the 51 years since,” Belken said. “There were six Pride festivals scheduled to take place across New Hampshire this month - but with large gatherings on hold for the time being, we felt it urgent to gather folks from across the state to hold space together and share how we'll each be rising to the occasion for Pride 2020.”",0.0

(AP Photo/Michel Euler) Michel Euler PARIS — Thousands of French protesters defied a virus-related police ban and rallied Tuesday against racial injustice and heavy-handed police tactics, as global outrage over what happened to George Floyd in the United States kindled frustrations across borders and continents. Clapping, cheering and waving signs reading “Black Lives Matter” and “Police Everywhere, Justice Nowhere,” the largely young, multiracial crowd streamed to the main Paris courthouse and rallied peacefully while police monitored closely from nearby corners. Earlier, thousands marched in Sydney, Australia’s largest city, chanting “I can’t breathe,” and expressions of anger erupted in multiple languages on social networks, with thousands of Swedes joining an online protest and others speaking out under the banner of #BlackOutTuesday. Diplomatic ire percolated too, with the European Union’s top foreign policy official saying the bloc was “shocked and appalled” by Floyd’s death. As protests escalated worldwide, solidarity with U.S. demonstrators increasingly mixed with local worries. “When you refuse to treat the problem of racism … it leads to what we see in the United States,” said Dominique Sopo, head of French activist group SOS Racisme. “The case of George Floyd echoes what we fear in France.” Floyd died last week after a police officer pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes even after he stopped moving and pleading for air. The death set off protests that spread across America — and now, beyond. Fears of the coronavirus remain close to the surface and were the reason cited by the police for banning Tuesday’s protest at the main Paris courthouse. Gatherings of more than 10 people remain banned in France as part of virus confinement measures. But the Paris protest plans drew attention online, and demonstrators showed up anyway. Similar demonstrations were held in other French cities in honor of Adama Traore, who died shortly after his arrest in 2016, and in solidarity with Americans demonstrating against Floyd’s death. The Traore case has become emblematic of the fight against police brutality in France. The circumstances of the death of the 24-year-old Frenchman of Malian origin are still under investigation after four years of conflicting medical reports about what happened. The lawyer for two of the three police officers involved in the arrest, Rodolphe Bosselut, said the Floyd and Traore cases “have strictly nothing to do with each other.” Bosselut told The Associated Press that Traore’s death wasn’t linked with the conditions of his arrest but other factors, including a pre-existing medical condition. Traore’s family says he died from asphyxiation because of police tactics — and that his last words were “I can’t breathe.” “I can’t breathe” were also the final words of David Dungay, a 26-year-old Aboriginal man who died in a Sydney prison in 2015 while being restrained by five guards. As 3,000 people marched peacefully through Sydney, many said they had been inspired by a mixture of sympathy for African Americans amid ongoing violent protests in the U.S. and to call for change in Australia’s treatment of its indigenous population, particularly involving police. The mostly Australian crowd at the authorized demonstration also included protesters from the U.S. and elsewhere. “I’m here for my people, and for our fallen brothers and sisters around the world,” said Sydney indigenous woman Amanda Hill, 46, who attended the rally with her daughter and two nieces. “What’s happening in America shines a light on the situation here. It doesn’t matter if it’s about the treatment of black men and women from here or from another country; enough is enough,” she said. A total of 432 indigenous Australians have died in police detention since a 1991 Royal Commission — Australia’s highest level of official inquiry — into Aboriginal deaths in custody, according to The Guardian newspaper. Australia has also never signed a treaty with the country’s indigenous population, who suffer higher-than-average rates of infant mortality and poor health, plus shorter life expectancy and lower levels of education and employment than white Australians. Another protest was planned Tuesday in the Dutch capital The Hague, and more than 6,000 people attended a Sweden-organized online protest to express support with the Black Lives Matter movement. Among speakers was Aysha Jones, a Gambia-born and Sweden-based activist and fashion blogger. Jones said the protest was important to show support to people in America, but also to remind Swedes that racism “does exist here, it’s very real and people are being harmed from it.” More protests in various countries are planned later in the week, including a string of demonstrations in front of U.S. embassies on Saturday. The drama unfolding in the U.S. drew increasing diplomatic concern. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell’s remarks in Brussels were the strongest to come out of the 27-nation bloc, saying Floyd’s death was a result of an abuse of power. Borrell told reporters that “like the people of the United States, we are shocked and appalled by the death of George Floyd.” He underlined that Europeans “support the right to peaceful protest, and also we condemn violence and racism of any kind, and for sure, we call for a de-escalation of tensions.” German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said peaceful protests in the U.S. following Floyd’s death are “understandable and more than legitimate.” “I can only express my hope that the peaceful protests do not continue to lead to violence, but even more express the hope that these protests have an effect in the United States,” Maas said. More African leaders are speaking up over the killing of Floyd. “It cannot be right that, in the 21st century, the United States, this great bastion of democracy, continues to grapple with the problem of systemic racism,” Ghana President Nana Akufo-Addo said in a statement, adding that black people the world over are shocked and distraught. Kenyan opposition leader and former Prime Minister Raila Odinga offered a prayer for the U.S., “that there be justice and freedom for all human beings who call America their country.” Like some in Africa who have spoken out, Odinga also noted troubles at home, saying the judging of people by character instead of skin color “is a dream we in Africa, too, owe our citizens.”",0.0

(AP Photo/Yuki Iwamura) Yuki Iwamura Protesters gather at Foley Square in New York on Tuesday as part of a demonstration to protest the death of George Floyd, who died May 25 in Minneapolis. AP — Yuki Iwamura WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump on Tuesday turned up the pressure on governors to quell the violence set off by the death of George Floyd, demanding New York call up the National Guard to stop the “lowlifes and losers.” As cities around the U.S. witnessed a seventh straight night of both peaceful demonstrations and bursts of theft, vandalism and attacks on police, the president amplified his hard-line calls of a day earlier, in which he threatened to send in the military to restore order if governors didn’t do it. “NYC, CALL UP THE NATIONAL GUARD,” he tweeted. “The lowlifes and losers are ripping you apart. Act fast! Don’t make the same horrible and deadly mistake you made with the Nursing Homes!!!” In New York on Monday night, people smashed shop windows near Rockefeller Center and breached the doors of Macy’s flagship store on 34th Street despite the first curfew in the city in decades. Police said nearly 700 people were arrested and several officers injured in the overnight violence. New York and other cities braced for more trouble after nightfall Tuesday, with Mayor Bill de Blasio extending an 8 p.m. curfew all week. “We’re going to have a tough few days,” he warned, but added: “We’re going to beat it back.” He said he would do that with the help of community leaders, urging them to step forward: “Create peace. … Stand up.” More than 20,000 National Guard members have been called up in 29 states to deal with the violence. New York is not among them. De Blasio has said he does not want the Guard, and Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo has said he will not send it into the city against the mayor’s wishes. During the violence that gripped communities from coast to coast again on Monday night, police officers were shot, run over and showered with rocks and bottles. In Atlanta, police fired tear gas at demonstrators. In Nashville, more than 60 National Guard members put down their riot shields at the request of peaceful protesters. And at a demonstration in Buffalo, N.Y., an SUV plowed into a group of officers, injuring three. An officer was shot and gravely wounded as police tried to disperse a crowd outside a Las Vegas hotel and casino. Four officers were shot in St. Louis; they were expected to recover. “We have been sitting on a powder keg for some time and it has burst,” Philadelphia Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw said. In Philadelphia, where hundreds of protesters spilled onto a highway in the heart of the city, Mayor Jim Kenney described a chaotic night in which one person was killed attempting to use explosives to open an ATM, a gun shop owner fatally shot a would-be thief, and a 19-year-old died of injuries during looting. About a dozen other deaths have been reported around the country over the past week. Some protesters framed the burgeoning movement as a necessity after a string of killings by police. “I fear for my safety every time I get in the car to go for a drive. I fear of getting pulled over. I fear for all 10 of my brothers’ and sisters’ lives, for my parents’ lives!” 19-year-old Amari Burroughs of Parkland, Fla., said Tuesday as she prepared for another protest. “My goal is to use my voice and my leadership to make this world safer so that one day I can bring children here and won’t have to fear for their safety.” Outside the Minnesota Capitol in St. Paul, where a youth protest was held Tuesday, 18-year-old Joseph Tawah agreed. “It’s really hard not to feel afraid,” he said. More than 5,600 people nationwide have been arrested over the past week for such offenses as stealing, blocking highways and breaking curfew, according to a count by The Associated Press. In Richmond, Va., several hundred people gathered outside City Hall on Tuesday, shouting down Mayor Levar Stoney, who apologized for police lobbing tear gas at peaceful demonstrators. “Where were you last night when we were being tear-gassed?” a woman yelled. “Where were you? Where were you? Where were you?” the crowd chanted. Meanwhile, Democratic governors and mayors rejected Trump’s threat to send in the military, questioning whether the federal government has such authority and warning that such a step would be incendiary. De Blasio said military troops would create “a dangerous scenario,” while Colorado Gov. Jared Polis and Denver Mayor Michael Hancock likewise warned such a move would just lead to more violence and destruction. “Denver is not Little Rock in 1957, and Donald Trump is not President Eisenhower. This is a time for healing, for bringing people together, and the best way to protect civil rights is to move away from escalating violence,” they said in a statement, referring to Eisenhower’s use of troops to enforce school desegregation in the South. Even some in the president’s own party rebuffed the idea, including Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee, who said his state has what it needs. “The military is here to protect and defend this country. We don’t have that need here in this state,” he said. A senior White House official said Tuesday that despite Trump’s threats, the goal was to pressure governors to deploy more National Guard members. The president is not rushing to use the Insurrection Act to send in the military, according to the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The unrest in Minneapolis, meanwhile, appeared to stabilize on the same day Floyd’s brother made an impassioned plea for peace at the spot where a white police officer, Derek Chauvin, put his knee on the handcuffed black man’s neck for several minutes, even after he stopped moving and pleading for air. Chauvin has been charged with murder. Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said Tuesday that prosecutors were working as fast as they can to determine if the three other officers at the scene should be charged too. All four have been fired. Floyd’s family was expected to join a march in Houston on Tuesday. The state of Minnesota opened an investigation into whether the Minneapolis Police Department has a pattern of discrimination against minorities. Cities struggled to keep police in line and avoid instances of excessive force. The police chief in Louisville, Ky., was fired after a restaurant owner was killed by police and National Guard members enforcing a curfew. In Richmond, the police chief said officers who used tear gas on a group of peaceful protesters would be disciplined. In Atlanta, six officers were charged Tuesday after a video showed authorities dragging two young people from a car during protests. Sending the military into the states would mark a stunning federal intervention rarely seen in modern American history. It drew comparisons to 1968, when Richard Nixon ran as the law-and-order candidate in the aftermath of riots following the assassination of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. Federal law allows presidents to dispatch the military into states to suppress an insurrection or if a state is defying federal law, legal experts said. But some state officials asserted that the president does not have a unilateral right to send in troops against the will of local governments.",0.0

The incident, during which officers used stun guns on the pair and pulled them from their vehicle, received national attention after bystanders recorded and posted video to social media. ""I agree with Mayor [Keisha Lance] Bottoms and I agree with our police chief, Erika Shields, when they both have conveyed in so many separate ways that the conduct in this incident — it is not indicative of the way that we treat people in the city of Atlanta,"" Fulton County, Ga., District Attorney Paul Howard told reporters Tuesday. Howard's office has filed charges — mostly assorted aggravated assault and battery counts — against a half-dozen officers involved in the arrest: Lonnie Hood, Willie Sauls, Ivory Streeter, Mark Gardner, Armond Jones and Roland Claud. Streeter and Gardner have been fired from the force since Saturday's confrontation, while three others have been placed on desk duty. Howard said the charges are backed up by extensive interviews with the young couple, Taniyah Pilgrim and Messiah Young, as well as video evidence from bystanders and the officers' body camera footage. The district attorney played one such video from a bodycam. During the video, officers on foot confront Pilgrim and Young, who had been passing them in a car. After the two black occupants appear to drive away briefly from the officers, Pilgrim and Young stop — at which point the officers swarm the vehicle. Stun guns are used on both occupants, who are ripped from the car over Pilgrim's screams to stop. Pilgrim was never charged; Young was charged with attempting to elude officers before the charge was dismissed at the request of the mayor, who apologized. ""We just need to see that all officers are held accountable, and that there really is change moving forward within the culture of policing,"" Young said at a news conference. Atlanta and other cities have seen widespread protests over the past week after another video — that of George Floyd's arrest in Minneapolis — catalyzed outrage over violence in policing. Floyd died after Derek Chauvin — who has since been fired from the Minneapolis police and charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter — dug a knee into Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes. Video of the incident involving Pilgrim and Young caused a stir of its own. ""We understand our officers are working very long hours under an enormous amount of stress,"" the Atlanta mayor said Sunday, describing the video as ""disturbing on many levels."" ""But we also understand that the use of excessive force is never acceptable.""  Copyright 2020 NPR. To see more, visit https://www.npr.org. LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST: In dozens of cities yesterday, large, mostly peaceful demonstrations devolved into chaos. In Nashville, Miami, Seattle and Salt Lake City, Pittsburgh, Phoenix, New York and, frankly, too many other places to name, protesters expressed their rage at the death of George Floyd, police brutality and racism. There were violent confrontations with police, and police cracked down, also violently. There were also mass arrests and injuries among demonstrators, journalists and police. At least a dozen major cities declared curfews. Others called on the National Guard, which has been historically used in response to major civil unrest. There were scenes of National Guard marching through some residential neighborhoods, ordering people to stay inside. We go now to Los Angeles, where members of the National Guard were also deployed overnight and a curfew was put in place as a state of emergency was declared. NPR's Nathan Rott is in LA, and he joins us now. Nate, walk us through what happened yesterday. NATHAN ROTT, BYLINE: So there was a massive peaceful protest that started around noon yesterday. It was in the Fairfax district in west L.A., which is kind of a trendy neighborhood with high-end retail and a big outdoor mall. And people were protesting against police violence, as they are all over the country. They were memorializing George Floyd, the black man who died after being pinned to the ground by Minneapolis police officers. And, you know, by all accounts, it was peaceful, respectful until a little later in the afternoon, when we started seeing reports of police cars being set on fire and just a total breakdown in the situation. GARCIA-NAVARRO: This often happens at protests, right? When things shift as things go into the night. Do we know what happened? ROTT: Yeah. And that - honestly, that was a little surprising, Lulu. Usually, these, like, shifts do happen at night. And this started in broad daylight in mid-afternoon, which is, I think, very concerning to a lot of the city officials. So, you know, on social media, people were blaming the police for escalating tensions, for responding with tear gas and the sort of militarized riot gear that has become so commonplace around the country. City officials have so far blamed bad eggs in the crowd for setting things off, and that's something we've been hearing in a lot of places - that it's a small group of people who are agitating these situations. Of course, that's now been politicized, even with the U.S. attorney general blaming anarchists and leftists without, you know, providing any proof of that. But it's really hard to say what makes this situations shift. Tensions are obviously very high, so it doesn't take much to spark something. GARCIA-NAVARRO: No, it doesn't. We saw videos of looting and fires in many cities around the country last night. That was also the case in LA, right? ROTT: Yeah. A number of retail stores in that Fairfax area were broken into. Goods were stolen. Some were set on fire. I know firefighters were dealing with those fires throughout the night. That prompted LA's mayor, Eric Garcetti, to announce a citywide curfew, which caught a lot of people off guard because he announced it an hour before it went into effect. But here he is explaining why they did it and alluding to violent protests in 1992 following Rodney King. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ERIC GARCETTI: We've seen this before in Los Angeles. When the violence escalates, no one wins. And so everybody has to be responsible for owning this moment. Whether you wear a badge or whether you hold a sign, I'm asking all of Los Angeles to take a deep breath and to step back for a moment. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Does it seem like the curfew worked briefly? ROTT: Yeah, the crowds started to thin out even before the curfew started. I know in other parts of the state - Sacramento, San Diego - there were large confrontations between crowds and police. I think, you know, it's going to be interesting to see what happens over the next couple of days. GARCIA-NAVARRO: That's NPR's Nate Rott in LA. Thank you so much. ROTT: Yeah. Thank you, Lulu.

""Violence has no place and violence must be addressed,"" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told NPR's All Things Considered. ""But there is no reason for the U.S. military to be called out for this."" Pelosi was referring to a threat Trump made Monday evening in the Rose Garden at the White House. ""If a city or a state refuses to take the actions that are necessary to defend the life and property of their residents,"" Trump declared in a brief statement, ""then I will deploy the United States military and quickly solve the problem for them."" As the president spoke, federal officers in riot gear near the White House launched tear gas and pepper spray at peaceful protesters. Shortly thereafter, Trump strode through a park cleared of the demonstrators to pose with a Bible in front of St. John's Church, leading a group of officials that included Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. ""Walking like lapdogs behind a five-time draft dodging coward who is more interested in looking like a leader than actually being one,"" Sen. Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill., who lost both legs in combat as a military helicopter pilot in Iraq, said of Esper and Milley, ""sends a horrifying message to our troops — including our black and brown troops — that our military's leaders will not protect them from unlawful orders."" In a statement on Twitter, Duckworth added, ""We cannot allow any Commander in Chief to put our Armed Forces' reputation as the last institution Americans can trust and respect at risk by using them unlawfully and putting them in a position of exacerbating the divisions driving our union apart. ... Threatening military force and imprisonment against Americans exercising their Constitutional rights is not Presidential, it's tin-pot dictatorial."" But Trump does appear to have the power unilaterally to dispatch active-duty soldiers to trouble spots in the United States. The 1807 Insurrection Act authorizes a U.S. president to deploy military forces for domestic emergencies. The law was updated in 2006 to include natural disasters and terrorist attacks as grounds for sending federal troops to restore order. While condemning looting and vandalism that rocked Providence, R.I., on Monday evening, U.S. Sen. Jack Reed, a Rhode Island Democrat, called Trump's threats to use military force against American citizens ""irresponsible and destablizing."" ""The job of bringing calm will take law enforcement and the community working together,"" Reed, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, said in an emailed statement Tuesday. ""It will not come from recklessly invoking the Insurrection Act."" The Democratic chairman of the House Armed Services Committee told reporters Tuesday he plans to convene an in-person congressional hearing next week to press the Pentagon's top two officials on Trump's possible invocation of the Insurrection Act. ""We need to hear from Chairman Milley and Secretary Esper as to exactly how they intend to use the U.S. military trying to deal with this domestic crisis,"" U.S. Rep. Adam Smith, D-Wash., said on a video conference call. ""If the president is basically threatening to use the U.S. military to go in and enforce the law in U.S. cities, that runs the risk of an extreme escalation in violence and of a hugely disruptive practice."" Asked about Milley wearing camouflage fatigues in public Monday night, Smith said the nation's highest military officer may have misread the message being sent. ""The optics of him being in uniform out there might not have been so bad if we didn't have the president out there talking about going to war with the country and using the military and using overwhelming force,"" Smith said of Milley. In a conference call Monday, Trump told the nation's governors that Milley was ""a fighter, a war hero, a lot of victories and no losses and he hates to see the way it's being handled in the various states, and I just put him in charge."" Milley, whom Trump said was on the call, said nothing. But a senior Pentagon official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said later that the Insurrection Act had not been invoked by Trump and insisted that Milley's role and authorities have not changed.

However, the recent article about Vermont Packinghouse has me reconsidering my subscription (“Rising to meat demand,” May 24). Glorifying a slaughterhouse that has been under scrutiny for violations, and even had a petition against it, made me physically sick. The petition is still open and has more than 109,000 signatures. The place is a nightmare, and the article talked about animals as if they are just blades of grass to be mowed. Would it have been so hard to interview someone who could have added another point of view regarding the animals themselves? Let’s be clear and talk about facts. You do not need meat to live and be healthy. Meat production and raising livestock destroys the environment, even on cute little local farms. Humane meat and slaughter is a myth. Pigs like the ones that were pictured in the article being mutilated are actually smarter than the dog next to you on the couch. In the future, it would benefit newspapers covering articles involving the unnecessary taking of the lives of animals to investigate the business and any controversy surrounding it and get a variety of points of view. Let the readers know all sides, please. KRISTINA SNYDER Chester, N.H. The arts are more essential than ever I beg to differ strongly with Dick Tracy’s recent Forum letter claiming that the arts are not essential (“Piling huge debt on future generations,” May 28). If he has never gone to a concert or a show, read a book or enjoyed looking at sculptures or paintings in private or public places, then I suppose he has a point. The arts mean nothing to him. However, they mean a lot to others, especially in times like this, when we are confined to our homes. TV series and films are art. The actors, directors and producers are all part of an artistic community. So are the musicians and singers and authors who supply us with the songs we like to listen to and the books we like to read. I do understand the plight of our farmers, who are struggling terribly and need our support in any way we can give it. But why is there a belief that if one group gets some help it is necessarily taken away from another? In a reasonably just society, there would be enough for all. And is the law of supply and demand really “natural”? ULRIKE RAINER Hanover There’s a madness to Trump’s method Bob Scobie’s opinion column (“Why Trump insists on ‘going it alone,’ ” May 28) was a poignant and insightful political and strategic analysis of the subject. I was particularly struck with the first paragraph’s insight that President Donald Trump doesn’t actually ask his cult members for their “help,” but rather to trust him and follow him no matter what. While Scobie’s political analysis is helpful, it does tend to presume that there is intentionality in Trump’s actions — that is, a method in his madness. Taking a psychological perspective, I would contend that there is a madness in his method. Which is to say, the best way to understand anything Trump says or does is to remember that he is a megalomaniacal narcissist. Period. PHILIP ELLER Norwich Why are vape shops deemed essential? I am concerned that vaping businesses are considered essential during this pandemic crisis. These products have been deemed more dangerous than tobacco products. They are getting into the hands of our youth via adults and are being passed on. We have other businesses that are shut down and struggling to survive. I have contacted New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu’s office, left messages twice and sent emails twice, asking for a explanation on this subject. I feel this deserves a response from the governor. PENNY HULL Cornish Follow the example set by Dr. King For days, people have been destroying property, but President Donald Trump doesn’t know how to stop the destruction. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. set a good example of how to protest without destruction and burning property. King was a leader, but he didn’t teach to destroy property while protesting. Please, President Trump, tell the people to act like Dr. King. RUKIAH OERTLY Hartford Trump’s corruption and incompetence Yo, America. How’s the Donald Trump thing working out for ya? Let’s see. Start with the utterly botched COVID-19 response; the tens of millions of Americans abruptly unemployed; the deep tax cuts and other financial shenanigans for the uber-wealthy; and the mad, damn-the-torpedoes rush to “reopen” the economy, placing at risk the elderly, the vulnerable and those of us who don’t have the good fortune of getting paid to Zoom from home. And let’s not forget that, for days now, many of our nation’s cities have been blanketed by a thick carpet of smoke, tear gas and pepper spray. Could it be that the people have finally woken up to the Trump administration’s corruption and gross incompetence? Are the chickens coming home to roost? MARK LATHAM Hartford Those were the great old days ... Whenever I see a MAGA cap or banners with “Make America Great Again” emblazoned on them, my first reaction is to ask in what period of American history do President Donald Trump and his supporters find the special “greatness” that they wish to restore? Surely it can’t be the Roaring ’20s, with the evils of gangsterism and bootlegging spawned by Prohibition, nor can it be the Great Depression of the 1930s and the rise of Franklin Roosevelt’s quasi-socialist New Deal. And they can’t want to return to the years of World War II, when more than 400,000 Americans lost their lives. It must be the 1950s, the great Eisenhower years, the happy years of my own youth. It was the time of LP recordings and paperback books, revolutionary developments for students of the arts and literature. An impecunious undergraduate could actually put together a library of great books at little cost. Record players were available at moderate cost, and recordings of great classical music, while not entirely inexpensive, were nevertheless within reach. Great films, too. It was a great time for anyone interested in learning about and celebrating the arts. And the great smokes! I can still remember my first Lucky Strike, probably at 13; it’s a memory worthy of Marcel Proust’s madeleine. Medical doctors were featured frequently in the Saturday Evening Post and Collier’s. The ads for Camels included the great sales pitch, “Try their costlier tobaccos on your ‘T-Zone’ — T for throat; T for taste.” And, of course, they were right. They were doctors in white jackets. If they smoked Camels and found them soothing, why would I dare to disagree? Doctors are once again being recruited, not by Camel cigarettes this time but by Republican political operatives to “publicly support the president” and come together for the war on health care. Once again, I have a question: Will the president also want them to endorse his personal promotion of hydroxychloroquine? A final word, from an old smoker and a registered voter, caveat emptor.

It came on a violent night in St. Louis, where four officers were shot, officers were pelted with rocks and fireworks and 55 businesses were burglarized or damaged, including a convenience store that burned. Police also shot and gravely injured a burglary suspect who they say shot at officers.Cities across the U.S. have seen protests and violence since George Floyd died May 25 after a white Minneapolis officer pressed his knee into Floyd's neck for several minutes even after the handcuffed black man stopped moving and pleaded for air.Dorn, who was black, was a friend of the pawn shop’s owner and frequently checked on the business when alarms went off, his wife, St. Louis police Sgt. Ann Marie Dorn, told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.David Dorn served 38 years on the St. Louis police force before retiring in October 2007. He then became chief of Moline Acres, a small town in St. Louis County.Former St. Louis County police Chief Tim Fitch knew Dorn for 30 years and said they became close friends when Dorn and his wife were leading the St. Louis police department's Explorers program for young people interested in law enforcement careers, while Fitch was leading the county's program.“He was very dedicated to youth, especially disadvantaged youth,"" said Fitch, who led the St. Louis County Police Department from 2009 to 2014. “He wanted to see them succeed. He wanted to be a role model for those young men and women to go into law enforcement.”Dorn' s personality was “bigger than life,” Fitch said. ""He was a fun guy, a happy guy. You never had to wonder what he was thinking when somebody did something incredibly stupid like a crime because he would just say it as he saw it.”When he took over as chief in Moline Acres, Dorn made it clear that his officers would be held to the strictest of standards, Fitch said.“He wanted them to do the right thing all the time,"" Fitch said.The Ethical Society of Police, which represents black officers in St. Louis, said in a news release that Dorn was “the type of brother that would’ve given his life to save them if he had to.”St. Louis police Chief John Hayden called Dorn a ""fine captain.”“Many of us, the other officers, looked up to him,” Hayden said. ""Was very well-liked, very pleasant. And his wife still works here. So a very sad time for our agency. We will honor him.”",0.0

The two men are certain to face each other on the presidential ballot in November, yet party rules require them first to accumulate a majority of delegates in the months long state-by-state primary season.Trump secured the Republican presidential nomination in March.Pennsylvania, which offered Tuesday's largest trove of delegates, also represented a significant test case for Republicans and Democrats working to strengthen their operations in a premier general election battleground.Voters were forced to brave long lines in “militarized zones” because officials consolidated the vast majority of polling places in Philadelphia to minimize health risks, according to Erin Kramer, executive director of One Pennsylvania. She noted that some polling places in African American communities are in police stations.“Having to stand in line while police officers are entering and exiting the building on police business is not exactly how people want to spend their election day,” Kramer said.Biden was in Philadelphia earlier Tuesday to deliver remarks about the civil unrest that has erupted across the nation after the police killing of George Floyd. He didn’t talk about the primary, instead focusing his attention on Trump, whom Biden blasted as “more interested in power than in principle.”Related video: Joe Biden addresses civil unrest over police brutality of black men and womenVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is not actively campaigning for the Democratic presidential nomination, having suspended his operation and endorsed Biden, but his name appeared on the ballots. On the eve of Tuesday's primaries, senior adviser Jeff Weaver encouraged progressives to vote for Sanders anyway to help maximize his influence in the direction of the Democratic Party.The comments served as a reminder that Biden may have no legitimate Democratic rivals remaining, but he must still win over skeptical activists from his party’s far-left flank, who worry he’s too close to the political establishment.Party unity was an afterthought this week, however, as more immediate health and safety concerns dominated the national conversation. The coronavirus death toll has surged past 100,000 nationwide, and thousands of new cases are reported each day.At the same time, several major cities, particularly Washington, D.C., and Philadelphia among those voting Tuesday, struggled to contain protests and related looting that led to thousands of arrests.Some voters said Trump’s increasingly tough tone toward protesters inspired them to participate in the democratic process. Nicholas Autiello, who works in finance in Rhode Island, said he was disturbed by police driving back peaceful demonstrators near the White House on Monday.“Last night, we have a president who is acting like a dictator,” Autiello said. “So being able to come out here this morning and fill in a circle next to a name for someone who I know will restore honor and decency to the presidency was so important.”Political groups have had to adjust as some states move to a system that relies largely on voting by mail. They include Montana, where all 56 counties decided to vote entirely by mail, despite Trump's repeated warning against it. Voting rights watchdogs in multiple states on Tuesday expressed concerns about access to mail ballots, confusion about deadlines and a shortage of poll workers that led to long lines.Those voting Tuesday included the District of Columbia, Indiana, Maryland, Montana, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and South Dakota. Two other states holding primary elections on Tuesday, Idaho and Iowa, chose their presidential nominee early in the year.“We are in unique times, and voting is a unique challenge for people,” said Josh Schwerin, chief strategist for the pro-Democrat super PAC Priorities USA. He said that his organization and others would be watching closely on Tuesday “to see how well it works, where issues are and where obstacles have been put in place.”",0.0

Several hundred demonstrators gathered in the rain near the Commercial Street station while local and state officers and National Guardsmen stood by in riot gear. The tense standoff escalated at 8:30 p.m. when someone from the crowd threw lit fireworks and others threw water bottles at police. Police responded with tear gas canisters to disperse the group. A few minutes later, police moved its barriers further up, as protesters continued to lob fireworks and water bottles at police. Several protesters and officers could be seen reacting to being exposed to the tear gas.About an hour later, several lines of law enforcement moved forward, pushing the crowd back to the other side of the intersection of Commercial and Centre streets. Four people kneeled with hands up in front of the front line of officers. One man who kneeled in front of the frontline of police officers said he ""had to stand up for what he believes in,"" but didn’t want violence.“We come in peace,” said the man who only identified himself as a Brockton resident. “We don’t want war. We go home; they go home, and everyone is all peaceful. That is all we want.” Groups began gathering in front of West Middle School in Brockton for a peace rally at 5 p.m. Originally, the demonstration was going to be a march from the school to City Hall, but organizers decided to keep it on the school grounds to better contain it. During the peace rally, Brockton Mayor Robert Sullivan asked the crowd to take a knee and to shout George Floyd's name. But Sullivan also said there have been rumors about what might happen Tuesday night.“People might come to this community to try to create badness. It's not acceptable. That's not what coming together as a peaceful protest is about. So, we've taken precautions. Social media is not always accurate. We know that. We hope it's not,” Mayor Robert Sullivan said.Some businesses nearby boarded up their entrances, including a CVS near the Brockton fairgrounds. The commuter rail is not stopping at Brockton station because of the demonstrations, and riders are asked to use either Montello or Campello stations.",0.0

I have watched police attack and shoot my brothers on the reservation trying to protect their water supply.

I have watched a 90-year-old grandmother get in between the police with guns drawn and her 21-year-old grandson then to be shoved to the ground because her grandson had run a stop sign. I have watched while our president called torch-carrying Neo-Nazis “fine people.” I have watched false bravado “patriots” storm state houses because they feel oppressed by having to wear a mask and not go to the all-you-can-eat buffet. And finally I just watched sworn law enforcement officers murder a man in front of the nation while the man begged for his life, cried for his mother and finally urinated and defecated in his death throes. All the while as bystanders cried out for them to stop. I know this will upset some people, but so be it. If it bothers you more that a Target got looted and some wood and sheetrock has been burned, my suggestion is to watch the George Floyd video a few more times and try to understand where the people of color in our nation are coming from.

In his role as coach, Stevens has witnessed Brown go from a 19 year old drafted after one season playing in college to 20-point scorer in the NBA. Off the court, Stevens has seen Brown become a leader who is unafraid of using his voice to address important issues in society. So when Brown told his coach last Thursday that he was going to drive to Atlanta and help lead a Sunday protest over the killing of George Floyd, Stevens was hardly surprised. “Jaylen’s greatest impact, as good as he is at basketball, won’t be in basketball,’’ said Stevens during a Wednesday morning video conference with the media. “I just think he’s a special guy. He’s a special leader. He’s smart, but he has courage. He’s got a lot of great stuff to him. “I think we recognized that when we drafted him, but he has been even more unbelievable every day, every year. I’ve always personally really enjoyed listening to him and talking to him about things outside of basketball. He told me he was going down there on Thursday and I certainly am not surprised by him taking a leadership role. That’s who he is.’’ Brown was joined by Indiana Pacers guard Malcolm Brogdon at the rally in Atlanta, not far from Brown’s hometown of Marietta, Georgia. After driving 15 hours from Boston to Atlanta, Brown marched in a large crowd to protest the death of Floyd, who died having his neck pinned to the ground by the knee of Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin. While Brown was in Georgia, teammates Marcus Smart, Enes Kanter and Vincent Poirier were in Boston participating in a protest. “I don’t think it’s a great surprise that our guys are able to lead with such great courage,’’ said Stevens, “because they put themselves out there every day in kind of a meaningless game when you think about it. “I’ve said this many times. I think the NBA’s amazing and I think our players are amazing. We’re lucky that we have such great people representing us with the Celtics. I couldn’t be more proud to be in the NBA, to be with the Celtics and be surrounded by the people I get to go to work with every day.’’ The NBA is getting close to making plans to restart the season, perhaps in late July, and Celtics players started showing up at the Auerbach Center Monday for voluntary workouts. But Stevens said the focus is not on basketball with everything that is going on in the country, including the protests and the violence that has erupted after the death of Floyd. Stevens said that he wrote to his players over the weekend. “Extreme sadness,’’ said Stevens. “A lot of people feel the pain and it transfers to anger. I wrote a letter to our guys this weekend. It took me a while to put down exactly what I wanted to say. “I think the thing I wanted them to know is that every decent person is hurting. Every decent person feels the pain of the African-American community. But I also don’t want to pretend I know the exact distinct pain. What I wanted them to know is I’m with them.’’ There are 11 African-American players on the Celtics’ 15-man roster, and Stevens said that he knows the responsibility he has in these difficult times. “We were on a coaches call with all 30 coaches the other day,’’ said Stevens. “One thing I heard from a number of coaches was that as white coaches, we have a lot of responsibility here. “We may not be able to know the depth of the pain of our colleagues that are black, or our players that are black, our assistants that our black. But we have a responsibility to be not only empathetic but help drive change. “We have all been in these conversations before and you’re moved to drive change and sometimes actionable steps lead to what you think is progress but this sure doesn’t look like progress.’’ Stevens said that he sat in meetings with Celtics players four years ago when NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick was kneeling during the national anthem to protest social injustice. “From those three weeks of training camp, being able to sit in those meetings, being able to listen to our guys, I think that gave me a whole new understanding of just how much change is needed,’’ said Stevens. “At that time as an organization, we tried to make sure we were trying to do our part to create actionable steps. But there’s no question everybody’s got to do more. “The pain everybody feels has been there for a long, long time. The lack of progress is too jarring.’’",0.0

The event came amidst protests and unrest across the country in response to the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis on May 25. With a helicopter flying overhead and police cars parked nearby, attendees held up candles and shouted the names of people of color who have been killed by police or while in police custody. The Manchester Police Department estimated there were over 700 people in attendance, though that number could not be independently confirmed. After a series of chants and prayers, Black Lives Matter organizer Elijah Kendrick told white attendees they needed to work harder to become allies. “Use your privilege,” he told them. “If you see one of us get pulled over by police, stand right there. Use your privilege.” “Black lives matter,” he continued in call and response. “We don’t want to hear ‘all lives matter.’ We want to hear ‘black lives matter!’” Melvina Gaye, 19, said the event – organized largely by young people who grew up in Manchester – signaled a shift for the city. “This was actually one of the first events that I felt was actually lead by a bunch of black people,” she said. “To see that they're speaking out and we’re not going to keep silenced - it’s making others want to speak out too.” Jasmyn Dobe stood beside Gaye with a sign that read ‘If you’re not outraged you’re not paying attention.’ She and Gaye said they weren’t comforted by the number of city police and other members of law enforcement monitoring the city on Tuesday. “Where was this police presence when people were protesting the quarantine in front of the State House fully armed?” said Dobe, referring to recent rallies against the state's stay-at-home order. “To see the difference between the two is ridiculous.” The Manchester Police Department said it was keeping an eye on threats on social media of riots and violence. City police said in a press release on Wednesday that over the course of the night, ""other groups became unruly,"" setting off fireworks, attempting to block traffic, and confronting police officers who were in riot gear on South Willow Street. The police arrested 10 adults and 3 juveniles. Most were charged with Disorderly Conduct and Riot and all were released on PR bail. The press release confirmed that the vigil was peaceful, and there were no arrests. Black Lives Matter organizers said the protesters encountered elsewhere in Manchester were not affiliated with the group or the vigil.

Other cities should do likewise,” he posted.WASHINGTON — Demonstrators marched to the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday night, protesting the death of George Floyd in Minnesota and demanding that laws be changed to prevent more like it.Along their route from near the White House, there were troops in fatigues and officers from federal agencies keeping watch on the crowd. Barricades were put up around the Capitol, and the Capitol Police stood guard behind them.“We came here because they make laws here and we want the laws to change,” said Mohammed Wagdy, 26, of nearby Prince George’s County.As an 11 p.m. curfew in Washington neared, community activists urged the demonstrators to head home. Some did, but others said they were returning to the White House. Minneapolis — A full autopsy of George Floyd, the handcuffed black man who died after being restrained by Minneapolis police, was released Wednesday and provides several clinical details, including that Floyd had tested positive for COVID-19.The 20-page report released by the Hennepin County Medical Examiner’s Office came with the family’s permission and after the coroner’s office released summary findings Monday that Floyd had a heart attack while being restrained by officers, and classified his May 25 death as a homicide.The report by Chief Medical Examiner Andrew Baker spelled out clinical details, including that Floyd tested positive for COVID-19 on April 3 but appeared asymptomatic. The report also noted Floyd’s lungs appeared healthy but he had some narrowing of arteries in the heart.The county’s earlier summary report listed fentanyl intoxication and recent methamphetamine use under “other significant conditions” but not under “cause of death.” The full report’s footnotes noted that signs of fentanyl toxicity can include “severe respiratory depression” and seizures.--------------------All of the former Minneapolis Police officers charged in connection with the death of George Floyd are now in custody.

I have watched police attack and shoot my brothers on the reservation trying to protect their water supply. I have watched while three white men hunted down and executed a young black man for looking in a framed-in house. I have watched a 90-year-old grandmother get in between the police with guns drawn and her 21-year-old grandson then to be shoved to the ground because her grandson had run a stop sign. I have watched while our president called torch-carrying Neo-Nazis “fine people.” I have watched false bravado “patriots” storm state houses because they feel oppressed by having to wear a mask and not go to the all-you-can-eat buffet. And finally I just watched sworn law enforcement officers murder a man in front of the nation while the man begged for his life, cried for his mother and finally urinated and defecated in his death throes. All the while as bystanders cried out for them to stop. I know this will upset some people, but so be it. If it bothers you more that a Target got looted and some wood and sheetrock has been burned, my suggestion is to watch the George Floyd video a few more times and try to understand where the people of color in our nation are coming from. Our nation was built on violent protest. Maybe next time we should listen when someone takes a knee in silent peaceful protest, and not decry them as being unpatriotic. JIM SWAN Newport",0.0

Chris Pappas a clone of Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Tuesday, promising to bring a new generation of conservative leadership to the 1st Congressional District. >> Download the free WMUR appMower, a 30-year-old Bedford resident, signed his Declaration of Candidacy before dozens of supporters during a virtual Zoom event and then spoke with WMUR. He plans to file his paperwork for his candidacy Wednesday afternoon at the State House, becoming the first candidate to file for a major office in 2020.The filing period opens at 8 a.m. Wednesday and closes at 5 p.m. Friday, June 12. Mowers is expected to face former Dover City Councilor and former New Hampshire Republican Party Vice Chair Matt Mayberry in a GOP primary on Sept. 8. Mowers has a wide breadth of experience in politics in view of his age. He is a former aide to former New Jersey governor Chris Christie, a former executive director of the New Hampshire Republican Party, former New Hampshire director of Christie’s presidential campaign, former Trump campaign battleground states coordinator and former chief of staff to Dr. Deborah Birx in the State Department’s Office of the U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator.“I honestly believe Chris Pappas has let us down,” Mowers said. ""He said he was going to be different, he said he was going to be independent. He said he was going to work with the president to get things done, and he absolutely let us down on every single one of those metrics.” “I care deeply about making sure we have an advocate for New Hampshire’s small businesses, for New Hampshire’ middle class families, for New Hampshire’s veterans, someone who’s going to provide that independent conservative leadership that’s needed to deliver for them.”Even during the COVID-19 pandemic, Mowers said, “I think Chris Pappas has delivered a lot for Nancy Pelosi. I don’t’ think he’s delivered for the people of New Hampshire.”Update: Later Wednesday, New Hampshire Democratic Party Chair Raymond Buckley blasted Mowers as a “craven political opportunist” who is “using our state to buy a seat in Congress so he can fall in line behind Donald Trump and do his bidding at the expense of Granite Staters.“From repealing health care to promoting a total ban on abortion without exception to continuing to give Donald Trump his full support as he tear-gassed peaceful protesters for a photo op, Matt Mowers is not only wrong for the Granite State, he's dangerous.”Buckley's full statement can be read here.Mowers, meanwhile, said that when the Paycheck Protection Program ran out of money for a week, Pappas was on a “taxpayer-funded vacation” 4.4 million people filed for unemployment.Mowers said that while he is a strong supporter of Donald Trump, there are differences.“I think we need to put a lot more focus on reining in spending,” he said. “We’ve had Republican congresses, along with president, who have not always made that the focus, and we need to make that more of a focus. That’s an area where I want to go down there and really show some leadership on.”Mowers noted that his seriousness about working on behalf of constituents was shown by signing the U.S Term Limits Pledge to serve no more than three two-year terms if elected.While concerned about federal spending, Mowers praised Trump for his get-tough policy with China, not only on the COVID-19 crisis, but also on trade, forced technology transfers and theft of intellectual property, as well as other trade deals secured by Trump that Mowers said has helped American workers.He said that his experience at the State Department showed him how global issues can affect U.S. citizens.“We’ve had a lot of politicians talk over the years about the opioid crisis and the influx of illegal drugs,” he said. “In my first week at the State Department, I received a briefing that said the predominant amount of illegal drugs that came into northern New England came from Mexico, across the southern border and then up to Lawrence, Massachusetts, and spread out throughout the rest of northern New England.“That’s why I support building a wall,” Mowers said. “I know for a fact that it’s going to help stop the influx of illegal drugs. It’s also allowed me to understand that the influx of drugs also comes because of the illicit sale and shipment from China through the mail.”“I’ve worked on those issues and it helped me to understand that a focus on national security can really tie very close to home.”On the opioid crisis, Mowers said he has also conferred with local police and with treatment experts and recovering addicts.Mowers also said he has deep concern about racial unrest in the nation.“First and foremost, what we saw with George Floyd was sad and enraging,” he said. “To see anyone in a position of power like that to abuse it and commit a heinous crime is really infuriating. The folks who commit those crimes should be held accountable.“It shows that there continue to be issues in individual police departments around the country,” he said. “But we need to make sure people feel safe in their community in terms of race, and what we’ve seen is that rioters and those trying to incite violence are trying to disrupt that.”“I support the president’s efforts to do whatever it takes to ensure that we have peace in our communities,” Mowers said. “And I haven’t seen Pappas say one thing about violence and looting. I’m happy to have a real conversation about community policing, but we need to ensure that we’re speaking with a unified voice to condemn the violence we’re seeing, and we haven’t seen that from Pappas and a lot of the other folks there.” Speaking earlier to supporters, Mowers called his campaign “an amazing movement.” He said the COVID-19 pandemic and security concerns surrounding the riots in many cities “has highlighted to us the importance of this campaign. It’s highlighted over the past five months moreso why we need a new member of Congress to do down to Washington, D.C., somebody who’s going to represent New Hampshire, the ‘Live Free or Die’ state, and not just be one more vote for Nancy Pelosi.”“We’ve seen this Congress move further and further to the left and Chris Pappas has been part of it,” Mowers said. “They voted to give proxy voting recently. We all know that Chris Pappas has been a proxy vote for Nancy Pelosi from the moment he got to Congress. He’s voted with her 100 percent of the time.“He puts Nancy Pelosi’s interests ahead of the people of New Hampshire and it’s time for a change.”",0.0

But when the Canadian prime minister was asked what he thought of President Trump's actions to quash a wave of protests across the U.S., Trudeau paused before responding – for 21 seconds as the cameras recorded his awkward silence. During a Tuesday news conference in front of his Ottawa residence, the prime minister fielded this question from a reporter: ""You've been reluctant to comment about the words and actions of the U.S. president. But we do have now Donald Trump calling for military action against protesters. We saw protesters tear-gassed yesterday to make way for a presidential photo-op. I'd like to ask you what you think about that. And, if you don't want to comment, what message do you think you're sending?"" Before answering, the prime minister, sporting a beard and shaggy hair since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, glanced down at his lectern, opened his mouth as if to speak — then paused, shifted his weight and uttered a barely audible ""um"" as birds chirped in the background. ""We all watch in horror and consternation what's going on in the United States,"" he finally said. ""It is a time to pull people together, but it is a time to listen. ""It is a time to learn what injustices continue despite progress over years and decades. But it is a time for us as Canadians to recognize that we, too, have our challenges,"" he said. ""That black Canadians and racialized Canadians face discrimination as a lived reality every single day,"" Trudeau continued. ""There is systemic discrimination in Canada, which means our systems treat Canadians of color, Canadians who are racialized, as differently than they do others."" Trudeau typically displays reticence on Trump's actions, keeping in mind the centrality of the U.S.-Canada relationship and its huge cross-border economic interdependence. Canada in recent days has seen relatively small, peaceful protests in solidarity with U.S. demonstrations that first erupted last week in the wake of the death of George Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis. By contrast, the protests in U.S. cities have typically been much larger and have frequently devolved into clashes between police and activists. The Canadian protests supporting Black Lives Matter have sprung up in Montreal, Halifax, Toronto and Regina, the provincial capital of Saskatchewan. At the protest in Regina on Tuesday, when a few hundred people gathered, one of the organizers, Faith Olanipekun, told the CBC that, ""A lot of people here think that Canada isn't racist."" ""So it's important for us to come out, voice our concerns and let people know that we are suffering in Canada just as much as people in the U.S. are suffering,"" Olanipekun said. ",0.0
