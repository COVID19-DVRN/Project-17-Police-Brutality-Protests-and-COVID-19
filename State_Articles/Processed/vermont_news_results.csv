She has lived off grid in Danby for 30 years, and was named the 2016 Burlington Free Press Vermonter of the Year. Michael Moore’s documentary “Planet of the Humans” by Jeff Gibbs and Ozzie Zehner has stirred up a frenzy of criticism from climate change activists, a Rolling Stone rebuttal by 350.org founder Bill McKibben, and demands by filmmaker Josh Fox to take the movie down. I am motivated to write from the trenches of Vermont, where some of the film’s footage is centered, in response to the strident accusations that “Planet of the Humans” is causing tremendous damage to the climate change movement by casting renewables – wind, solar and biomass – in negative terms full of inaccuracies. Get all of VTDigger's daily news. You'll never miss a story with our daily headlines in your inbox. “Planet of the Humans” was too kind to renewable energy. It is an ugly business. Greed and political power combine with renewable energy to destroy the environment and the lives of the people who live nearby. After the video’s release, I received a critique originating from Vermont by someone I do not know stating, “My guess is that the group he is walking with in this section is Annette Smith’s Vermonters for a Clean Environment, which has done more harm to Vermont’s transition off of fossil fuels to renewable energy than everyone else combined.” Yes, that’s me, the thorn in the side of renewable developers. No, I was not in the film. In 1999, I founded an organization to fight a natural gas power plant and pipeline project supported by then-Gov. Howard Dean. Living off-grid with solar, batteries and a generator, I believed solar was our energy future. With facts, information and grassroots organizing, we ran the gas guys out of the state. In 2009, an industrial wind project was proposed in my county. Numerous people on both sides reached out asking us to get involved. To my surprise, wind energy development, especially on top of mountains, raised numerous issues. I had seen the 11 196-foot tall 600 kW wind turbines built in 1996 in southern Vermont and thought they were beautiful. I went with a friend whose farm hosted SolarFest to see a New York project with 50 420-foot tall 2.5 mW wind turbines. We talked to a farmer who hosted some of the turbines. We talked to neighbors who wished they hadn’t signed the lease because the noise was horrible after being told there would be no noise. On the ride home we agreed that what we saw was “very disturbing.” The next 10 years blur together as Vermonters elected a governor committed to building as much renewable energy everywhere possible. VTDigger is underwritten by: Gov. Peter Shumlin, Sen. Bernie Sanders, and Bill McKibben shut down conversations about impacts to communities and the natural environment because “we do not have time for that conversation.” At a Bernie Sanders press conference, we were compared to creationists. Shumlin called us “cave people.” Now, thanks to “Planet of the Humans,” we are finally having that conversation. The former state naturalist, a climate change scientist, a wildlife habitat specialist, and a former commissioner of fish and wildlife came together to educate the public about our mountains’ values for climate change adaptation, with a series of roundtable discussions called Peak Keepers about the importance of mountains for wildlife, water, and forests. When the Lowell Mountains were being sacrificed for the wind project developed by Green Mountain Power — subsidiary of Energir, 30% owned by fossil fuel pipeline developer Enbridge — Vermonters hiked up the other side of the mountain to see for themselves what “green energy” looks like. Don and Shirley Nelson’s farm bordered the wind project for a mile and a half. For 50 years, the Nelsons never kept anyone off their ~600 acres. They permitted people to hike up. GMP was not happy. With no notice to the Nelsons, GMP got a temporary restraining order and sued them, prohibiting everyone from going within 1,000 feet of the wind project site. Police with dogs patrolled and arrested people, including a reporter. At least 20 people were arrested on different occasions, some intentionally. A Vermonter invited Bill McKibben to come see for himself. He declined. After the wind project was built, the Nelsons got sick from the wind project’s acoustic emissions and had no choice but to sell to GMP. It came with a gag order so Don and Shirley cannot talk about their experience. They were collateral damage. Many other neighbors of industrial wind projects have shared the same fate. As more wind projects were proposed in Vermont, I watched people lose their innocence as they, like me, thought wind and solar energy were going to save the planet. The more we learned, the more opposed we became. The film neglects the societal damage caused by wind energy. Wind developers’ playbook requires dividing communities. It is guaranteed that opposition will arise, so they try to create a proponent group to combat the opponents. Even areas where wind projects have failed are left with animosities that will take generations to heal. We have seen companies offer to write letters for proponents to send to the local papers and try to buy votes. We have grieved the loss of people who have died deaths of despair after the mountains they loved were destroyed or their homes became uninhabitable after the wind projects became operational. In 2016, I felt the wrath of the wind and solar industry when someone filed a complaint with Vermont’s Attorney General alleging I was practicing law without a license by assisting people in participating in the regulatory process for energy projects at the Public Utility Commission. It was a criminal investigation. Newspaper editorials and Green Mountain Power came to my defense. I hired a criminal defense attorney who wrote a letter to the AG pointing out that “the AG’s office is not the surrogate of the politically frustrated.” The AG dropped it, and an attorney who previously sent a letter telling me he represented a wind and solar developer admitted he filed the complaint, but claimed he did it on his own. Industrial solar is no better. A wealthy developer seeking to cut more than 100 acres of forest filed lawsuits against a town, neighbors, state agencies, and even the governor while proclaiming he is saving the planet and anyone who stands in his way is “signing the death warrant of many Americans.” This year, biomass plant owner Engie came to the Vermont Legislature seeking subsidies to enable continuing burning forests for a small amount of electricity that drives up rates for Vermonters. The state’s leading environmental group Vermont Natural Resources Council, with Bill McKibben on their Advisory Committee, supported it. Bill McKibben did not weigh in. Apparently he prefers to maximize his own carbon footprint by traveling the planet lecturing people about how they have to reduce their carbon footprint. Try to talk to Bill McKibben about solar and wind energy. He treats it as a personal attack as though his feelings are hurt. He can endlessly rattle off statistics about climate change. But, when asked the question about who funds 350.org, he acted stupid, or as though it wasn’t relevant. VTDigger is underwritten by: I looked up 350.org’s 990s and learned that in 2017 the organization had $19 million in funding. Over a five-year period, the organization’s funding was $66 million. It is reasonable to expect Bill McKibben to know its source. Please do not feel sorry for Bill McKibben. He and his enablers doth protest too much. Yes, “Planet of the Humans” was too kind to the renewablists. It is all about the money. “Climate emergency” activists and their funders are doing a lot of damage to the planet by focusing only on CO 2, proclaiming wind and solar will save the planet, distracting us from the overarching issues of pollution, population and over-consumption that are killing our planet.

1617433601,2020-05-26 17:35:01,Vermont Law School Expecting 'A Healthy Number Of Students' This Fall,https://www.vpr.org/post/vermont-law-school-expecting-healthy-number-students-fall,en,False,"education and schools, colleges and universities",76749,digital.vpr.net,http://digital.vpr.net/#spider,"Colleges around the country are navigating the tricky process of choosing whether to re-open for in-person classes this fall. The University of Vermont, the state’s largest higher ed institution, is planning on bringing thousands of students back to school in a few months. But so are some of the state’s smaller colleges, like Vermont Law School in South Royalton. VPR's Henry Epp spoke with Vermont Law School President and Dean Thomas McHenry. Their interview is below and has been edited and condensed for clarity. Henry Epp: You’ve said you plan to re-open for in-person classes in the fall. What are you hearing from students on whether they will return to VLS? Are you expecting fewer students? Thomas McHenry: Well, we're very pleased to report that we have a healthy number of students coming in the fall. Hopefully, they will be healthy when they arrive. Our deposits are running about the same as last year and we enrolled 19 students in our accelerated JD program virtually last Thursday, almost half of whom have actually moved to South Royalton, even though their first semester of law school is being done virtually. So the appetite from the students to both be on campus and continue their law school study seems to be pretty strong. What measures are you putting in place to be able to have those students actually come back to campus in the fall? We've relied on some protocols developed in Connecticut and in the state of New York, and they involve things like testing and tracing — which would be done by the state — and social distancing. The simplistic version is: masks, gloves, temperature checks and distancing. But you can imagine that, you know, there are a host of considerations that we're taking into account because we're only going to do it if we can be sure that people are going to be safe. And so you haven't determined at this point if students will be required to quarantine once they arrive here? We expect that they will be required to quarantine for some period of time. But we're still working on the protocol to figure out exactly what we will require. We'd like to have similar protocols across the Vermont independent colleges, so we're all doing it the same way. And we'd also like to know that the governor and the commission that is working on economic recovery are supportive of the steps we're taking. Vermont Law School has had its share of financial struggles in the past few years. I'm curious what the financial impact of the coronavirus shutdown has been on your school. There's obviously been negative impacts in terms of costs, but there have also been costs that we haven't expended, such as travel. So we will actually be able to end this year in the black. And this will be the second consecutive year of a balanced budget at the school, which we're deeply proud of. Have you had to cut costs, though, in any area? We have not had to do any layoffs. We've only had two groups who were contracted with us. Our cleaning crews have actually stayed on and we're doing a deep cleaning of the school right now. Our cafe staff, they are on furlough at the moment, but we're hoping to welcome that them back in August with whatever the new protocols are going to be around providing food services. What about on the faculty side? I know there were some cuts to tenured faculty a few years back at Vermont Law School. Have you had to make any additional cuts there? Well, there were actually cuts to the faculty as a whole, not just to tenured faculty. And we did a restructuring, which has been financially very successful for the school. We're not anticipating that we will need to make any further cuts in faculty or staffing at this point. But frankly, it's just too early in the process to be certain. More from VPR: Car Protest Supports UVM Lecturers Facing Work Cuts You, right now, have several dual degree programs with UVM where students can earn degrees from both schools. You also opened a Burlington office earlier this year. Is a merger with UVM in the cards for Vermont Law School in the future? Not, I would say, certainly not in the near future. But we're looking for every opportunity to work closely with UVM on a variety of programs. We're talking to Nancy Mathews at the Rubenstein School about the possibility of jointly offering some courses together. We're thrilled about the 3+2 Program with UVM, and we're actually pursuing the possibility of having similar programs at Champlain and St. Michael's College. Are you committed to maintaining a physical independent campus in South Royalton going forward? Oh, I think certainly that would be the case in the near future and I expect over time as well. It's the heart of our activities and our programs. And one of the nice things about the virtual setting that we've learned so much about as a result of COVID, is it's made clear to us that from South Royalton we can offer our classes to people pretty much anywhere in the world.",0.0
1617524035,2020-05-26 22:00:06,"Forum, May 27: Hartford Selectboard wastes time, energy",https://www.vnews.com/Forum-May-27-34480572,en,False,,24712,vnews.com,http://www.vnews.com,"Hartford Selectboard wastes time, energy Hartford is about to lose its second town manager for health reasons. It appears Brannon Godfrey got sick of being micromanaged by the Selectboard and subjected to a squeeze play between federal laws and local policy. The so-called “Welcoming Hartford” ordinance is little more than an end run around federal immigration enforcement. It is a prime example of what happens when local officials try to second-guess state and federal policies, and is likely to blow up in the town’s face because of the board majority’s refusal to include a “savings clause.” As a member of the original Hartford Charter Commission, I championed the expansion of the Selectboard from five to seven seats to introduce diversity, which doesn’t seem to have resulted because, in Jim Kenyon’s words, “In recent years the Hartford Selectboard has taken on more of a leftist bent — for the betterment of the town.” (The latter is debatable, especially in light of Dennis Brown’s recent resignation in protest of potential open meeting law violations.) What is not debatable is that an inordinate amount of time and energy has been consumed trying to tie the hands of the town’s police chief and his highly professional force, who have already demonstrated a willingness not to harass undocumented immigrants, and this excursion into defying federal laws has been to the detriment of accomplishing necessary town business. Not only has there been a high-handed approach to informing the media, but it seems to apply to the citizenry also. Alicia Barrows commented that “not everybody has taken the time or had an opportunity to understand” the ordinance’s complexity, and the board “must make sure we are diligent in giving all the correct information.” Excuse me, but the time to clarify such a “complex” ordinance was before it was put before the voters for their consideration. As a Hartford taxpayer, I feel we are owed nothing less than that, especially if the town potentially stands to forfeit future federal grants in economically trying times. WILLIAM A. WITTIK Hartford Jenn Alford-Teaster for NH Senate District 8 I just had the pleasure of seeing Jenn Alford-Teaster present the science behind the COVID-19 pandemic on virtual “Science Cafe New Hampshire.” Alford-Teaster’s background in public health and her discernment about what keeps our communities safe is vital in times like this. It is essential to have leaders with knowledge of crisis management and who promote access to health care in rural communities. So here is some good news: She is running for New Hampshire Senate District 8. Alford-Teaster listens with respect and a “we’re in this together” attitude to the life stories of people in District 8; she is committed to improving lives. Especially when life gets challenging, she seeks out and finds plenty of sparks of hope, energy and love for the state. Knowing that there is a hardworking, smart, unifying and trustworthy leader to vote for in Senate District 8 gives me a spark of hope. Get to know Jenn Alford-Teaster and her solution-focused, everyone-on-board approach to improving the lives of New Hampshire’s citizens and communities. VIVIAN DOLKART Grantham Trump’s mind-boggling response to pandemic On May 20, a White House reporter, after reminding President Donald Trump of some of the brutal statistics surrounding the COVID-19 outbreak in our country, asked him, “What would you have done differently facing this crisis?” The president’s response was, “Well, nothing.” He then went on to describe “how amazingly well” we have done. Many U.S presidents have faced historically momentous and challenging events and have reflected on and learned from them. In addition to his tactics of blame and divisiveness in a time that desperately calls for national unity and healing, Trump stands alone in his monumental ignorance, arrogance and inability to engage in meaningful self-reflection. It boggles the mind. RON EBERHARDT Plainfield",0.0

The sprawling 10-day festival usually kicks off around this time of year but was canceled, like everything else, because of the coronavirus pandemic. But now the local jazz scene grapples with an even deeper loss, that of pianist and composer Peter Krag, who died from an apparent overdose last week after a long struggle with addiction. Krag, 34, was known locally as a go-to keyboardist for area jazz groups, such as the Ellen Powell Trio, Chris Peterman Quartet and Hot Box Honey, to name a few. He lived and breathed music, teaching by day and gigging by night. His earliest years were spent in California until his family settled in Vermont in the '90s. He showed incredible promise as a pianist in his youth, as noted by his longtime instructor (and eventual peer) Tom Cleary, who teaches jazz piano at the University of Vermont. Krag was Cleary's longest-running, most consistent student, having studied under the UVM instructor on and off since Krag was in sixth grade. ""He was one of the few students I asked to teach,"" recalled Cleary in a Zoom interview along with several of Krag's friends and collaborators. Cleary explained that after seeing the young Krag perform, he reached out to his parents to take him under his wing. ""He improved any musical situation he got involved in,"" Cleary continued. ""I can only be in awe of that."" Like most folks who roll in the local jazz scene, Krag sat in with many ensembles over the years. ""I was struck with how sensitive he was musically and how supportive he was [as a keyboardist],"" said guitarist John Creech, who played with Krag since the mid-2000s. ""There are musicians who kind of shine in support of [others]. That was the type of person Peter was. He didn't crave the limelight."" ""He was the glue,"" said drummer Geza Carr, another colleague. ""Other people we tried to work with, things would fall apart — the beat would get turned around, forms were lost. But with Peter, none of that stuff ever happened. He always made it work."" ""He was very precise,"" observed guitarist Max Bronstein-Paritz, who played with Krag in the Ellen Powell Trio. ""He knew exactly what he wanted to do."" ""He said a lot with his compositions,"" added Carr. ""I could feel what he was trying to express. What he was not able to express with words, he did with his writing."" Krag's friends all described him as warm, exceedingly kind, humble and selfless. Close friend and frequent bandmate Cynthia Braren (aka Thea Wren) said that even as Krag was dealing with his own inner darkness, he put it all aside to care for Powell, who died of cancer in November 2019. ""Ellen was pretty homebound toward the end of her life,"" Braren said. ""Peter went over to her house three or four times a week. He was a helper and companion. Through the deep connection they had fostered through music, he began to understand and appreciate what a true friendship is. ""We all felt he had turned a corner, but we were wrong,"" Braren continued, noting that she had kept in close contact with Krag while in separate quarantines over the last few months. ""I felt like he was coming out of his shell. He was as lucid and crisp and on it as I'd ever seen him."" Just this week, a new recording of Krag's surfaced online that came from studio sessions for Braren's 2019 debut album, In Between, recorded at Meadowlark Studios. At one point, Krag sat down at his instrument while the band was taking a break. Unbeknownst to him at the time, engineer David DeCristo was recording. The nearly 25-minute piece, available to stream on YouTube, flows with grace and elegance, yet it's not free of sonic conflict. ""Peter was very protective of his darker side and deeper emotions,"" said Braren. ""I wanted to crack the shell of this genius who had his struggles and so much to offer. I think there's a lot we didn't know."" For now, plans for an in-person memorial ceremony and celebration of Krag's life are on hold. But Braren says that an online tribute to his life, work and genius are in the works and could possibly happen during what would have been this year's Discover Jazz Festival in June. Follow Wren on Facebook and Instagram to find out more. We'll also have details on the Seven Days website as they become available, along with general updates on the festival's upcoming virtual offerings. Surfin' BTV click to enlarge File: Luke Awtry Bill Mullins of Barbacoa performing on Saturday in Burlington In case you missed it: Live music returned to the Queen City on Saturday, May 23. Burlington surf-rock band Barbacoa played what was undoubtedly the first in-person live show Vermont has seen since the pandemic shut everything down in mid-March. The group rocked out for approximately 30 minutes before Burlington police busted up the party. The band set up its gear in the vacant lot formerly occupied by Champlain Transmission. The nearby Junktiques Collective provided power via a considerable length of extension cords. A few folks, who likely saw a cryptic social media post foretelling the impending concert, gathered as Barbacoa started to play at about 4 p.m. Within minutes, the crowd grew, collecting cyclists, motorists and other passersby who were drawn in by the blaring guitars. The mass of onlookers peaked at about 40 heads — just before a BPD officer happened by. Let me tell you, it was Ned-Stark-is-about-to-be-beheaded quiet as the officer calmly approached the band. What could have been an ultra-tense, potentially riot-inducing moment resulted in a simple request to end the concert — for no other reason than the band was operating without a permit. Barbacoa acquiesced, though they did play one final banger as a send-off. What the concert proved is that, much like the dinos in Jurassic Park, life finds a way. I'm fully confident that, before summer's end, we will see a return to something resembling regular live music, albeit an appropriately socially distanced one. Barbacoa front person Bill Mullins said he hopes the band will play again soon. Even at an anarchic show like the one on Saturday, people self-governed and maintained appropriate distances. Sure, many folks didn't wear masks (don't get me started). But at least the risk of transmission is thought to be considerably less in open, outdoor spaces than in close quarters. The big question is: As Gov. Phil Scott continues to ""turn the spigot"" in regard to reopening, will he address outdoor public gatherings of a certain size? Additionally, will the Church Street Marketplace allow street performers to return? Stay tuned in the coming weeks as we hopefully get some clarity on these burning questions. Disclosure: Members of Barbacoa are Seven Days employees. Listening In If I were a superhero, my superpower would be the ability to get songs stuck in other people's heads.

Like any politician, humans aren't the only ones in the middle of an election cycle. One small town in Vermont appoints a mayor of the four legged variety. Meet Lincoln, a Nubian goat and the first pet mayor of Fair Haven, Vermont, elected to office in 2019. Her campaign caused quite the international stir. I got a phone call from Paris. They wanted to know what was going on. And then this year we made the A rumor times in 2019 the first round of the Pet Mayor race. Just because I think it was the first time this was happening. Word spread, especially in France. They were very interested to know what was happening. What's going on? Why's there go being the mayor? Liz Strep, a a reporter for New Station My NBC five covered the goat mayors rise to political fame and her 2020 bid for re election. But don't worry, Fairhaven isn't actually taking executive orders from a goat. The idea electing an animal mayor really started because the school needed a new playground, their playgrounds. I think 30 years old, it's just really not safe. This slide has a big hole in it, and it's just going down. So as a fund raiser, Teoh get a new playground. They thought of this idea. You know, why don't you let a pet mayor and that will spark donations? That's really their only platform, that these candidates are running forest to raise money. So these animals really aren't making any major decisions in the town. They're really more of a mascot to encourage people to donate money to those students. A new playground Last year's election was pretty small. There were, I believe, three candidates. Lincoln ended up winning. She was a young, spunky little goat, very friendly. So I think that really helped her win that election. Lincoln's first days Mayer was very official, though politicians on four legs do come with their challenges. Last year, Lincoln was attending her swearing in ceremony. She had a little bit of an accident. She lost some for marbles. I guess you could say over things a little bit of a commotion there, but it was very entertained. She made her mark. You could say that wasn't one of her final. She, I guess, had a pretty successful first term, which is why she was seeking re election this year. The pet election turned out to be a huge hit both in and out of Fairhaven. So when the 2020 cycle began, competition was fierce because last year was such a big success. And there was so much publicity about Lincoln becoming the town's first pet mayor. A lot of students in the Fairhaven grade school wanted to nominate their own pets, so we had a bunny, a hamster old horse. I think there were five or six dogs. Five acts. There were 18 candidates. There were three main candidates that stood out to voters. Lincoln, the incumbent goat, Sammy, the police canine. And Murphy, the therapy dog. Lincoln at a very successful first term as mayor being an incumbent. A lot of people knew her name already that she was definitely a front runner. She raised. I think, about 1000 or so dollars for the playground, but the goal is $80,000. They really need to raise a lot more money. Murphy thinks reading is important for kids. He thinks having a safe place to play and be outside and get off their phones. This has important. Murphy, a therapy dog, volunteers at the Bear Even grade school, so students were already very familiar with Murphy and Spur. These owner also had several fund raisers during his campaign, though he raised about $500 before the actual town meeting day vote for the school's playground. We were amazed that we were able to raise that much. And then there, Sammy, but police canine Sammy was actually a rescue dog. All the kids were very from there with her, and they're always I wanted her to come in and pay a visit. Do you get to vote today? Welcome to the election stuff Surveying the voters at the polls. A lot of them were very interested in what the name of the animal waas, but also how cute they were. Why do you want to be the war? Said She's so you want 4 to 9 semi because he's true. Why did you want pizzazz? He's cute, and she likes the log on leashes out polling place on town meeting day. A few of the candidates were outside kind of doing a meet and greet with the kids, though I think that could have swayed some of the undecided voters if they had a good experience. He's feeling great. You got to greet all the kids coming to vote. So it was his day. Well, I think she's hungry. That's about yet She's been nibbling on the building. It's a different sort of a day for Everybody Loves Dogs. And then there's even a greater population of love. Police K Nights, Theo Day after a town meeting day, I was in the classroom with a bunch of eighth graders who are counting ballots, and we were there as the results came in. I won't Lincoln doing because I wanted Lincoln personally because he leaves a lot of money for the playground. Last year, I will say this. Eighth grade class WAAS Chris Stan's Class Kristan is Lincoln's owner, so they were a little biased. They really, really were pretty for Lincoln to win. It's my pleasure to announce the winner of the mayoral race fair in Vermont this year. There are a winner is Murphy the dog with 146 votes. When it was announced over the speaker that Murphy had one, there was a little bit of the side. They were a little disappointed, but it didn't take long for them to start cheering and applauding for Murphy. They were very excited that passing the torch on and it's a new year. I think they're looking forward to seeing what Murphy will do with his mayoral seat. I think Murphy will do a great job with the playground fun, so I really wanted him from that store sampling to win. Yeah, I asked him. He didn't care, but he's a new playground and an excuse to see adorable animals weren't the only benefits to the 2020 pet election. The kids were able to learn valuable lessons about exercising their voting rights. Your vote is your voice in the Democratic process. You have a lifetime of voting ahead of you, and I have to take that chance. Every opportunity you get. At the end of the day, this whole pet mayor raises to raise money for the playground, but also to really introduce kids to the importance of voting and taking election seriously, getting to the voting booth and making your voice heard. That's a right that we all have. You know, where U. S citizens and starting that process really early and getting Kate's excited about this process. That's really built goal of all of this. It doesn't matter who wins the playground, the kids, that's what it's about. They haven't reached their goal yet for the playground, but they're really helping that. Murphy can pulls through and get a lot of donations during his time as mayor. And, of course, we had to know. Will this small Vermont town ever hand over the mayoral office to a human? I don't think that there haven will have a human mayor anytime soon. Because Fairhaven has a human town manager, which is essentially sort of the same thing as a mayor. He makes a lot of the big decisions. He oversees that select board. So I think the town government is free, comfortable with just having a town manager. But I think they also really love having a pet mayor. If you'd like to donate to the Fairhaven Grade School Playground Fund, check out the link to the go Fund me in the description box.

(Facebook/Darnella Frazier/CNN) On Minneapolis' south side, officers fired tear gas and rubber bullets to drive back crowds of protesters who then set cars and businesses on fire and broke into stores, including some near a police station. Shortly before midnight, scores of officers on foot and in vehicles moved in to curb the violence a day after city and state leaders faced blowback for their handling of the crisis. Protesters on Thursday torched a police station soon after it was abandoned by police and vandalized dozens of businesses. The Pentagon took the rare step Friday of ordering the Army to put several active-duty U.S. military police units on the ready to deploy to Minneapolis, according to three people with direct knowledge of the orders who did not want their names used because they were not authorized to discuss the preparations. Ben Hubert, 26, of Minneapolis, said he wasn't surprised people were breaking curfew and setting fires. ""I'm outraged,"" he said of the Floyd case. ""But I'm also sad. The injustice has been going on for so long. It's been swelling for years."" Downtown, thousands of protesters encircled a police station after the 8 p.m. curfew. ""Prosecute the police!"" some chanted, and ""Say his name: George Floyd!"" There was no violence, though some protesters sprayed graffiti on buildings. The renewed protests came after Officer Derek Chauvin, 44, was charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. He also was accused of ignoring another officer who expressed concerns about Floyd as he lay handcuffed on the ground, pleading that he could not breathe while Chauvin pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes. Floyd, who was black, had been arrested on suspicion of using a counterfeit bill at a store. Chauvin, who was fired along with three other officers who were at the scene, faces more than 12 years in prison if convicted of murder. An attorney for Floyd's family welcomed the arrest but said he expected a more serious murder charge and wants the other officers arrested, too. Prosecutor Mike Freeman said more charges were possible, but authorities ""felt it appropriate to focus on the most dangerous perpetrator."" As the night dragged on, more fires erupted on the south side: A Japanese restaurant, a Wells Fargo bank, another restaurant, an Office Depot. Many burned for hours. Mayor Jacob Frey tweeted that firefighters could not respond until areas were secure. He said the city was working with the National Guard and the state to ""provide support in the south."" Protests nationwide have been fueled by outrage over Floyd's death and years of police violence against African Americans. Protesters smashed windows at CNN headquarters in Atlanta, set a police car on fire and struck officers with bottles. Large demonstrations in New York, Houston, Washington, D.C., and dozens of other cities ranged from people peacefully blocking roads to repeated clashes with police. ""You are disgracing our city,"" Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms told protesters. ""You are disgracing the life of George Floyd and every other person who has been killed in this country."" Police were trying to put Floyd in a squad car Monday when he stiffened and fell to the ground, saying he was claustrophobic, a criminal complaint said. Chauvin and Officer Tou Thoa arrived and tried several times to get the struggling Floyd into the car. Chauvin eventually pulled Floyd out of the car, and the handcuffed Floyd went to the ground face down. Officer J.K. Kueng held Floyd's back and Officer Thomas Lane held his legs while Chauvin put his knee on Floyd's head and neck area, the complaint said. When Lane asked if Floyd should be rolled onto his side, Chauvin said, ""No, staying put is where we got him."" Lane said he was ""worried about excited delirium or whatever."" An autopsy said the combined effects of being restrained, potential intoxicants in Floyd's system and his underlying health issues, including heart disease, likely contributed to his death. It revealed nothing to support strangulation as the cause of death. There were no other details about intoxicants, and toxicology results can take weeks. In the 911 call that drew police, the caller describes the man suspected of paying with counterfeit money as ""awfully drunk and he's not in control of himself."" After Floyd apparently stopped breathing, Lane again said he wanted to roll Floyd onto his side. Kueng checked for a pulse and said he could not find one, according to the complaint. Chauvin had his knee on Floyd's neck for 8 minutes, 46 seconds, including nearly three minutes after Floyd stopped moving and talking, the complaint said. Chauvin's attorney had no comment when reached by The Associated Press. The prosecutor highlighted the ""extraordinary speed"" in charging the case four days after Floyd's death and defended himself against questions about why it did not happen sooner. Freeman said his office needed time to gather evidence, including what he called the ""horrible"" video recorded by a bystander. News of the arrest came moments after Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz acknowledged the ""abject failure"" in responding to this week's protests and called for swift justice for the officers. Walz said the state took the lead after the police station burned. ""Minneapolis and St. Paul are on fire. The fire is still smoldering in our streets. The ashes are symbolic of decades and generations of pain, of anguish unheard,"" Walz said. President Donald Trump said Friday that he'd spoken to Floyd's family and ""expressed my sorrow."" He called video of the arrest ""just a horrible thing to witness and to watch. It certainly looked like there was no excuse for it."" Attorney Benjamin Crump, who is representing Floyd's family, asked to take custody of Floyd's body for an independent autopsy. The doctor who will do the autopsy is Michael Baden, former chief medical examiner of New York City, who was hired to do an autopsy for Eric Garner, a black man who died in 2014 after New York police placed him in a chokehold and he pleaded that he could not breathe. State and federal authorities also are investigating Floyd's death. ___ Associated Press writers Steve Karnowski, Aaron Morrison and Doug Glass in Minneapolis, Gretchen Ehlke in Milwaukee, Bernard Condon in New York, and James LaPorta in Delray Beach, Fla., contributed to this report.

Scott says it's too soon to ease out-of-state travel restrictions Governor Phil Scott is resisting mounting pressure from Vermont’s tourism industry to ease restrictions on out-of-state visitors. Scott said he understands his 14-day quarantine order for people entering the state has hurt the summer tourism season. “I mean we know this is somewhat the lifeblood of Vermont and we want to do this as quick as we possibly can. But we have to do it safely. We can’t lose ground on all the ground we’ve gained,” Scott said. The lodging industry say Scott's travel restrictions could decimate summer business this year. But Scott said more than 40% of all COVID-19 cases in the United States are within a five-hour drive from Vermont. And he said easing travel restrictions too quickly could lead to a resurgence of the virus locally. - Peter Hirschfeld Read the full story, here.

Burlington anticipates the return of hundreds of out-of-state college students Monday Hundreds of out-of-state college students are expected to move back to Burlington Monday to live in off-campus housing - and that's raising concerns about a possible spike in COVID-19 cases. State guidelines require out-of-state visitors to quarantine for up to two weeks. Mayor Miro Weinberger said the University of Vermont and Champlain College are both working with the city and state health department to address the situation. Weinberger said the National Guard will also set up a testing site at the Waterman Parking lot beginning June 3. ""This site will run throughout the month and the Guard will be putting out additional information and details,"" Weinberger said. ""But that will be right there in that central part of UVM's campus, which will make it accessible to Champlain College students who want to walk there and get tested as well."" Weinberger said if students test positive, they will need to isolate at home or at a state-run isolation facility. Weinberger also said Burlington Police will be conducting additional patrols in neighborhoods with lots of students to make sure public health directives are being followed. ""These patrols happen in the spring and the fall and [we] have been doing [them] for the last eight years,"" he said. ""They've been very successful in bringing down noise complaints in the city. They now have this additional charge, these patrols, of looking for gatherings in violation of the governor's stay-at-home order.""

""To be clear, this pertains to social gatherings like cookouts, or outdoor get-togethers. It does not change the 25% capacity limit set for things like retail or lodging,"" Scott said. The previous limit on public gatherings was 10 people. Scott said a sustained decline in new COVID-19 cases means people can now safely gather in larger numbers. - Peter Hirschfeld Read the full story, here. VA Health Center to host virtual Decoration Day celebration The VA Health Center in White River Junction will honor veterans with speakers, a wreath and Taps on Saturday. The event will be traditional, in that May 30 is the date when Decoration Day, now known as Memorial Day, was first observed. But it will also break with tradition. Due to COVID-19 restrictions, it will be a virtual event, staged on Facebook. Brett Rusch, the VA's executive director, said, ""We just simply felt that it was too early with too much uncertainty at this time to move forward with what has always been a very large public event."" By moving their observation online, the VA hopes to enable more veterans and their families to participate. - Betty Smith New report indicates black and hispanic Vermonters were more likely to contract COVID-19 than white Vermonters The percentage of black Vermonters who have gotten COVID-19 is two times the percentage of white Vermonters who have contracted the disease. That's one takeaway from a weekly data summary released Friday by the Department of Health. The report also notes hispanic Vermonters are also more likely to have gotten COVID-19 than their non-hispanic counterparts. The disparities are not unique to Vermont. National research has shown black Americans are both more likely to get the disease and more likely to die from it. Studies cite racism and economy disadvantages as common causes of health disparities. - Emily Corwin Activists, community groups to gather with masks, social distancing to protest the killing of George Floyd Activists and community groups will gather in Burlington Saturday to protest the killing of a black man in Minneapolis. George Floyd died after a white police officer arresting him kneeled on his neck for several minutes. Video footage of the incident has sparked outrage across the country. Harmony Edosomwan, one of the organizers of the Burlington protest, said the event is meant to honor George Floyd and other black people who have died during interactions with police. ""The objective is just to bring the Burlington community together and acknowledge that white supremacy does exist here in Burlington,"" Edosomwan said. Edosomwan said they also want Burlington Police to commit to working with more black and brown organizations in the city. ""Make a commitment to working with the leaders and organizers, the black and brown leaders and organizers right here in Burlington, to ensure our safety,"" Edosomwan said. ""I want them to be committed to that."" Burlington Police Chief Jennifer Morrison said she is horrified by the actions that led to George Floyd's death. ""It's a perversion of everything that American police are meant to do. It is the antithesis of protecting and serving and it goes against every piece of training I've had or overseen during my 30 years on the job."" The protest will take place Saturday at 6 p.m. at Battery Park. Edosomwan said attendees should wear cloth masks and practice social distancing. - Liam Elder-Connors Southwestern Vermont Medical Center to set up virtual waiting room Southwestern Vermont Medical Center in Bennington is setting up a virtual waiting room to free up space inside the hospital. Gail Balch is director of information technology, and said the recent move to offer some elective procedures has made it a challenge to maintain social distancing in the waiting room. ""We can't have everybody herded in to a single waiting area, and this will help decompress that volume,"" Balch said. Patients with a cell phone can wait inside their car in the parking lot and get a text message when their provider is ready. - Howard Weiss-Tisman Vermont RV dealers report a spike in business National reports show a spike in demand for Recreational Vehicles, thanks to COVID-19. And Vermont dealers say the trend is playing out here too. Pete's RV Center is a dealership with five locations, including one in South Burlington. According to Marketing Director Phil LecClair, sales are up at least 50% over this time last year. Many customers are first-time-buyers with pandemic concerns. ""A lot of frontline people, people with the elderly living with them,"" LeClair said. ""And then, you know, financially, because people are unemployed, not knowing if they're going to be able to continue in the house or apartment they're in now, they've reached out... looking for cost effective temporary housing."" RVs are also benefitting from concerns about air travel, and closures of lodging establishments. - Betty Smith More from VPR: What Will Tourism Look Like In Vermont This Summer? Attorney General's office withdraws action against Rutland gym The Vermont Attorney General's office has withdrawn it's request for a preliminary injunction against a Rutland gym and it's owner, who opened despite an executive order barring fitness centers from operating due to COVID-19.

By moving their observation online, the VA hopes to enable more veterans and their families to participate. - Betty Smith New report indicates black and hispanic Vermonters were more likely to contract COVID-19 than white Vermonters The percentage of black Vermonters who have gotten COVID-19 is two times the percentage of white Vermonters who have contracted the disease. That's one takeaway from a weekly data summary released Friday by the Department of Health. The report also notes hispanic Vermonters are also more likely to have gotten COVID-19 than their non-hispanic counterparts. The disparities are not unique to Vermont. National research has shown black Americans are both more likely to get the disease and more likely to die from it. Studies cite racism and economy disadvantages as common causes of health disparities. - Emily Corwin Activists, community groups to gather with masks, social distancing to protest the killing of George Floyd Activists and community groups will gather in Burlington Saturday to protest the killing of a black man in Minneapolis. George Floyd died after a white police officer arresting him kneeled on his neck for several minutes. Video footage of the incident has sparked outrage across the country. Harmony Edosomwan, one of the organizers of the Burlington protest, said the event is meant to honor George Floyd and other black people who have died during interactions with police. ""The objective is just to bring the Burlington community together and acknowledge that white supremacy does exist here in Burlington,"" Edosomwan said. Edosomwan said they also want Burlington Police to commit to working with more black and brown organizations in the city. ""Make a commitment to working with the leaders and organizers, the black and brown leaders and organizers right here in Burlington, to ensure our safety,"" Edosomwan said. ""I want them to be committed to that."" Burlington Police Chief Jennifer Morrison said she is horrified by the actions that led to George Floyd's death. ""It's a perversion of everything that American police are meant to do. It is the antithesis of protecting and serving and it goes against every piece of training I've had or overseen during my 30 years on the job."" The protest will take place Saturday at 6 p.m. at Battery Park. Edosomwan said attendees should wear cloth masks and practice social distancing. - Liam Elder-Connors Southwestern Vermont Medical Center to set up virtual waiting room Southwestern Vermont Medical Center in Bennington is setting up a virtual waiting room to free up space inside the hospital. Gail Balch is director of information technology, and said the recent move to offer some elective procedures has made it a challenge to maintain social distancing in the waiting room. ""We can't have everybody herded in to a single waiting area, and this will help decompress that volume,"" Balch said. Patients with a cell phone can wait inside their car in the parking lot and get a text message when their provider is ready. - Howard Weiss-Tisman Vermont RV dealers report a spike in business National reports show a spike in demand for Recreational Vehicles, thanks to COVID-19. And Vermont dealers say the trend is playing out here too. Pete's RV Center is a dealership with five locations, including one in South Burlington. According to Marketing Director Phil LecClair, sales are up at least 50% over this time last year. Many customers are first-time-buyers with pandemic concerns. ""A lot of frontline people, people with the elderly living with them,"" LeClair said. ""And then, you know, financially, because people are unemployed, not knowing if they're going to be able to continue in the house or apartment they're in now, they've reached out... looking for cost effective temporary housing."" RVs are also benefitting from concerns about air travel, and closures of lodging establishments. - Betty Smith More from VPR: What Will Tourism Look Like In Vermont This Summer? Attorney General's office withdraws action against Rutland gym The Vermont Attorney General's office has withdrawn it's request for a preliminary injunction against a Rutland gym and it's owner, who opened despite an executive order barring fitness centers from operating due to COVID-19. In a press release Thursday, the Attorney General's office said they were withdrawing the motion, in anticipation of Gov.

Hundreds of protesters gathered in Battery Park in on Saturday evening, calling for change. They say they’re tired of continually hearing of police brutality, and the killings of black men and women. “I haven’t been able to sleep well all week, my heart aches for George Floyd. My brothers name is George, what if that was my brother. He was my brother,” says Harmony Edosomwan, lead organizer of the protest. The protesters marched to the nearby Burlington Police Headquarters, calling for criminal justice reform. “Bring corrupt Police to justice, if we could bring a boy back his life, and a mother back her son, a father back his boy, return bullets to a gun. Unloosen the lynch rope and unravel the massive choke throats, we would not be choking on tears. When do our lives become valuable,” said one speaker. Protesters like Fern Thompson, understand that racism has existed in our country for far too long. “I’m here to protest every single black person that has been killed at the hands of white supremacists, cops, one and the same. It’s been going on for as long as we’ve been a country and it shouldn’t be going on any more and it just needs to stop.” Vergennes Police Chief George Merkel, is President of the Vermont Association of Chiefs of Police. He wrote Saturday night that he’s sad and outraged — adding, there was no reason for Floyd to have died. Vermont State Police have also been vocal, condemning the actions of the four Minneapolis Police Officers involved, as ‘beyond disturbing’, saying they have no place in law enforcement.",0.0

Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDigger This story was updated at 11:28 p.m. Vermonters rallied in Burlington and Montpelier Saturday as protests against police brutality erupted across the country in the wake of the death of George Floyd at the hands of police in Minneapolis. In Burlington, signs and speeches escalated to a verbal confrontation with city police officials as demonstrators marched on the Burlington Police Department. Demonstrators in Montpelier lined the city’s downtown, chanting and waving signs calling for racial justice. Get all of VTDigger's daily news. You'll never miss a story with our daily headlines in your inbox. In cities around the country, people took to the streets after Floyd, a 46-year-old black man, died Monday when a white police officer kneeled on his neck for more than 8 minutes. Floyd’s death, recorded on video, ignited widespread backlash against racial disparities in police violence. In sharp contrast to the quiet streets that have characterized the coronavirus crisis since the country shut down in March to prevent the spread of the illness, demonstrations have grown through the week. Protests have become violent in some places, and authorities in nearly a dozen American cities implemented curfews on Saturday as they braced for more. In Vermont on Saturday, where the governor has ordered gatherings to be capped at 25 people because of Covid-19, people came together wearing masks and carrying signs. Police estimated between 1,200 and 1,500 people gathered in Burlington, where protesters first met in Battery Park before marching on the city’s police department. The protest came to a peak when lead organizer Harmony Edosomwan, bullhorn in hand, stood above Burlington Police Chief Jen Morrison on a blue pickup truck in the parking lot of the BPD station. “Their blood is on your hands, if you don’t do anything to fix this motherf—— department!” Edosomwan shouted into the bull horn, as she poured a bright red liquid substance, symbolizing the blood of people of color who have died in altercations with police, from a jug at the feet of Morrison, Deputy Police Chief Jon Murad and Vermont State Police Captain Garry Scott. Lead organizer Harmony Edosomwan demanded BPD chief Jen Morrison meet her in the police station parking lot. Edosomwan confronts her and other officers, pouring a red liquid in front of them and threatens that if another POC dies, “that building is going motherfucking down.” pic.twitter.com/2jO9MTea0G — Grace Elletson (@graceelletson) May 31, 2020 VTDigger is underwritten by: Edosomwan asked the police chief to account for the department’s record of disproportionately using force against people of color and past incidents where Burlington police were accused of brutality against black people. “If another motherf—— black person, brown person — or even a motherf—— white person — dies on one of y’all’s n—- hands, that building is going motherf—— down,” Edosomwan said. “Do you understand that?” “I’m going to give y’all grace today, because I believe in people sometimes,” Edosomwan said. “I’m angry as f—. We could easily turn this shit up right now.” “If you turn this into Minneapolis,” Morrison responded, referencing the center of the unrest, “guess what, it’s going to set us back five more years.” Earlier in the evening, attendees had attempted to follow guidelines to prevent the spread of Covid-19 by keeping some distance between people. But the crowd pressed in as people strained to hear the conversation between Edosomwan and Morrison. Nearby, one protester got into a shouting match with a man trying to keep people from sitting and standing on a BPD police car. That same man — who was wearing a vest that said security on it, but Morrison confirmed does not work for BPD — also began shouting with protesters who had removed the American and Vermont State Police flag from the station’s flagpole and replaced it with the Black Lives Matter flag. Vermont and Burlington law enforcement officials had condemned the conduct of Minneapolis police officers against Floyd in statements earlier this week. On Friday, the Vermont State Police announced that it would review its use of force policies and trainings in the wake of Floyd’s death. State Police Col. Matthew Birmingham called the police behavior on the video “beyond disturbing.” In an interview after the protest, Morrison said that she did not take Edosomwan’s message as a threat, and she met with protesters outside to listen to their frustrations. “I took it as an expression of the need for us to continue to listen and to work with communities of color,” Morrison. “I think these folks have very legitimate grievances.” She said the station did see some damage during the protest — it had been spray painted and one window was broken. Earlier in the evening, before protesters marched to the police station, speakers had shared their anguish over the death of George Floyd in Battery Park to a crowd of attendees, almost all of whom were wearing masks. It began with a moment of silence for Floyd and others who have died from police violence. “Why must I walk around, each and every day, with black trauma on my back? Why must my days be filled with guilt, grief and walking cautiously?” Edosomwan said, speaking to the crowd. “I’m jealous. I’m jealous there are folks walking the same earth as me and they don’t have a target on their backs.” People carried signs that read “Black Lives Matter” and “white silence is violence.” A caravan of cars continually passed by the park, honking and chanting in support, amid a pandemic when not all were willing to take the risk to attend in person. VTDigger is underwritten by: In an interview before the demonstration began, Edosomwan said she felt a “calling” within herself to organize the event. “I can’t sit still when an injustice takes place,” she said. Demonstrators also gathered in other towns to rally against police brutality and racial injustice. Events were planned in Middlebury and Hanover, New Hampshire. In Montpelier, protesters began gathering around 4:30 p.m. at the intersection of State and Main Streets. Over the next hour, more than 100 people lined the four corners, holding “Black Lives Matter” signs and “Justice for George Floyd” flyers. Sylvie Dewes, an 8th grader at Main Street Middle School, said she and her friends had posted the flyers around town on Friday — then reposted them on Saturday after several were torn down. Dewes, 13, is from St. Louis, Missouri, near where Michael Brown was shot and killed by a police officer in 2014, sparking a national wave of protests. “I was in 2nd grade during the Ferguson riots in 2014, and so it’s personally really important to me,” Dewes said. “I wanted to inspire others.” Nathan DeGroot, a local activist, said it was important to show solidarity with the protests happening nationwide. “It’s important to show that we care about people of color in this country, and specifically the black lives that are being lost right now,” they said. Holding a sign that read, “All cops are complicit,” DeGroot pointed out that 17 Vermonters have died at the hands of police since 2010, and several of those people had mental health issues. “By participating in a police system, you are complicit in the things that happen,” they said. As protesters crossed the intersection during each cycle of the stoplight, Lindsey Sterrett led the crowd in chants of “No justice, no peace!” “I’m just mad,” Sterrett said. “I think a lot of people are mad and frustrated, and it feels good to all be here together.” Sterrett is also an early childhood educator. “I’m most concerned for the children of today and the world they will inherit, and the culture we’re perpetuating,” she said. “We have white privilege. We need to put our bodies on the line, just like other people have done in centuries past. If we don’t do that, nothing is going to change.” Correction: This article has been updated to correct the pronoun used in reference to Nathan DeGroot. VTDigger regrets the error.

In Burlington, where there were no reports of any arrests, 1,200 people packed Battery Park to let their voices be heard, and not just for George Floyd. The group marched toward and surrounded the Burlington Police Department. Protesters confronted Interim Chief Jennifer Morrison and Deputy Chief Jon Murad about past incidents of police violence in the Queen City. The group called for the firing of officers Joseph Corrow and Jason Bellavance, subjects of two excessive force lawsuits two years ago. The same for officer Cory Campbell, who faced no criminal charges after he got into a fight with a man who died three days later. ""I understand that [protesters] are upset. This is not news to me that they are aggrieved by incidents that happened prior to my tenure here as chief of police and I want to hear their voices. I want to hear their concerns. I’m not eager to rehash personnel issues that have already been resolved,” Morrison said. Chief Morrison says she’s willing to sit down with protesters and hear their concerns, but protest leader, Harmony Edosomwan, says she’s not interested. “Literally, all she has to do is fire them. We don’t need to talk about that,” Edosomwan said. “They did an injustice. The community has said multiple times that they don’t want them on the force. If that’s the case, then get them off the force. The community is speaking.” Protesters accused Burlington Police of failing to protect the black community. Morrison says the protest indicates to her the department has work to do. ""I’m not in a position to say they don’t believe that. If they believe that, we need to know that and we need to continue to work collaboratively until we get to a point where everybody feels they are being afforded the same level of protection,” she said. Protesters and police both recognized and appreciated that the event remained peaceful. There was another organized protest in Vermont Sunday afternoon in Brattleboro. ",0.0

Officer Derek Chauvin, a white police officer with over a dozen complaints for brutality during the course of his career, kneeled on Floyd’s neck for 8 minutes and 46 seconds — even though Floyd was lying face down on the ground and hand-cuffed from behind. Officer Thomas K. Lane held Floyd’s legs down and Officer J. Alexander Keung held his back. The other arresting officer, Tou Thao, stood by and watched. Floyd protested that he could not breathe. Under the circumstances, it is clear that Floyd posed no threat to anyone. Officer Chauvin continued kneeling on Floyd’s neck for 2 minutes and 53 seconds after Floyd had become unresponsive. When bystanders pleaded on Floyd’s behalf, they were threatened with being pepper-sprayed. Floyd was tortured to death. This was a lynching of a black man, pure and simple. Minneapolis Police Officer Derek Chauvin uses his knee to pin George Floyd's neck to the ground on Monday, May 25, 2020. Floyd, who said he couldn't breathe, later died. (Photo: Darnella Frazier Via Storyful) And, for what? He was accused of trying to pass a counterfeit bill at a deli. While one cannot justify passing counterfeit currency, if that is exactly what Floyd did, since when does that warrant a death sentence? And, since when do the police have the right to be judge, jury and executioner of the accused? The black and brown victims of police brutality are too numerous to name all of them, but here are a few: Sandra Bland Michael Brown Christian Cooper Sean Bell Oscar Grant Eric Garner Freddie Gray Yvonne Smallwood Philando Castille Tamir Rice Trayvon Martin was killed by George Zimmerman, who was not an actual police officer, but got off anyway. One of the most infamous of these cases was that of Amadou Diallo, an African immigrant who was shot 41 times by police officers of the New York City street crimes unit in 2000. What was his “crime?” When asked to show his identification he reached into his back pocket to retrieve his wallet. These cases are all disheartening and enraging at the same time. They are the reason for the demand that Black Lives Matter, which means that “Black Lives Also Matter,” not that ""Only Black Lives Matter."" If there is anything positive to take away from this it is that people of all races are speaking up about this. The movement for Black Lives is multi-racial. A woman cries as she joins protesters at Union Square in Manhattan on Saturday, May 30, 2020. Several thousand people rallied and marched through lower Manhattan to protest the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis earlier in the week. (Photo: Seth Harrison/The Journal News) After the killing of Amadou Diallo, Bruce Springsteen wrote a song in protest — called “American Skin (41 Shots).” The New York City PBA criticized Springsteen severely for this, but he did not back down. The organization 100 Blacks in Law Enforcement appreciated the song and supported Springsteen. As a white man, I have a duty to recognize that I benefit from white privilege whether I seek it or not in ways that are obvious and in others that are not so obvious. White people have a duty to educate other white people about white privilege and the importance of speaking out and standing with our black and brown sisters and brothers to demand justice for George Floyd and every other person of color who is wrongfully killed by the police. We must all demand equal justice under the law in every aspect.

His announcement came as police under federal command forced back peaceful demonstrators with tear gas so he could walk to a nearby church and pose with a Bible. A young boy holds a ""Justice"" sign as he peers outside the window of a car passing protesters marching through downtown for a third night of unrest Sunday May 31, 2020, in Richmond, Va. Gov. Ralph Northam issued a curfew for this evening. (AP Photo/Steve Helber) Trump's bellicose rhetoric came as the nation convulsed through another round of violence over the death of George Floyd at a time when the country is already buckling under the coronavirus outbreak and the Depression-level unemployment it has caused. The president demanded an end to the heated protests in remarks from the White House Rose Garden and vowed to use more force to achieve that aim. If governors throughout the country do not deploy the National Guard in sufficient numbers to ""dominate the streets,"" Trump said the U.S. military would step in to ""quickly solve the problem for them."" ""We have the greatest country in the world,"" the president declared. ""We're going to keep it safe."" A military deployment by Trump to U.S. states would mark a stunning federal intervention rarely seen in modern American history. Yet the message Trump appeared to be sending with the brazen pushback of protesters outside the White House was that he sees few limits to what he is willing to do. Some around the president likened the moment to 1968, when Richard Nixon ran as the law-and-order candidate in the aftermath of a summer of riots, capturing the White House. But despite his efforts to portray himself as a political outsider, Trump is an incumbent who risks being held responsible for the violence. Minutes before Trump began speaking, police and National Guard soldiers began aggressively forcing back hundreds of peaceful protesters who had gathered in Lafayette Park, across the street from the White House, where they were chanting against police brutality and Floyd's death in Minneapolis. As Trump spoke, tear gas canisters could be heard exploding. Floyd died last week after he was pinned to the pavement by a police officer who put his knee on the handcuffed black man's neck until he stopped breathing. His death set off protests that spread from Minneapolis across America. His brother Terrence pleaded with protesters on Monday to remain peaceful. Five months before Election Day, the president made clear that he would stake his reelection efforts on convincing voters that his strong-arm approach was warranted to quell the most intense civil unrest since the 1960s. He made little effort to address the grievances of black Americans and others outraged by Floyd's death and the scourge of police brutality, undermining what his campaign had hoped would be increased appeal to African American voters. The scene in and around the White House on Monday night appeared to be carefully orchestrated. As the crowd of protesters grew, Attorney General William Barr arrived in Lafayette Park to look over at the demonstrations and the swarm of law enforcement. The sudden shift in tactics against the protesters was initially a mystery. Then, after finishing his Rose Garden remarks, Trump emerged from the White House gates and walked through the park to St. John's Church, where an office had been set on fire the previous night. Trump, who rarely attends church, held up a Bible and gathered a group of advisers — all white — to pose for photos. The moment was quickly decried by Trump's critics, with New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo saying the president ""used the military to push out a peaceful protest so he could have a photo op at a church."" ""It's all just a reality TV show for this president,"" he said on Twitter. ""Shameful."" Federal law permits presidents to dispatch the military into states to suppress an insurrection or if a state is defying federal law, legal experts said. But Trump's statements also set up an immediate conflict with officials in New York and other states who asserted that the president does not have the unilateral right to send in troops against the will of local governments. The country has been beset by angry demonstrations for the past week in some of the most widespread racial unrest in the U.S. since the 1960s. Spurred largely by Floyd's death, protesters have taken to the streets to decry the killings of black people by police. Minneapolis Officer Derek Chauvin has been charged with murder, but protesters are demanding that three of his colleagues be prosecuted, too. All four were fired. While most of the demonstrations have been peaceful, others have descended into violence, leaving neighborhoods in shambles, stores ransacked, windows broken and cars burned, despite curfews around the country and the deployment of thousands of National Guard members in at least 15 states. On Monday, demonstrations erupted from Philadelphia, where hundreds of protesters spilled onto a highway in the heart of the city, to Atlanta, where police fired tear gas at demonstrators, to Nashville, where more than 60 National Guard soldiers put down their riot shields at the request of peaceful protesters who had gathered in front of Tennessee's state Capitol to honor Floyd. Two people were killed during protests in the Chicago suburb of Cicero, authorities said, but provided no details. In Louisville, Kentucky, riot police firing tear gas scattered several hundred protesters from downtown, violently capping a day of mostly peaceful protests. A vehicle plowed through a group of law enforcement officers at a demonstration in Buffalo, New York, injuring at least two. Video from the scene showed the vehicle accelerating through an intersection shortly after officers apparently tackled a protester and handcuffed him. The officers were hospitalized in stable condition, authorities said. In New York City, where nightfall has brought widespread scenes of destruction, large crowds rallied peacefully in Times Square and Brooklyn during the day. Then, in early evening, looters rushed into a Nike store in Manhattan and protesters smashed storefront windows near Rockefeller Center. Video posted on social media showed some protesters arguing with people breaking windows, urging them to stop. The city has already endured immense commercial damage from the unrest. On Monday, rioters got through the doors of the city's flagship Macy's store, famous for its Thanksgiving Day parade, and police later pulled at least two handcuffed men out of the store and put them into a van. By that time, most of the the street was littered with broken glass. In Washington, protesters continued marching peacefully through Washington hours after being forced from Lafayette park and past the 7 p.m. curfew. Eventually, within sight of the Capitol building, the marchers were turned back by law enforcement officers using tear gas, pellets and low-flying helicopters kicking up debris. As they dispersed, some protesters smashed windows at a nearby office building. Earlier Monday, Trump told the nation's governors in a video conference that they ""look like fools"" for not deploying even more National Guard troops. ""Most of you are weak,"" he said. He added: ""You've got to arrest people, you have to track people, you have to put them in jail for 10 years and you'll never see this stuff again."" Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, a Democrat, dismissed Trump's comments as the ""rantings of an insecure man trying to look strong after building his entire political career on racism."" Former Vice President Joe Biden, the Democratic presidential candidate, vowed to address institutional racism in his first 100 days in office. He met in person with black leaders in Delaware and also held a virtual meeting with big-city mayors. Biden said hate emerges ""when you have somebody in power who breathes oxygen into the hate."" In Minneapolis, meanwhile, Floyd's brother Terrence made an emotional plea for peace at the site where Floyd was arrested. ""Let's switch it up, y'all. Let's switch it up. Do this peacefully, please,"" Terrence Floyd said as he urged people to use their power at the ballot box. Also Monday, an autopsy commissioned for Floyd's family found that he died of asphyxiation from neck and back compression, the family's attorneys said. Authorities in many cities have blamed the violence on outside agitators, though have provided little evidence to back that up. But on Monday, federal authorities arrested a 28-year-old Illinois man saying he had posted self-recorded video on his Facebook page last week that showed him in Minneapolis handing out explosive devices and encouraging people to throw them at law enforcement officers. More than 5,600 people nationwide have been arrested over the past week for such offenses as stealing, blocking highways and breaking curfew, according to a count by The Associated Press. ___ Sullivan and Morrison reported from Minneapolis.

Prior to next week's event, separate memorial services in Minnesota and North Carolina will be held. Former boxing champion Floyd Mayweather will pay the expenses of all three events after the former boxing champion's offer of assistance was accepted by the family. It was another day of protests accross the country. Moments after police in riot gear tried to disperse a crowd of peaceful protesters at Lafayette Square across from the White House, President Donald Trump said the civil disturbances that have erupted across the nation since George Floyd's killing on Memorial Day would be quelled. Under heavy protection, Trump and several members of his administration, including Attorney General William Barr, walked across the park to St. John's Church and posed for photos before returning to the White House. Earlier in the day, Floyd's relatives demanded further punishment for those involved in his death after an independent autopsy requested by the family concluded he was killed by asphyxiation from sustained pressure. The Hennepin County medical examiner later ruled the death a homicide. A closer look at some recent developments: George Floyd's funeral will be held on June 9 in Houston, Texas. Attorney General William Barr has deployed federal riot teams to Washington, D.C., and Miami in an attempt to quell violent clashes between protesters and police. Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo apologized to Floyd's family Sunday, saying that firing Chauvin and the other three officers involved in the Memorial Day confrontation was the right thing to do. What we're reading today: How did we get here? A timeline of events leading up to the nationwide outcry against Floyd's death. Our live blog will be updated throughout the day. For first-in-the-morning updates, sign up for the Daily Briefing. Here's the latest news: Floyd's funeral to be held June 9 in Houston Family attorney Benjamin Crump on Monday said funeral services for Floyd will be held June 9 in Houston. There will be a public viewing next Monday in Texas, Crump said. Crump added there will be two separate memorial services for Floyd. One will take place Thursday in Minneapolis at North Central University. The other will be in Clinton, North Carolina on Saturday. Both memorial services will run from 1 p.m. until 3 p.m. Boxer Floyd Mayweather will pay for Floyd's funeral and memorial services after the family accepted his offer of support. The former world champion has not met Floyd's family, according to Leonard Ellerbe, the CEO of Mayweather Promotions. Protesters tear-gassed as Trump vows to end riots Calling himself ""your president of law and order,'' President Donald Trump vowed to put an end to the disturbances that have broken out in many parts of the country following the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis a week ago. ""As we speak, I am dispatching thousands and thousands of heavily armed soldiers, military personnel and law enforcement officers to stop the rioting, looting, vandalism, assaults and the wanton destruction of property,'' Trump said in a brief late-afternoon statement at the Rose Garden. Before Trump and his aides walked across Lafayette Park, police pushed away a crowd of protesters -- many of them holding up their hands and saying, ""Don't shoot'' -- using shields, horses and tear gas to disperse them. Trump's address came as hundreds of demonstrators surrounded the White House grounds for the fourth day of protests in Washington, D.C. Family autopsy shows Floyd suffocated; death ruled homicide An autopsy conducted Sunday at the request of George Floyd's relatives showed he suffocated to death because of neck and back pressure that cut off blood flow to his brain and kept him from breathing, a statement by the family lawyers said. The family is demanding first-degree murder charges against Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, who is shown on a video pressing his knee against Floyd's neck for more than eight minutes, and the arrest of the other three officers at the scene. “What we found is consistent with what people saw. There is no other health issue that could cause or contribute to the death,” Dr. Michael Baden, one of the forensic pathologists hired by the family, said in the statement. “Police have this false impression that if you can talk, you can breathe. That’s not true.” Floyd is heard on the video repeatedly saying he couldn't breathe. ""The independent examiners found that weight on the back, handcuffs and positioning were contributory factors because they impaired the ability of Mr. Floyd’s diaphragm to function,'' the statement says. ""From all the evidence, the doctors said it now appears Mr. Floyd died at the scene.'' The Hennepin County medical examiner classified the death as a homicide and said Floyd had a ""cardiopulmonary arrest while being restrained by law enforcement officer(s).'' The report also noted ""fentanyl intoxication'' and ""recent methamphetamine use'' detected on Floyd. Two Atlanta police officers have been fired after being accused of excessive use of force during a George Floyd protest. President Donald Trump said he would designate antifa as a terror organization and blamed the group for violence at George Floyd protests. Floyd's brother calls for peaceful protests Wearing a mask that read ""We can't breathe'' on one half and ""Justice for George Floyd'' on the other, his brother Terrence Floyd on Monday exhorted demonstrators in Minneapolis to keep his memory alive but to protest in a peaceful manner. Terrence Floyd chastised those responsible for the violence and looting that have marred many of the protests over his brother's Memorial Day death while in the custody of Minneapolis police, saying those acts didn't accomplish anything positive. ""My family is a peaceful family. My family is God-fearing,'' Terrence Floyd told a crowd, pointing out rioters may be destroying their own communities. ""Let's do this another way.'' Floyd urged those in attendance at a makeshift memorial to learn about the candidates for public office and to get out and vote. ""Educate yourselves. Don't wait for somebody else to tell you who's who,'' Floyd said. ""Educate yourself and know who you're voting for. That's how we're going to help. It's a lot of us! ... Let's switch it up and do this peacefully.'' The crowd, which had earlier chanted, ""Lock them all four!'' in reference to the four police officers at the scene of George Floyd's killing, later changed to a different chant with a similar message: ""One down, three to go.'' Though all four officers have been fired, only Derek Chauvin has been arrested and charged with murder. Trump derides governors as 'weak': 'You have to arrest people' President Donald Trump slammed the nation’s governors Monday as “weak” and demanded tougher crackdowns on protesters following another night of violence. Trump spoke to governors on a video teleconference with law enforcement and national security officials, telling the local leaders they “have to get much tougher” amid nationwide protests and criticizing their responses. “Most of you are weak,” Trump said. “You have to arrest people.” More than 4,400 hundred arrests have been made across the nation in sometimes-violent protests since George Floyd's death on Memorial Day. Disturbing sight: Vehicles ramming protesters The sight of vehicles ramming into crowds of protesters in at least three major cities has added a disturbing element that further stoked tensions during demonstrations over the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. In New York, two police vehicles drove into protesters behind a barricade. Demonstrators in Denver chased a black SUV after a woman drove through a crowd and accelerated as a man hopped on the hood. A semi-truck driver was arrested after video showed the truck driving into a crowd of peaceful demonstrators in Minneapolis on Interstate 35, which had been closed to traffic. It's unclear how many vehicles were aimed at demonstrators, but witnesses said that the incidents seemed intentional and that the drivers accelerated as they went through the crowds. -- Ryan W. Miller Louisville police chief fired after another killing Greg Fischer, mayor of Louisville, Kentucky, said Monday that Metro Police Chief Steve Conrad has been fired in the wake of the law-enforcement killing of the owner of a barbecue establishment. Fischer also said a nightly curfew from 9 p.m.-to-6:30 a.m. has been extended to June 8. Gov. Andy Beshear ordered Kentucky State Police to investigate the fatal shooting by police and National Guard personnel. The man killed was David McAtee, owner of a barbecue business next to a food mart parking lot where the shooing took place, according to his nephew. Police and National Guard troops, who have been monitoring protests, were breaking up a ""large crowd"" in the food mart's parking lot around 12:15 a.m. local time Monday when someone shot at them, Conrad said. They returned fire, killing McAtee. No one else was injured. -- Billy Kobin, Louisville Courier Journal Protests may lead to coronavirus outbreaks Protests can be ""breeding grounds'' for the coronavirus, said Harvard University epidemiologist Dr. Michael Mina, among the health experts concerned that the close proximity among demonstrators could lead to more cases of COVID-19. Focus on the disease has diminished lately as media focus has shifted to the widespread riots sparked by the death of George Floyd at the hands of a Minneapolis police officer. However, the virus remains a major threat, and it's more likely to spread among people not wearing masks and standing close to each other, as has often been the case at protests. ""There's no doubt in my mind that these can become breeding grounds for this virus,"" Mina said. ""I would not be surprised to see in the next couple of weeks that we see increases that may be linked to protests."" Ken Alltucker and Karen Weintraub Chicago mayor: Violence, looting 'spread like a wildfire' Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot on Monday vehemently denied claims that she protected the city's downtown area at the expense of neighborhoods devastated by looting and vandalism Sunday night. Chicago officials, stung by nights of violence, had shut down most streets and transit headed downtown Sunday. Several city aldermen called on Lightfoot to increase National Guard numbers to 3,000, from the current 375, and to send them into neighborhoods. Chicago Police Supt. David Brown has said his officers are better suited for community duty. Lightfoot said she ""did not stand by and let the South and West sides burn."" “The fact is that the violence that we saw and the looting that we saw spread like a wildfire,"" she said. Police chiefs must hold officers accountable, law enforcement group says George Floyd's death was ""unnecessary, avoidable and criminal,"" the Major Cities Chiefs Association said in a statement Monday. The group, whose members include police executives from the largest cities in the United States and Canada, says it can be honest about its law enforcement history dating back over two centuries ""that has included institutional racism"" including violence against African Americans seeking equal rights. The statement says every major city chief must take every action ""within their legal authority"" to hold officers accountable. ""We need to hear what America is telling us right now,"" the statement said. ""We need to take bold and courageous action to change the narrative of our history as it relates to the disparate impact and outcomes that policing has had – and continues to have – on African Americans, people of color and the disenfranchised."" Federal riot teams sent to Washington after damage near White House Riot teams are being sent to Washington, D.C, and Miami from the federal Bureau of Prisons. The FBI also has directed its elite Hostage Rescue Unit to help in D.C., a senior Justice Department official said Monday.The federal prison riot team arrived in Miami on Sunday. A weekend of rioting in the nation’s capital left deep scars in the shadow of the White House and across the city where 88 people have been arrested, while dozens of law enforcement officers were injured, including Secret Service agents. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser announced a 7 p.m. curfew Monday. She said significant damage was done around the White House on Sunday. There was also a fire at the historic St. John's Church across from the White House. – Kevin Johnson In New York: Police cars burn, no curfew planned, mayor's daughter arrested Setting a curfew in New York City to help curb violent protests would be a pointless exercise doomed to failure, Police Commissioner Dermot Shea said Monday. Police cars burned and several officers were injured in clashes Sunday night, the fourth consecutive night of violence in the city. Mayor Bill de Blasio, whose daughter Chiara was among almost 1,000 people arrested since Thursday, said NYPD officers ""showed restraint"" amid the mayhem. De Blasio also downplayed the value of a curfew. Shea, speaking on the ""Today"" show, said a curfew would be ignored and extremely difficult to enforce. “The problem is, people need to listen to a curfew and that’s not going to happen,"" Shea said. ""And if people think it will, they don’t understand what’s going on."" More news about the George Floyd protests Journalists attacked by officers, protesters As protests across the nation turn violent, members of the news media have been caught in the crossfire – or targeted. The Committee to Protect Journalists said it is investigating reports of attacks and arrests in Louisville, Kentucky, Las Vegas, Atlanta and Washington, D.C. In Iowa on Sunday, police arrested reporter Andrea Sahouri of the Des Moines Register, part of the USA TODAY Network, on charges of failure to disperse while she was covering a demonstration that turned violent. Sahouri said police sprayed her in the face with pepper spray after she identified herself as a member of the media. ""I'm press. I'm press. I'm press,"" she said she told police. Carlos Martínez de la Serna, program director of the Committee to Protect Journalists, said targeted attacks on journalists covering the demonstrations ""show a complete disregard for their critical role in documenting issues of public interest and are an unacceptable attempt to intimidate them."" – Lorenzo Reyes 3 dead in confrontations with authorities in Kentucky, Iowa Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear authorized state police to conduct an independent investigation after Louisville Metro Police and National Guard personnel fatally shot a man early Monday. Police Chief Steve Conrad said someone in the group gathered after the 9 p.m. curfew fired at the law enforcement personnel, who returned fire. In Davenport, Iowa, two people were killed in multiple shootings after rioting broke out, the police chief said at a news conference Monday. Chief Paul Sikorski said police responded Sunday night to disturbances near a mall involving 100 vehicles and ""rioters."" Over the next several hours, police responded to dozens of confirmed shots-fired incidents, including one where officers were ambushed and one was shot, Sikorski said. One officer was shot, one officer returned fire and several rounds hit the officers' vehicle. ""They were not like they protests and demonstrations Saturday,"" Sikorski said. ""What we experienced tonight, last night was completely unacceptable and it does not honor the memory of Mr. Floyd."" – Philip Joens, Des Moines Register; Billy Kobin, Louisville Courier Journal 2 Atlanta officers fired, accused of excessive force against protesters Atlanta officials fired two police officers and placed three on desk duty pending review over the alleged use of excessive force against protesters in a clash Saturday night. Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said she saw a video, which she called ""disturbing,"" of five officers pulling two college students out of a car downtown. Bottoms and police Chief Erika Shields made the announcement at a press conference after reviewing body-camera footage. ""We understand that our officers are working very long hours under an enormous amount of stress,"" Bottoms said.

Phil Scott said on Monday that the four Minneapolis police officers involved in the killing of George Floyd should be prosecuted, as he also called for protesters in Vermont to keep the peace, and announced the launch of a racial equity task force to explore policies to combat systemic racism.  Hundreds of protesters turned out in Burlington and Montpelier on Saturday as part of nationwide protests and riots sparked by the killing of Floyd. Scott said the anger was justified, and noted that he had joined the Vermont State Police in condemning the police actions.  “Mr Floyd’s death, under their watch, under an officer’s knee, is barbaric and totally inexcusable,” Scott said in remarks at the start of his Monday press conference.

Sign up free. “It’s my belief they should all be charged and tried for murder and held fully accountable,” Scott said, “both the three officers who used force, the the officer who stood by and allowed it to occur.”  “In the greatest country in the world,” Scott continued, “no one should stand for this. No one should make excuses for this. And no one should ignore this.”  The governor noted that many Vermonters are joining in the calls for justice. “And I respect those who are doing so,” he said. “I only ask that you do so peacefully and safely, especially considering the public health crisis we’re facing.”  Health Commissioner Mark Levine briefly noted his concern over the size of the protests in Vermont — the governor is increasing the allowable crowd size from 10 to 25 on Monday — while also noting that many participants were wearing face masks. Vermont’s public safety commissioner, Michael Schirling, said the incident in Minneapolis “looks like something that if it were happening here we would be investigating and referring for prosecution.”  He added that such action has no place in Vermont’s police force. “If you’re in this job for any other reason than community service with empathy and to provide a requisite level of protection to those who need it, you should be looking elsewhere,” he said. “We’re past the point where this is something we should be discussing.”  VTDigger is underwritten by: Scott was asked about President Donald Trump’s remarks today — after fires burned outside the White House last night — in which he told governors they should “dominate” protesters, adding they would look like “jerks” if rioters were not arrested and jailed “for long periods of time.”  “I don’t think the president’s words are reflective of reality,” Scott said. “I believe that we should be leading by example. And, obviously, there are some situations where you have to use more force. But this wasn’t one of them for us here over the weekend.”  Asked if he thought Trump should address the nation, Scott said: “Well, maybe not with that attitude.”  Scott said events like Floyd’s killing cannot be seen as “an uncomfortable and rare event,” and need to be viewed as part of systemic racism that is “built into our school systems, economic systems and everything in between.”  To that end, the governor announced the creation of a Racial Equity Task Force, which will be charged with looking at the racial disparity in Covid-19 infection and death rates — and what Vermont can do to close the gap.  He said the task force will also evaluate whether Vermont is doing enough to support a racially diverse population, and will review state and federal hate speech laws as part of efforts to “encourage all Vermonters, from a range of racial and ethnic groups, to run and serve in public office at all levels.”  Demonstrators gather at Battery Park in Burlington to protest the deaths of George Floyd and other people of color at the hands of police on Saturday, May 30. Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDigger Kiah Morris, who was Vermont’s only black female lawmaker, stepped out of politics in 2018, citing continued racial harassment as a driving factor. She has recently taken a new job as the movement politics director for the liberal advocacy group Rights & Democracy.  Xusana Davis, who was appointed by Scott as Vermont’s first director of racial equity — a position that Morris played a foundational role in creating — also spoke at Monday’s press conference about the importance, in one of the whitest states of America, of everyone accepting their responsibility for stamping out white supremacy.  “I always try to ask people to remember white privilege doesn’t mean that your life isn’t hard. It means that your skin color isn’t one of the things making it harder,” Davis said, noting that she had seen signs at recent protests saying “white silence equals violence.”  “And it’s really important I think for white people to recognize that tacit approval, or rather silence, on the matter of white supremacy only aids and furthers the systems of white supremacy that are in play,” she said. 📈 Get the latest statistics and live updates on our coronavirus page. 📫 Sign up for our coronavirus email list. 🗣️ Tell us your story or give feedback at [email protected] ❓ Get answers to FAQs in our Covid-19 knowledge base. 🛒 See what’s open near you in our business directory. 🙏 Support our nonprofit journalism with a donation.

1622451748,2020-06-01 12:48:23.474569,Biden meets with black leaders at church amid unrest,https://www.wcax.com/content/news/Biden-meets-with-black-leaders-at-church-amid-unrest-570921841.html,en,True,"politics and government, united states politics and government, elections, blacks, demonstrations and riots",69923,wcax.com,http://www.wcax.com/#spider,"WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) — Joe Biden vowed to address institutional racism in his first 100 days in office as he sought to elevate his voice Monday in the exploding national debate over racism and police brutality. Former Vice President Joe Biden bows his head in prayer as he visits Bethel AME Church in Wilmington, Del., Monday, June 1, 2020. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik) The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee offered emotional support and promised bold action during an in-person discussion with black leaders in Delaware and a subsequent virtual meeting with big-city mayors who are grappling with racial tensions and frustrated by a lack of federal support. ""Hate just hides. It doesn't go away, and when you have somebody in power who breathes oxygen into the hate under the rocks, it comes out from under the rocks,"" Biden told more than a dozen African American leaders gathered at a church in downtown Wilmington, his face mask lowered around his chin as he spoke. Without offering specifics, he promised to ""deal with institutional racism"" and set up a police oversight body in his first 100 days in office, if elected. The former vice president also said he'd be releasing an economic plan focused on education, housing and ""access to capital"" and investments, especially for minority Americans, later this month. ""I really do believe that the blinders have been taken off. I think this tidal wave is moving,"" Biden told the mayors of Atlanta, Chicago, Los Angeles and St. Paul, Minnesota. ""I realize we've got to do something big, we can do it, and everyone will benefit from it."" Largely sheltering in place amid the coronavirus, Biden has struggled in recent weeks to be heard from his makeshift home TV studio over the noise of dueling national crises. But after another night of violent protests, he ventured out into public for the second time in two days and just the third time since the pandemic arrived in mid-March. His hopeful and collaborative approach marked a sharp contrast to that of President Donald Trump, who has made little effort to unify the country. The Republican president slammed governors as ""weak"" during a video teleconference on Monday and demanded tougher crackdowns on protesters. Trump also lashed out at Biden on Twitter, writing that ""Sleepy Joe Biden's people are so Radical Left that they are working to get the Anarchists out of jail, and probably more."" Biden's softer style may foreshadow how he presents himself in the five months before the presidential election, emphasizing calm and competence as a contrast to a mercurial president. It is an approach that carries the risk of being drowned out by Trump's much louder voice. On Monday evening, Trump declared himself ""the president of law and order"" from the White House as military police and law enforcement fired tear gas and cleared protesters from nearby Lafayette Park. Biden made no mention of the unfolding events during an online fundraiser that took place at the same time, though he talked at length about persistent racism in the U.S. He plans to deliver remarks on the unrest gripping the U.S. on Tuesday in Philadelphia. In the early moments of Monday's gathering at the Bethel AME church in Wilmington, Biden listened quietly and took notes. All the attendees, including Biden, wore face masks but lowered them as they spoke. ""The vice president came to hear from us. This is a homeboy,"" pastor Sylvester Beaman said before everyone bowed their heads in prayer. Biden's standing with the black community weighs heavily as he works to deny Trump a second term. African Americans rescued Biden's flailing primary campaign, but it's unclear if they will turn out for him in large numbers in November. ""I want to make something clear. I don't expect anything from the black community,"" Biden said Monday, insisting he has never taken its support for granted. The former vice president has been doing cleanup since telling a prominent black radio host a week and a half ago that African Americans who back Trump ""ain't black."" Yet the mayors who spoke with Biden, three of whom are black, were clearly frustrated and angry with Trump, who has offered military support to address violent protests while denying them federal support to address the coronavirus fallout and repeatedly attacking them on social media. ""To see the president of the United States say that he's going to send the military into our communities but hadn't mentioned sending a single dime of support into our communities, speaks to where we are in America,"" said Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms. Much of Biden's campaign strategy centers on trying to draw a contrast with Trump on temperament and values. He has called the White House contest a battle for the soul of the nation and has been particularly forceful in condemning Trump's handling of moments of racial tension. In an election that is likely to be a referendum on the sitting president, some Biden aides say privately that the best plan may be to let Trump do himself in. Yet there is also a recognition that Biden needs to do more than simply wait for voters who may be turned off by Trump to turn toward him. Some Democrats who have criticized Biden for not being more visible during the onset of the coronavirus said he is making the right moves now. ""I'm sure they have some reluctance, understandably, right now to politicize it. That's not who he is,"" said Democratic strategist James Carville. ""There might be a time for eloquence, but I think that simplicity is eloquence right now."" ___ Jaffe reported from Washington; Peoples reported from Montclair, New Jersey.

Protestors line the intersection of 72nd and Dodge on Friday, May 29, 2020, in Omaha to protest the death of George Floyd on Monday night after a Minneapolis Police officer knelt on his neck. (Emily Dwire / WOWT) “Decedent experienced a cardiopulmonary arrest while being restrained by law enforcement officer(s),” the Hennepin County Medical Examiner's Office said in a news release. Cause of death was listed as “cardiopulmonary arrest complicating law enforcement subdual, restraint and neck compression.” Under ""other significant conditions” it said Floyd suffered from heart disease and hypertension, and listed fentanyl intoxication and recent methamphetamine use. Those factors were not listed under cause of death. A Minneapolis police officer was charged last week with third-degree murder in Floyd’s death, and three other officers were fired. Bystander video showed the officer, Derek Chauvin, holding his knee on Floyd’s neck despite the man's cries that he can't breathe until he eventually stopped moving. A separate autopsy commissioned for Floyd’s family also called his death a homicide. It concluded that that he died of asphyxiation due to neck and back compression, said the family’s attorney, Ben Crump, who called for the charge against Chauvin to be upgraded to first-degree murder and for three other officers to be charged. He didn't say what the charges against the other officers should be. That autopsy, by a forensic pathologist who also examined Eric Garner’s body, found the compression cut off blood to Floyd’s brain, and that the pressure of other officers' knees on his back made it impossible for him to breathe, Crump said. Both the medical examiner and the family’s experts differed from the description in last week’s criminal complaint against the officer of how Floyd died. The complaint, citing preliminary findings from the medical examiner, listed the effects of being restrained, along with underlying health issues and potential intoxicants in Floyd’s system. But it also said nothing was found “to support a diagnosis of traumatic asphyxia or strangulation.” Neither side has released its full autopsy report so far. The family's autopsy found no evidence of heart disease and concluded he had been healthy. Floyd, a black man who was in handcuffs at the time, died after Chauvin, who is white, ignored bystander shouts to get off Floyd and Floyd's cries that he couldn't breathe. His death sparked days of protests in Minneapolis and around America. The complaint provided no details about intoxicants. In the 911 call that drew police, the caller described the man suspected of paying with counterfeit money as “awfully drunk and he’s not in control of himself.” Floyd’s family and attorneys, like the families of other black men killed by police, commissioned their own autopsy because they didn’t trust local authorities to produce an unbiased report. The family's autopsy was done by Michael Baden and Allecia Wilson. Baden is the former chief medical examiner of New York City, and was hired to do an autopsy of Garner, a black man who died in 2014 after New York police placed him in a chokehold and he pleaded that he could not breathe. Baden also did an autopsy at the family's request for Michael Brown, an 18-year-old shot by police in Ferguson, Missouri. He said Brown didn’t reveal signs of a struggle, casting doubt on a claim by police that a struggle between Brown and the officer led to the shooting. Dr. Judy Melinek, a forensic pathologist from the San Francisco Bay area who blogs about the subject and is not connected with the case, said the key difference between the medical examiner's conclusions and those of Baden and Walker are the official finding of “significant” conditions for Floyd, including heart disease and drugs in his system. Baden and Wilson acknowledged on a conference call with reporters that they didn't have access to the tissue samples that the medical examiner kept that might have given more information on his health. Nor did they have their own toxicology results yet. Melinek said it's not unusual for different pathologists to reach different determinations, given that they may be looking at different information and that they've had different experiences and training. Under the law, a medical examiner determines the cause and manner of death, but it's up to prosecutors to decide whether criminal charges are warranted. The term homicide means only that a person's death was caused by another person. Chauvin, who was also charged with manslaughter, is being held in a state prison. The other three officers on scene, like Chauvin, were fired the day after the incident but have not been charged. The head of the Minneapolis police union said in a letter to members that the officers were fired without due process and labor attorneys are fighting for their jobs. Lt. Bob Kroll, the union president, also criticized city leadership, saying a lack of support is to blame for the days of sometimes violent protests. When asked to respond, Mayor Jacob Frey said Kroll's opposition to reform and lack of empathy for the community has undermined trust in the police. Gov. Tim Walz announced Sunday that Attorney General Keith Ellison would take the lead in any prosecutions in Floyd's death. Local civil rights activists have said Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman doesn't have the trust of the black community. They have protested outside his house, and pressed him to charge the other three officers. Freeman remains on the case. ___ Associated Press writer Doug Glass contributed.

New orders for the city's police arrive as tensions rise across the United States over the death of George Floyd, who died after a Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee onto the back of Floyd's neck for more than eight minutes. The death of Floyd, who was African American, has led to nationwide outrage and protests against police brutality, including in Burlington. An action in the city Saturday included criticisms of the Burlington police. More: Black Lives Matter: Burlington crowd protests for George Floyd, marches to police parking lot More: 'Perfect storm' of civil unrest following George Floyd's death unique, effective, experts say ""The special committee on policing that we set up last year noted that the duty to intervene is not explicitly and clearly part of our current use-of-force policy,"" said Mayor Miro Weinberger during his Monday briefing. ""Or at least, it was not before today."" Reforms have been delayed by the pandemic, he said. New orders for Burlington police Two orders will remain in place until the issuance of the updated use-of-force policy, said Interim Police Chief Jennifer Morrison. ""Candidly, we're ready to roll,"" she said of an updated policy during the briefing. The orders, as explained by Morrison, are: All personnel are required to intervene when they witness excessive use of force, misconduct or another violation of a department policy or rule. De-escalation should always be prioritized in any use-of-force scenario if safe and officers must be aware of their own ability to increase the level of force needed, taking care to avoid any unnecessary escalations. The memorandum also reiterates existing directives about officers not using more force than reasonably necessary and how they should handle reports of corruption and misconduct. ""I think that's an important way just to reassure the community that we're not just making the assumption that this will never happen in Burlington,"" she said. ""I don't believe it will ever happen in Burlington."" VTDigger's Aidan Quigley asked about the city council's agenda — which includes an update on use-of-force litigation — and specifically pointed to Officer Jason Bellavance. Bellavance was accused of excessive force after a downtown incident in September 2018, when he pushed a member of the public, who subsequently hit his head against a wall. More: Burlington police accused of excessive force that resulted in men being knocked unconscious ""This is an incident that is well behind us,"" Morrison said during the briefing. She said Quigley tried to conflate the incident with Bellavance with the one in Minneapolis and pushed to move forward instead of looking back.

Organized by Sara Stowell and Susan Brace, the gathering got under way at 5:30 p.m. and within minutes groups of demonstrators descended on the library. After the initial dozen set up on the south side of Main Street, younger people arrived and took up places at the park on the opposite side of the street. Stowell told The Telegraph that people felt particularly strongly about the issue of oppression of black people, which she said isn’t strictly an urban problem. Small town residents, she said, are paying attention and are horrified and appalled. “I am so happy to see so many young people here,” said Stowell. Many motorists passing the demonstration honked horns and waived while — at the end of the block — a Ludlow Police officer watched from his cruiser.

She is poet with an MFA from the Vermont College of Fine Arts.  I admit I have painted Vermont with broad strokes of Bernie Sanders, farmers’ rights, and environmental policies. Vermont, it’s the place people think of for making good policy by progressive-minded people. But I’m white. Things looked differently at the Black Lives Matter protest in Burlington last night.  Get all of VTDigger's daily news. You'll never miss a story with our daily headlines in your inbox. My family and I, masked, stood in the back listening to the speakers and poets voice their pain and frustration at the systematic white supremacy that killed George Floyd. We all spoke the names of victims. We held silence. And then something happened. The lead organizer, Harmony Edosomwan, was verbally attacked off-stage by a group of unmasked white anti-protesters. Back on the stage, Edosomwan turned to the crowd and told us what happened and what didn’t. Not one of the white bystanders stopped the harassers. It came down to the black community nearby to protect her. She was very clear, “White people ain’t here for us!”  There were multiple reports of the protests for George Floyd in Vermont. Not one to date has mentioned this incident. Reporters are focusing on Edosomwan’s confrontation at Burlington police department. There she asked Police Chief Jen Morrison about the series of accusations against Burlington police for brutality against people of color. And I get it. I get why the focus is on the police, since it was the police in Minneapolis who killed George Floyd. I also get this is the coverage we are handed because it is a simple story: Protesters vs. Police.  But inside the protest, it wasn’t that simple. There were those who were there for their own experience, not the betterment and safety of the most vulnerable. And let me be explicit: Those most vulnerable to Covid19 and systematic racism is the black community. The white liberal Vermonters standing by — holding up George Floyd posters while Harmony Edosomwan was berated by aggressive unmasked strangers — they are complicit and culpable. It’s not George Floyd over there. It’s happening, and happened right here.  The white liberal Vermonter wants to stay safe while feeling good. They want to protest the death of George Floyd but not the white supremacy literally within reach. They want to attend a protest but stand idly by when an opportunity to become an ally arises. It’s not Black Lives Matter but perhaps more truthfully White Experience Matters. Sadly, Edosomwan’s message to the people of color in the crowd, that white people, white liberals of Vermont are not here for them, feels very true. They were there to protest for peace. That kind of peace that makes white folks feel less guilty.  After the speakers at Battery Park, protesters carried on to the police station. My family and I walked back to the car. Walking silently, it was easy for us to hear the group of white college students behind us. A young, unmasked man, touting his privilege of health, not considering those around him, complained about the speeches at Battery Park. “To be honest, I’m disappointed by the speakers. They didn’t even really prepare. I mean, the poems were good, but I was looking for something better. I wish I could have heard someone like Martin Luther King speak tonight. And why was she so mad at us, saying white people weren’t there for black people? Why did she have to attack us?”  Edosomwan was right. Some white people weren’t there for her. They were there to, yet again, commodify the black experience so they could feel something. So distanced and protected from their pain and culpability of being a part of a divisive system, they came for relief, not to hold space. Not to support or lift the black community of Burlington or of minorities in greater Vermont. It also feels like the media would rather brush the divide at Battery Park under the rug too.  VTDigger is underwritten by: Vermont, here’s the deal: People vote in police commissioners. People are police. People are police chiefs. People call police on innocent black people. And as we saw last night, people, white liberal people, stand by while black activists are verbally assaulted.  Vermont, we’ve got a problem, and it’s not just the police.  Share Email 0 Shares",0.0

Dr. Arnold Isidore Thomas, who is pastor of Good Shepherd Lutheran Church in Jericho, moderator of the Racism in America Forums and former conference minister of the Vermont Conference of the United Church of Christ (the first black denominational leader in the state). What white Americans refer to as a crisis, black Americans call business as usual. The murders of Breonna Taylor in Kentucky, Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia, and George Floyd in Minnesota are but the latest in an ongoing cycle of violence toward black people that have plagued this nation since its inception. The present racial crisis our nation is experiencing, intensified by the devastation the coronavirus pandemic is having upon black and brown communities, is the consequence of a culture that has placed capital over compassion and property over people. And until we as citizens commit ourselves to placing the priorities of the most oppressed, marginalized and victimized communities as our uppermost priorities, then this crisis will only worsen.  Black and brown people in Vermont feel taken for granted because we comprise less than 6% of the population, causing state and local officials to disregard or ignore matters we consider crucial to our survival. Still, the few, but growing, representative voices we have continue to work within the legal apparatus of the state in stressing the need for all residents to pay attention to the daily desperation many of us, along with poor white people, face with the reminder that when you empower the most vulnerable members of our society, we all benefit.  Get all of VTDigger's daily news. You'll never miss a story with our daily headlines in your inbox. When a country fails to implement fair and impartial policing on local, regional and national levels, we will continue to experience abuses by law enforcement officials. When a country fails to feel outraged by the disproportionate number of people of color in our nation’s correctional facilities, we will continue to experience injustice on all levels of our criminal justice system. When the nation’s highest court continues to dismantle the structure of civil rights legislation for which thousands fought and died, and the nation’s chief executive leads the charge of his party to suppress the voting rights of people of color, we will continue to experience civil unrest and violence in every region and state. When a nation turns a deaf ear to the cries of the poor and oppressed for quality education, employment, housing and health care, all the protest rallies and speeches will amount to nothing. In other words, “If I speak in the tongues of mortals and angels, but have not love, I am a noisy gong and a clashing cymbal.” (1st Corinthians 1:1)  The increasing numbers of black and brown people across the nation and in Vermont have also increased in their intolerance of noisy-gong-and-clashing-cymbal-like rhetoric of whites who momentarily raise their voices against what they see as a momentary crisis and then resume their lives supporting and sustaining the systemic racism that caused it.  Life will only change for the better, for all of us, when we take seriously the sacred creed that all are created equal; that we are endowed by our Creator with certain inalienable right; “that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness;” but further, that “whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form” (Declaration of Independence). Life will only change for the better, and for all of us, when the power to interpret these principles and pursue these rights is wrenched from the grip of the wealthy few to become the commonwealth of all.  I urge Vermonters to take action by pressuring their local and state officials to move on initiatives and legislation uppermost in the lives of black and brown people, including:  The call for civilian oversight of law enforcement. A statewide policy and procedure for the use of force by police (Senate Bill 119, House Bill 464). Reparations for slavery (House Bill 478). Justice systemwide data collection. Implementation of Act 54 requiring the Attorney General’s Office, the Human Rights Commission, along with other interested stakeholders to develop a strategy to address racial disparities across all systems of state government. Designating a portion of Covid-19 funds to address the severe and disproportionate impact on people of color within the state. Choosing select boards, city councils, mayors, police chiefs, state and national officials that embrace these priorities. Most of all, I urge Vermonters to not feel powerless in their ability to change the ongoing crisis we face. Our inaction created this crisis. Our proactive engagement will turn the tide to favor us all.  Share Email 91 Shares",0.0

Phil Scott called on residents to confront and dismantle racism in the state. “We can fix this without waiting for a vaccine,” Scott said at a press conference. “It just takes us uniting to make this a better country for everyone. Because like the coronavirus, this is literally in our hands.” Scott issued the call during his thrice-weekly press conference, which typically serves as an update on the state’s actions to address the COVID-19 pandemic. However, Monday’s press conference largely focused on how the state is responding to the nationwide outrage sparked last week by the death of George Floyd — a black man in Minneapolis who died after a white police officer kneeled on his neck for several minutes. The incident has led to protests across the country, including a rally in Burlington that drew hundreds of people on Saturday. And while Scott said he hoped protests in Vermont would remain peaceful, he also expressed empathy with the protesters. More from VPR: Crowd Confronts Burlington Police During Protest For George Floyd ""It's important to reflect on a quote from Dr. Martin Luther King who said, 'A riot is the language of the unheard,'"" Scott said. ""They simply do not know what else to do. And for those who see the national protests and feel distain instead of sympathy, just know the reactions we're seeing in cities around the country are the results of decades, actually centuries, of calls for help that went unheard."" Scott called the actions of the Minneapolis police “barbaric” and said all four officers involved in the death of George Floyd should be charged with murder. Currently only one officer has been charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. “No one should make excuses for this, and no one should ignore this,” Scott said. "" ... for those who see the national protests and feel distain instead of sympathy, just know the reactions we're seeing in cities around the country are the results of decades, actually centuries, of calls for help that went unheard."" ⁠— Gov. Phil Scott Vermont State Police and Burlington Police have also condemned the actions of the officers in Minneapolis. Public Safety Commissioner Michael Schirling said the recent events have accelerated state plans to update police training, including integrating more de-escalation tactics into the curriculum. “I think you’ll see more of that accelerate as we begin to run even faster at our modernization efforts,” Schirling said. At the press conference, Scott also announced the launch of a statewide task force focused on racial inequity, an initiative that had previously been in the works. The group will first focus on disparities in the state’s COVID-19 infections. According to the Health Department, African American Vermonters have the highest rates of COVID-19, and the state’s death rate is higher among racial minorities. More from VPR: Vermont's Deputy Health Commissioner On COVID-19 Data Collection, Demographic Trends Scott said the task force will eventually address other issues. “It will review current state and federal law on hate speech and contemplate ways to encourage Vermonters from a range of racial and ethnic groups to run and serve in public office at all levels,” he said. But Scott said a task force could only do so much, and asked Vermonters to work to address racism. To that end, Xusana Davis, Vermont's first Executive Director of Racial Equity, offered a number of suggestions for how white residents could do that — ranging from auditing the media they consume to reaching out to groups that serve people of color. “Take direction from the people that are most deeply impacted,” Davis said. “It’s important that allies not center themselves in the work.” Coronavirus infections continue to decline The state is continuing to see low numbers of new cases, and Scott said as long as that holds, there will be more economic reopenings this week. On Monday, no one was hospitalized due to COVID-19 and the health department only reported two new cases out of more than 1,326 tests. People can now gather in groups up to 25 and close contact businesses, like gyms and spas are allowed to be open at limited capacity. Currently restaurants can only offer outdoor dining, but Scott said that might change soon. “If everything continues to move in the right direction, we’ll include steps to allow for indoor dining at restaurants soon,"" he said. ""And I hope to an update for how we can continue to ramp up our hospitality industry in the weeks ahead."" “Many have noted that the participants were by and large wearing masks, which we applaud. But of course we are concerned about the size of gatherings and lack of social distancing.” ⁠— Health Commissioner Mark Levine The Health Department is still tracking a small “cluster” of cases in Winooski. Health Commissioner Mark Levine said there are now seven cases in that group. Levine said on Friday that the cluster wasn’t associated with an elder care facility or congregate living setting. The health department is now offering testing to all Winooski residents at the O’Brien Community Center. “The testing that we’re providing is really an extension of what we’re doing statewide,"" Levine said. ""But clearly when you found a cluster, it’s best to make it convenient at the moment, and that’s why we’re gearing up there.” Testing in Winooski, and all pop-up sites, is free. Levine also urged people participating in protests to practice physical distancing and other COVID-19 mitigation measures. Levine said large gatherings, like Saturday’s protest in Burlington, could increase the spread of the virus. “Many have noted that the participants were by and large wearing masks, which we applaud,” he said. “But of course we are concerned about the size of gatherings and lack of social distancing.” Driver's license tests to resume The Vermont Department of Motor Vehicles will resume driver’s license testing next week. The exams had been on hold due to the COVID-19 pandemic. DMV Commissioner Wanda Minoli said during the test, the driver and examiner will be required to follow public health guidelines, like wearing cloth masks. “I’m requesting applicants clean and wipe down their vehicle before the exam and leave the windows open where possible to increase the air flow prior to your test. No more than two people may occupy a road vehicle during the exam,” she said. People can now take the learner’s permit test online and if they pass, they’ll get a paper permit in the mail, Minoli said.",0.0

Phil Scott said on Monday that the four Minneapolis police officers involved in the killing of George Floyd should be prosecuted, as he also called for protesters in Vermont to keep the peace, and announced the launch of a racial equity task force to explore policies to combat systemic racism. Hundreds of protesters turned out in Burlington and Montpelier on Saturday as part of nationwide protests and riots sparked by the killing of Floyd. Scott said the anger was justified, and noted that he had joined the Vermont State Police in condemning the police actions. “Mr. Floyd’s death, under their watch, under an officer’s knee, is barbaric and totally inexcusable,” Scott said in remarks at the start of his Monday press conference. “It’s my belief they should all be charged and tried for murder and held fully accountable,” Scott said, “both the three officers who used force (and) the officer who stood by and allowed it to occur. “In the greatest country in the world,” Scott continued, “no one should stand for this. No one should make excuses for this. And no one should ignore this.” The governor noted that many Vermonters are joining in the calls for justice. “And I respect those who are doing so,” he said. “I only ask that you do so peacefully and safely, especially considering the public health crisis we’re facing.” Health Commissioner Mark Levine briefly noted his concern over the size of the protests in Vermont — the governor is increasing the allowable crowd size from 10 to 25 on Monday — while also noting that many participants wore face masks. Vermont’s public safety commissioner, Michael Schirling, said the incident in Minneapolis “looks like something that if it were happening here we would be investigating and referring for prosecution.” He added that such action has no place in Vermont’s police force. “If you’re in this job for any other reason than community service with empathy and to provide a requisite level of protection to those who need it, you should be looking elsewhere,” he said. “We’re past the point where this is something we should be discussing.” Scott was asked about President Donald Trump’s remarks on Monday — after fires burned outside the White House Sunday night — in which he told governors they should “dominate” protesters, adding they would look like “jerks” if rioters were not arrested and jailed “for long periods of time.” “I don’t think the president’s words are reflective of reality,” Scott said. “I believe that we should be leading by example. And, obviously, there are some situations where you have to use more force. But this wasn’t one of them for us here over the weekend.” Asked if he thought Trump should address the nation, Scott said: “Well, maybe not with that attitude.” In New Hampshire, Gov. Chris Sununu, also a Republican, told reporters he is committed to learning from Floyd’s death. “The important conversation — we just want to make sure it does continue, a constructive one, one of positivity. The message does have to be heard, but we’re not going to condone or accept violence by any individuals,” Sununu said. “I’m here to assure the people of New Hampshire that we’re putting in every effort to make sure we’re prepared for whatever scenarios come.” Sununu said he called protesters ahead of a peaceful march in Manchester on Saturday to tell them he supported their message. On Monday, about 60 people gathered at Hampton Beach for another protest, including several officers who joined in by taking a knee. Participants held signs that read “White Silence is Violence” and “We stand with black lives.” Asked to respond to Trump’s comments, Sununu said he is focused more on learning from governors and mayors around the country than on Trump’s comments. “The president’s rhetoric is the president’s rhetoric,” he said. As for Trump’s comments urging local officials to “dominate” the streets, Sununu said, “No, I don’t think anyone needs to be dominated.” “If anything, here in New Hampshire we’ve shown working together in a very constructive and peaceful way is clearly a pathway to be success,” he said. In Massachusetts, Gov. Charlie Baker, also a Republican, reacted strongly to Trump’s comments, saying they were unneeded. “I know I should be surprised when I hear incendiary words like this from him, but I’m not,” Baker said during a news conference on Monday, according to The Boston Globe. “At so many times during these last several weeks, when the country needed compassion and leadership the most, it simply was nowhere to be found. Instead, we got bitterness, combativeness, and self-interest. That’s not what we need in Boston, it’s not what we need right now in Massachusetts, and it’s definitely not what we need across this great country of ours either.” Material from the Associated Press was used in this report.",0.0

Floyd died last week after Minneapolis officer Derek Chauvin kneeled on his neck for more than eight minutes, sparking protests in cities across the country, including Burlington. The resolution also condemned the killings of Breonna Taylor, who was shot by Louisville police and Ahmaud Arbery, who was killed by a white man while jogging in Georgia.  The council approved the resolution in a 10-2 vote, with Councilors Perri Freeman, P-Central District, and Jane Stromberg, P-Ward 8, voting no. The two councilors objected to language that stated the council appreciated the BPD’s behavior during the protest Saturday.  Get Final Reading delivered to your inbox. Sign up free. “We all know in the 21st century, black people in this country continue to live in fear of losing their lives at the hands of law enforcement, or members of the white supremacy groups,” Councilor Ali Dieng, I-Ward 7, said.  Dieng said the resolution, which also condemned racism and discrimination that leads to the deaths of black Americans, was an effort for the council to join other local and state leaders in condemning police brutality.  “We need to make sure, on top of everything, we need justice in this country, and accountability,” he said.  The resolution also stated the council “appreciates the non-confrontational and professional response by the Burlington Police Department” to the protest in Burlington Saturday and “urges the Burlington Police Department to continue to commit to fair and impartial policing policies, continue to develop and implement comprehensive programs to ensure equitable justice policing practices at all levels of the agency.”  Councilor Jane Stromberg, P-Ward 8, proposed an amendment to strike the language about the BPD’s response from the resolution. She said the city should not thank the police for behaving in an appropriate manner.  That amendment failed in a 6-6 vote, along partisan lines, with all of the Progressive councilors voting for Stromberg’s amendment and the Democratic councilors and Dieng voting no.  VTDigger is underwritten by: “I feel like it waters down the ultimate sentiment of this resolution,” Stromberg said. “I don’t think the Burlington Police Department did us any favor by remaining calm, and not responding with force.”  Freeman said she thought the language was completely inappropriate and that the department should not be applauded for doing the bare minimum.  “With the unbelievable anguish this nation is experiencing right now over the unbelievable violence and … brutality that communities have been experiencing, I cannot fathom how this is even remotely appropriate,” she said.  Burlington Mayor Miro Weinberger delivered his state of the city address on a Zoom call in March. During a press briefing Monday, Weinberger condemned the Minneapolis officers and said that he supported calls for further justice and accountability.  “The other officers on the scene did not intervene to stop the lead officer who was applying pressure to George Floyd’s neck … they should be arrested and charged,” he said.  Police Chief Jennifer Morrison said she issued two orders to officers Monday, requiring all personnel to intervene any time they witness misconduct, excessive use of force or any violation of a department rule or policy and stressing that officers should prioritize de-escalation.  Weinberger said he was eager for the city to continue work on recommendations from the special committee on policing. The committee was set up following the release of body camera footage in response to two federal lawsuits in May 2019 showing officers pushing and tackling three black men. A third federal lawsuit alleging police brutality was filed in January.  The committee issued a report recommending revisions to the department’s use of force policy in February. The City Council referred the report to the council’s public safety committee.  Mayor Miro Weinberger, newly nominated Police Chief Jennifer Morrison, and Burlington Acting Police Chief Jon Murad. Photo by Aidan Quigley/VTDigger The special committee was divided, with some members pushing for more substantial change than the committee recommended, particularly regarding the oversight role of the police commission.  Weinberger said the public safety committee’s work stalled when committee meetings were canceled in March due to the coronavirus pandemic. He said he was eager for the committee’s work to continue.  Morrison said she, too, was “ready to roll” with an updated use of force policy.  “I’m feeling a sense of urgency, I want that updated policy to go into effect,” she said.  The council discussed the three ongoing use of force lawsuits behind closed doors in an executive session around midnight Monday.  During his briefing, Weinberger said there were no significant milestones to report in the progress of the lawsuits, and the council was seeking to understand the city’s legal strategy.  VTDigger is underwritten by: Evan Chadwick, who represents the men suing the department, declined to comment on the ongoing lawsuits, which are currently in the discovery stage.  During the protest Saturday, demonstrators criticized the department’s disproportionate use of force on black residents, and what they argue is the lack of appropriate officer discipline for excessive use of force.  Burlington Police Sgt. Jason Bellavance, shown in body camera footage shoving Jeremie Meli against a wall on Sept. 9, 2019, received a less-than-three-week suspension. Officers who drank beer confiscated from teenagers in December 2018 received a three-week suspension.  Randall Harp of the Committee to Review Policing Policies speaks as the commission hears a report on the Burlington Police Department’s use of force policies on Oct. 29, 2019. Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDigger Weinberger said that Bellavance was disciplined in accordance with city procedures in consultation with the citizen police commission.  “The discipline that was meted out there was very significant discipline relative to past incidents, and it was supported strongly, I don’t remember if it was unanimous, but the commission felt like it was an appropriate step,” he said. “At this point, over 18 months since the incident took place, to go back and try to second guess the decisions that were made at the time, is not something I am prepared to do.”  Morrison said the incident was “well behind us,” and the discipline Bellavance faced was “unprecedented” in her lengthy tenure at the department.  “There was generally sort of a line in the sand that any suspension beyond two weeks was really just punishing the family economically,” she said. “The issue is that you want to correct behaviors, you don’t want to punish families.”  Morrison pushed back on a VTDigger question asking if Bellavance’s punishment reflected the officer accountability that Weinberger is calling for in Minneapolis.  “You’re trying to conflate a shove of a person who had been reported to have been in a fight, to the incident in Minneapolis, and they’re just not the same,” she said. “I think, candidly, that we’re not doing ourselves any favor when we keep conflating these things.”  She said it was time to move forward.  “It’s time for us to start growing from these incidents, instead of turning around and looking at them any time an excessive force case somewhere in the country comes up,” she said.

He also sympathized with demonstrators around the country, saying their outage was ""justifiable.""""My heart goes out to all people of color across the nation who, even though they live in different communities, carry this trauma every time something like this happens,"" Scott said in his first public remarks following a weekend of civil unrest in response to Floyd's death.Floyd, a 46-year-old black man, died May 25 after a white police officer, Derek Chauvin, pinned him face down on pavement and knelt on his neck for more than eight minutes. Video of the encounter shows Floyd pleading for his life.""I can't breathe,"" he said.Four officers have been fired, and Chauvin has been charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter.Scott and Vermont State Police leaders condemned the act in a statement last week. The governor doubled down on Monday, using the opening remarks of his press briefing to call for murder charges to be filed against every officer involved in the ""barbaric and totally inexcusable"" killing.""Both the three officers who used force, and the officers who stood by and allowed it to occur,"" Scott said. ""In the greatest country in the world, no one should stand for this. No one should make excuses for this. And no one should ignore this. We must all make clear: Enough is enough.""Protests erupted in more than 100 American cities over the weekend. In Burlington, hundreds gathered in Battery Park on Saturday before marching to the nearby police department. There, an activist with a megaphone grilled the city's police brass about past allegations of officer misconduct before emtying a jug of red liquid at their feet.""Their blood is on your hands,"" said Harmony Edosomwan, the protest's leader, referring to people killed by cops.Scott said he remained in close contact with the city's mayor and state police throughout the weekend and was pleased to see the ""tense"" demonstration end peacefully.""Obviously, there were a lot of people, for Vermont, in one location,"" Scott said. ""But I think everyone conducted themselves well on both sides.""Violence has broken out in other cities, and more than half of the nation's governors have called in the National Guard. On a private call with governors Monday morning, President Donald Trump described the protesters as ""terrorists"" and urged governors to start arresting them, according to the New York Times. ""You have to dominate,"" the president told governors on the private call, which occurred at the same time as Scott's briefing. ""If you don't dominate, you're wasting your time — they're going to run over you, you're going to look like a bunch of jerks.""After a reporter summarized the message, Scott said he believed the president's ""unfortunate choice of words"" are not ""reflected by reality.""Scott said he would only call in the Guard if a protest overwhelmed local law enforcement and put public safety at risk. Activating the Guard ""creates a lot of unrest,"" Scott said, and may ""provoke more violence.""Earlier in the briefing, Scott asked observers of the clashes to keep in mind a message from Martin Luther King Jr. ""A riot is the language of the unheard,"" Scott said, quoting the civil rights icon. ""They simply don't know what else to do.'""""For those who see the national protests and feel disdain instead of sympathy, just know the reactions we're seeing in cities around the country are the results of decades — actually centuries — of calls for help that went unheard,"" the Republican governor said.Scott said Vermont is not exempt from the systemic racism built into the nation's social and economic systems. To that end, he said he was forming a racial equity task force in Vermont that will begin by looking at death rate disparities between white and nonwhite COVID-19 victims.The task force will also evaluate how well the state supports its racially diverse population, review hate speech laws and encourage nonwhite Vermonters to seek public office, Scott said. He expected to announce appointments to the body next week.As demonstrations continued in some cities on Monday, Scott asked Vermonters who plan to gather again to remain peaceful and keep in mind the ongoing COVID-19 health crisis. Though many protesters in Burlington wore masks, the sheer mass of the crowd made it impossible for many to adhere to social distancing guidelines, Health Commissioner Mark Levine noted.Still, Scott fell short of asking Vermonters to avoid demonstrations altogether, and seemed to signal that he has no intention of trying to enforce the part of his executive order that currently bans gatherings of more than 25 people.""The fact is, hate, ignorance and the inequality we've seen is a far greater risk to the long-term health of our nation than even COVID-19,"" he said.He ended his remarks by striking an optimistic tone.""The good news is, we can fix this without waiting for a vaccine or other solutions out of our control,"" Scott said.

Hundreds demonstrated outside the Burlington Police Department on Saturday. ""Our students should know that it is OK to feel outrage,"" Obeng said. ""It is OK to feel anger and a sense of helplessness because the adults around you have failed to do the right things to enable you to inherit a society where people feel safe and respected.""But considering these emotions, it is not OK to riot. It is not OK to loot. But it is OK to stand up, protest, speak out and develop a plan for change,"" he continued. Obeng, who is black, is one of a few people of color in Vermont in an executive-level government position, and the first black superintendent in Burlington. He will step down later this month after announcing his resignation last fall.Some prominent public officials and law enforcement leaders in Vermont have condemned Floyd's killing and expressed support for prosecuting the four Minneapolis officers involved in his arrest. Gov. Phil Scott said he was forming a racial equity task force that would examine aspects of systemic racism.""Black people and people of color are feeling great pain in this moment because it is a reminder of the lack of progress, and the inequities that still exist,"" Obeng said in the video.The superintendent challenged students, parents and school officials to work together as ""allies"" and ""problem solvers.""""I call on our non-colored students and families to stand beside people of color.I call on parents to have these crucial conversations with their children.

White students make up 60 percent of high schoolers, but made up 80 percent of students in honors classes during the 2018-2019 academic year.Less than 4 percent of Burlington's licensed teachers are people of color.

But the debate leading up to the vote took nearly an hour because some councilors disagreed with including a thank you to city cops for their work during peaceful protests over the weekend. click to enlarge File: James Buck The demonstrators Saturday marched to police headquarters Also on Monday, interim police Chief Jennifer Morrison responded to the Floyd case by fast-tracking two changes to departmental policy that a special committee on policing proposed in February.  In a memo, Morrison announced that officers must intervene any time they witness misconduct or excessive force by a fellow officer, and that they must prioritize deescalation whenever feasible.  Both changes were expected to be included in a forthcoming revision to the department's use-of-force policy, but Morrison said she decided to implement them immediately to show community members that the department took their concerns seriously.  ""Right now, the community needs to know that we are doing everything possible to prevent anything like what we saw in Minneapolis from happening here,"" she said during a briefing with the mayor. The resolution, which ultimately passed 10 to 2, also asks Burlington Mayor Miro Weinberger to fly the Black Lives Matter flag at City Hall ""for the remainder of the COVID-19 State of Emergency.""""The struggle is real, and the time is now to take action,"" said City Councilor Ali Dieng (I-Ward 7), who is black and introduced the resolution.The measure came two days after hundreds flocked to Burlington's Battery Park to protest the death of George Floyd, a black man who was killed when a white police officer knelt on Floyd's neck for several minutes. The officer, Derek Chauvin, was fired and has been charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter; three other officers were also terminated.Councilors Perri Freeman (P-Central District) and Jane Stromberg (P-Ward 8) cast the no votes because the resolution includes a line thanking Burlington police for their ""non-confrontational and professional response"" during Saturday's demonstration. ""It waters down the ultimate sentiment of this resolution,"" Stromberg said. ""This is not a moment for us to reflect on our systems of what they're doing right. This was exactly the opposite of that.""Freeman spoke passionately and in a raised voice of feeling ""horrified and completely livid"" that the language was included.""With the unbelievable anguish that this nation is experiencing right now over the unbelievable violence and the brutality that communities have been experiencing, I cannot fathom how this is even remotely appropriate,"" Freeman said.Councilor Zoraya Hightower (P-Ward 1), who is black, called the wording ""problematic."" Councilor Jack Hanson (P-East District), who attended the demonstration, said the language detracts from the protesters' message. He said there would be other opportunities to thank the police for their professionalism.Including the line in the resolution ""totally undermines who we're trying to highlight and who's being brutalized and who we need to uplift and focus on in this moment,"" Hanson said.Hanson also noted that Burlingtonians have suffered at the hands of police. In the fall of 2018, Sgt. Jason Bellavance and Officer Joseph Corrow knocked two black men unconscious in separate incidents downtown. And last spring, Officer Cory Campbell punched Douglas Kilburn, a white man, in a scuffle outside the University of Vermont Medical Center. Kilburn died days later, and the medical examiner ruled that the officer's punches contributed to the man's death. Bellavance was suspended for three weeks without pay, but Corrow was not disciplined. Campbell was reprimanded for using foul language.Activists had demanded more than a year ago that all three officers be fired. A change.org petition started then has recently picked up thousands more signatures in the days following Floyd's death. Some 33,000 supporters have now signed the petition.Stromberg ultimately proposed an amendment to remove the line thanking the police department from the resolution. Councilor Brian Pine (P-Ward 3) said he initially supported Dieng's version — and signed on as a cosponsor — but said that his fellow Progressive councilors had swayed his vote, and he supported the amendment.Councilor Joan Shannon (D-South District) supported Dieng's wording because ""I don't know how we move forward if we don't recognize the good work that's being done."" Councilor Sarah Carpenter (D-Ward 4) suggested that that council should be ""adding appreciation as opposed to taking it away.""Stromberg's amendment eventually failed in a 6-6 tie, and the council ultimately went on to pass the original version.Earlier in the meeting, councilors debated a separate, wide-ranging resolution that aims to create a more ""just economy"" in Burlington. Introduced by Freeman , the resolution sought to give councilors the ability to write ordinances to protect renters from evictions, tax the wealthiest Burlingtonians and set a minimum wage for Queen City workers, among other progressive policies.The measure asks the council's Charter Change Committee to vet the proposals for inclusion on future city ballots. Dieng moved to postpone the vote until the council's June 15 meeting; the motion passed 10 to 2, with councilors Shannon and Chip Mason (D-Ward 5) voting no.Freeman reluctantly agreed to postpone the discussion, chiding her fellow councilors because she thought she had support to move the resolution on to committee. The measures would need to be approved by voters and the Vermont legislature before becoming law.""I woke up this morning with pretty much enough votes to refer it ... and I came into the meeting realizing that I don't think those votes were there,"" Freeman said. ""It's just a funny way that the council can work sometimes.""A dozen people Zoomed into the meeting to express concern about the resolution. Hill Section resident Karen Allen said Freeman's proposal to levy a luxury tax on property sales exceeding $500,000 had ""horrific"" timing and was ""unwarranted.""Ward 4 residents T.J. Jemison and Sean Kelly said they'd consider leaving Burlington if the council enacted a tax on people who make at least $125,000 a year. Local landlord Donald Slish decried a provision that would protect tenants from no-cause evictions.""I'm not a rich guy because I make more than $125,000 a year,"" he said. ""I know you have a bleeding heart to people without money, but please, spare a little bit of sympathy for people who are working hard to maintain these buildings.""Fellow councilors, too, charged that Freeman hadn't done enough research and complained that they only had had a few days to consider the resolution.Shannon said a minimum wage ordinance would push businesses outside city limits. ""We have so many businesses that are teetering on the brink of a cliff because of COVID,"" she said. ""And it looks like we want to push them over the cliff rather than help them back.""Mason, commenting on a for-cause termination clause, said he was wary of involving the city in employee-employer relationships. He said it was ""crazy"" to propose raising taxes as the city prepares for a reappraisal and before taxpayers feel the full brunt of the Burlington School District school renovation bond Hanson, however, said the time is right to consider the resolution because the pandemic ""has just laid bare the grotesque inequality in our society.""""I'm glad to see us start to get the ball rolling on being able to take some bolder steps as a community,"" he said.",0.0

The fence was put up overnight to block access to Lafayette Park, just across the street from the White House. ""Last night pushed me way over the edge,"" said Jessica DeMaio, 40, of Washington, who attended a Floyd protest Tuesday for the first time. ""Being here is better than being at home feeling helpless."" The crowd remained in place after the city's 7 p.m. curfew passed, defying warnings that the response from law enforcement could be even more forceful. But the protest lacked the tension of the previous nights' demonstrations. The crowd Tuesday was peaceful, even polite. At one point, the crowd booed when a protester climbed a light post and took down a street sign. A chant went up: ""Peaceful protest!"" On Monday, law enforcement officers on foot and horseback aggressively drove protesters away from Lafayette Park, clearing the way for President Donald Trump to do a photo op at nearby St. John's Church. On Tuesday, pastors at the church prayed with demonstrators and handed out water bottles. Protests ranged across the U.S., including in Los Angeles, Miami, St. Paul, Minnesota, Columbia, South Carolina, and Houston, where the police chief talked to peaceful demonstrators, vowing reforms. ""God as my witness, change is coming,"" Art Acevedo said. ""And we're going to do it the right way."" In New York, midtown Manhattan was pocked with battered storefronts after Monday's protests. Macy's flagship store was among those hit when crowds of people smashed windows and looted stores as they swept through the area. Police made nearly 700 arrests and Mayor Bill de Blasio extended an 8 p.m. curfew all week. ""We're going to have a tough few days,"" he warned, but added: ""We're going to beat it back."" He pleaded with community leaders to step forward and ""create peace."" Thousands of protesters marched Tuesday night in a string of demonstrations across Manhattan and Brooklyn after merchants boarded up their businesses, fearing a repeat of the night before. Many people remained on the streets after the curfew hour. Police eventually ordered them to move along and began taking some into custody. More than 20,000 National Guard members have been called up in 29 states to deal with the violence. New York is not among them, and de Blasio has said he does not want the Guard. On Tuesday, Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo called what happened in the city ""a disgrace."" ""The NYPD and the mayor did not do their job last night,"" Cuomo said at a briefing in Albany. He said the mayor underestimated the problem, and the nation's largest police force was not deployed in sufficient numbers, though the city had said it doubled the usual police presence. Tuesday marked the eighth straight night of the protests, which began in Minneapolis, where Floyd died, and quickly spread across the country. The mother of George Floyd's 6-year-old daughter, Gianna, said she wanted the world to know that her little girl lost a good father. ""I want everybody to know that this is what those officers took,"" Roxie Washington said during a Minneapolis news conference with her young daughter at her side. ""I want justice for him because he was good. No matter what anybody thinks, he was good."" On Monday, scattered violence flared in multiple protests, including an officer who was shot and gravely wounded outside a Las Vegas hotel and casino, and four officers shot in St. Louis. They were expected to recover. About a dozen other deaths have been reported around the country over the past week. And nearly 8,000 people nationwide have been arrested, according to a count by The Associated Press. Some protesters framed the burgeoning movement as a necessity after a string of killings by police. ""It feels like it's just been an endless cascade of hashtags of black people dying, and it feels like nothing's really being done by our political leaders to actually enact real change,"" said Christine Ohenzuwa, 19, who attended a peaceful protest at the Minnesota state Capitol in St. Paul. ""There's always going to be a breaking point. I think right now, we're seeing the breaking point around the country."" ""I live in this state. It's really painful to see what's going on, but it's also really important to understand that it's connected to a system of racial violence,"" she said. Meanwhile, governors and mayors, Republicans and Democrats alike, rejected Trump's threat to send in the military, with some saying troops would be unnecessary and others questioning whether the government has such authority and warning that such a step would be dangerous. ""Denver is not Little Rock in 1957, and Donald Trump is not President Eisenhower. This is a time for healing, for bringing people together, and the best way to protect civil rights is to move away from escalating violence,"" Colorado Gov. Jared Polis and Denver Mayor Michael Hancock, both Democrats, said in a statement, referring to Eisenhower's use of troops to enforce school desegregation in the South. A senior White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that the president is not rushing to send in the military and that his goal was to pressure governors to deploy more National Guard members. Such use of the military would mark a stunning federal intervention rarely seen in modern American history. Amid the protests, nine states and the District of Columbia held presidential primaries that tested the nation's ability to run elections while balancing a pandemic and sweeping social unrest. Joe Biden won hundreds more delegates and was on the cusp of formally securing the Democratic presidential nomination. Also Tuesday, Minnesota opened an investigation into whether the Minneapolis Police Department has a pattern of discrimination against minorities. Floyd died May 25 after a white Minneapolis officer, Derek Chauvin, pressed his knee on the handcuffed black man's neck for several minutes. Chauvin has been charged with murder. Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said prosecutors are working as fast as they can to determine if the three other officers at the scene should be charged too. All four have been fired. ___ Sullivan reported from Minneapolis. Associated Press journalists across the U.S. contributed to this report. Copyright 2020 Associated Press. All rights reserved.",0.0

Scott: Why we're launching a racial equity task force Posted Monday, June 1, 2020 12:42 pm Editor's note: The governor released this statement after his thrice-weekly press conference to update Vermonters on the state's response to the coronavirus. I wanted to start my briefing today by addressing the tragic death of George Floyd in Minnesota, the reactions, and justifiable outrage it's sparked across the nation. I also want to remind everyone of the role each of us has to play in making our nation better, and truly equitable, for every American, regardless of their skin color, religion, sexuality, job, where they were born, or their political views. Mr. Floyd's death is a heartbreaking tragedy and a painful reminder that if you believe, as do I, that everyone is created equal in the eyes of God and according to the founding principles of our nation, we have much more work to do, to be a better country and better people. My heart goes out to his family and the Minneapolis community, which is suffering deeply right now. Further, my heart goes out to all people of color across the nation, who, even if they live in different cities, carry this trauma every time something like this happens. As you know, last week I joined the Vermont State Police to condemn the actions of the officers involved. Mr. Floyd's death, under their watch, under an officer's knee, is barbaric and totally inexcusable. It's my belief they should all be charged and tried for murder, and held fully accountable, both the three officers who used force, and the officer who stood by and allowed it to occur. In the greatest country in the world, no one should stand for this, no one should make excuses for this, and no one should ignore this. We must ALL make clear: enough is enough. Article Continues After Advertisement And while we're watching the response across the country, it's important to reflect on a quote from Dr. Martin Luther King, who said, ""A riot is the language of the unheard."" They simply don't know what else to do. For those who see the national protests and feel disdain, instead of sympathy, just know, the reactions we're seeing in cities around the country are the result of decades — actually centuries — of calls for help that went unheard. For many people today, every time something like this happens, it's another reminder of how long communities of color have been waiting for equity, and how little things have changed. It's clear the fear, sadness, helplessness and frustration has reached a boiling point, as the African American community has seen FAR too much of this and many Americans are standing with them, as we should, because again, enough is enough. Article Continues After These Ads I know many Vermonters are seeking to have their voices heard as well and I respect those who are doing so. My only ask is you do so peacefully and safely, especially considering the public health crisis we're facing. But I assure you, we're listening. I hear what you have to say and I know we not only need to continue to hear it, but also act. The fact is, hate, ignorance and the inequality we see is a far greater risk to the long term health of our nation than even COVID-19. That's why we cannot continue to treat racism, and examples like the one in Minneapolis, like an uncomfortable and rare event. Because it's not an isolated incident and we need to acknowledge it's systemic — it's built into our social systems, our economic systems and everything in between. We must also remember we're not immune to this in Vermont, which is why we've been working on a Racial Equity Task Force in recent months, and it will be launched today. Article Continues After Advertisement This task force will be charged with looking at the disparities in COVID-19 infection and death rates, so we can figure out how to close that gap. They'll also evaluate what supports we have for racially diverse populations and whether it's enough. It will review current state and federal law on hate speech and contemplate ways to encourage Vermonters from a range of racial and ethnic groups to run and serve in public office, at all levels. And we'll have updates next week when the appointments are made and as this work gets moving. But let's be honest, a taskforce is not the cure all for what ails us. It's going to take some soul searching, and real change, individually, to make a difference. We should take this time to reflect on what role each of us can play to end hate, racism and bigotry. And for those of us who are white, who aren't typically the victim of it, we need to take a very close look because the reality is, it's everywhere, even here. The good news is, we can fix this without waiting for a vaccine, or other solutions out of our control, it just takes us uniting, to make this a better country for everyone, because like the coronavirus, this is literally in our hands.

1623263588,2020-06-01 21:43:42,White House deploys troops to clear path for Trump before church photo-op,https://www.mychamplainvalley.com/news/politics/tear-gas-threats-before-trump-visits-church-amid-protests/,en,True,"politics and government, united states politics and government, demonstrations and riots",228215,mychamplainvalley.com,http://mychamplainvalley.com/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — It began with Attorney General Bill Barr standing with his hands casually in his pockets, not wearing a tie, surveying the scene at Lafayette Park across from the White House, where several thousand protesters had gathered for more demonstrations after the police killing of George Floyd. President Donald Trump had announced he would soon be addressing the nation from the White House Rose Garden, as a 7 p.m. curfew in the city loomed and a mass of law enforcement, including U.S. Secret Service agents, Park Police and National Guardsmen, stood sentry, many dressed in riot gear. Barr: Law enforcement must ‘dominate’ streets amid protests Moments before 6:30 p.m., just when Trump said he would begin his address, the officers suddenly marched forward, directly confronting the protesters as many held up their hands, saying, “Don’t shoot.” Soon, law enforcement officers were aggressively forcing the protesters back, firing tear gas and deploying flash bangs into the crowd to disperse them from the park for seemingly no reason. It was a jarring scene as police in the nation’s capital forcefully cleared young men and women gathered legally in a public park on a sunny evening, all of it on live television. With smoke still wafting and isolated tussles continuing in the crowd, Trump emerged in the Rose Garden for a dramatic split-screen of his own creation. Trump as thug or hero? Depends on what network you watch “I am your president of law and order and an ally of all peaceful protesters,” he declared, before demanding that governors across the nation deploy the National Guard “in sufficient numbers that we dominate the streets.” And he warned that, if they refused, he would deploy the United States military “and quickly solve the problem for them.” As an additional show of force, Trump announced he was deploying even more of the military to Washington, D.C., giving it the feel of an armed, locked-down city after days of violent clashes, arson and looting. “As we speak I am dispatching thousands and thousands of heavily armed soldiers,” he said, as explosions rang out in the background. “We are putting everybody on warning.” Then, before departing, Trump announced he wasn’t done for the evening, and would be “going to pay my respects to a very very special place.” Moments later, the White House press pool was quickly summoned for a surprise movement. And soon after, Trump strolled out of the White House gates — something he had never done before — and walked across the park that had just been cleared to accommodate his movements. Barr: Law enforcement must ‘dominate’ streets amid protests Trump walked slowly, followed by an entourage of his most senior aides, security and reporters. The faint residue of pepper spray hung in the air, stinging eyes and prompting coughing. Sections of the park and surrounding sidewalks were strewn with garbage, including plastic water bottles and other debris. Some sections had been scrawled with graffiti. Trump crossed H Street and walked toward St. John’s Church, the landmark pale yellow building where every president, including Trump, has prayed. It had been damaged Sunday night in a protest fire. Trump, standing alone in front of cameras, then raised a black-covered Bible for reporters to see. “We have a great country,” Trump said. “Greatest country in the world.” He didn’t talk about Floyd, the church or the damage it had suffered, or the peaceful protesters police had cleared. He said nothing about the coronavirus pandemic, the parallel crisis that has continued to ravage the nation as Trump campaigns for a second presidential term. And then he invited his attorney general, national security adviser, chief of staff, press secretary and defense secretary — all white — to join him for another round of photos before he walked back across the park to the White House. At one point, he stopped and pumped his fist in the air at National Guard members in the distance. “We’re going to keep it nice and safe,” he said. DC Episcopal bishop: ‘I am outraged’ by Trump church visit Rabbi Jack Moline, the president of Interfaith Alliance, slammed the fact that peaceful protesters near the White House were gassed and shot with rubber bullets so Trump could hold his photo op. “Seeing President Trump stand in front of St. John’s Episcopal Church while holding a Bible in response to calls for racial justice — right after using military force to clear peaceful protesters out of the area — is one of the most flagrant misuses of religion I have ever seen,” Moline said in a statement. “This only underscores the president’s complete lack of compassion for Black Americans and the lethal consequences of racism.” And the Right Rev. Mariann Budde, bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Washington, to which St. John’s belongs, said she was “outraged” by the moment and noted that Trump didn’t pray during his visit. “He took the symbols sacred to our tradition and stood in front of a house of prayer in full expectation that would be a celebratory moment,” Budde told The Associated Press. “There was nothing I could do but speak out against that.”",0.0

Mayor Bill de Blasio announced the plan Tuesday after a night when chaos broke out in midtown Manhattan and the Bronx. On Monday, an 11 p.m. curfew failed to prevent destruction as groups of people smashed their way into shops. It was the city’s first curfew in decades. Meanwhile, Gov. Andrew Cuomo at a separate briefing denounced de Blasio and the New York City Police as ineffective in the face of the nightly looting. The governor said he offered help from the National Guard, an option de Blasio opposes. New York City contact tracers hired to contain the spread of the coronavirus are on the job. Tracers reached out to all of the roughly 600 people who tested positive for the virus citywide on Monday, the first day of the program. Also, Gov. Cuomo says summer days camps in New York can open June 29, though no decision has been made yet on sleep-away camps. The green light on summer camps comes as the state continues to make slow progress taming the outbreak. The daily death toll has been under 60 for several days, with 58 new deaths recorded Monday. Police say a state trooper run over by an SUV that barreled through a group of officers at a George Floyd demonstration in Buffalo broke his leg and shattered his pelvis. Another trooper and a Buffalo police officer were treated for minor injuries after being struck by the Ford Explorer after it broke through a blockade at about 10 p.m. Monday. The driver and a passenger had been shot and were hospitalized with non-life threatening injuries. (Copyright 2020 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

VMS President, Catherine Schneider, M.D. and VMS President-Elect, Simha Ravven, M.D., state, “The VMS stands with the Vermont State Police, the American Medical Association (AMA), the American Psychiatric Association (APA) and the American Academy of Pediatrics in Vermont (AAPVT) in denouncing not only police brutality against Black people, but in recognizing that racism and violence against people of color is unacceptable, unwarranted and a detriment to our country. The continued discrimination against people of color has deep lasting health impacts, as well as divisive social impacts. We cannot have a healthy nation if we continue to marginalize and harm any sector of our population.” There are harmful health impacts of structural racism and racism in law enforcement. The AMA’s May 29 statement condemning police brutality notes: “Research demonstrates that racially marginalized communities are disproportionally subject to police force… An increased prevalence of police encounters is linked to elevated stress and anxiety levels, along with increased rates of high blood pressure, diabetes and asthma—and fatal complications of those comorbid conditions.” The Vermont Medical Society supports the Vermont State Police in condemning police brutality in the death of George Floyd and their commitment to fair and impartial policing, de-escalation, and relationship building in communities of color. “The civil unrest taking place in America is a call to action to all Americans to address the longstanding racial inequalities facing the Black community,” said APA CEO and Medical Director Saul Levin, M.D. “Centuries of systemic and institutional racism toward Black Americans has led to decreased access to health care and multiple adverse health outcomes—as recently seen during the COVID-19 pandemic—in addition to anxiety and lower life-expectancy”. Dr. Rebecca Bell, M.D., President of the American Academy of Pediatrics Vermont Chapter said, “Racism is a public health issue and a social determinant of health that creates toxic stress and impacts health. Children will not be able to reach their full potential until we prevent and counteract these experiences for all children--in medicine and everyday life. The AAPVT Chapter condemns violence, especially when perpetrated by authorities, and calls for a deep examination of how to improve the role of policing. Systemic violence requires systemic response.” We are watching these tragic events unfold during the COVID-19 global health pandemic, where in Vermont and across the nation, incidence of more severe illness is disproportionately impacting certain racial and ethnic populations and exposing the uneven access to care that leads to disparities in health outcomes. The VMS is committed to addressing bias in health care, as evidenced by our policy from 2018, in which we resolve to support systems designed to combat biases within the health care system and to work to mitigate the unequal treatment of patients and health care professionals. The VMS grieves for the families of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor, and countless others, where race was a determining factor in their interaction with law enforcement and ultimately their untimely deaths. Systemic racism not only destroys the social cohesion of our nation, it also produces devasting health impacts born from trauma, chronic stress and differential access to health care. We as a State and a nation must do better for the health of all. About the Vermont Medical Society: The Vermont Medical Society is the leading voice of physicians in the state and is dedicated to advancing the practice of medicine by advocating on behalf of Vermont’s physicians, physician assistants and the patients and communities they care for.

The 29-year-old officer in Las Vegas was shot as police tried to disperse a large crowd of protesters in front of a casino shuttered because of the coronavirus. At about the same time and less than three miles (4.8 kilometers) away, police outside a federal courthouse shot a protester who was wearing a black tactical vest and armed with two handguns and a rifle. Police said the man was shot as he reached for a firearm. In other violence around the country, four officers were shot and wounded in Missouri and others in New York were hurt when a car plowed into a line of police. ""With these protests, which are leading to riots, one tragedy is only leading to another,"" said Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo, who heads the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department. The incidents came amid chaotic scenes that followed peaceful protests over the killing of Floyd, police brutality and racism. A number of cities have seen heavy-handed riot tactics by police and clashes between officers and demonstrators. On Monday night, as protests started to dwindle in St. Louis, four officers standing in a line were shot and injured when someone opened fire. All four were expected to recover. In the same city several hours later, police said four officers in a marked police car were fired on by men in a car. Police in Buffalo, New York, said an SUV broke through a police blockade at a protest and ran over a state trooper, breaking his leg and shattering his pelvis. Another trooper and a Buffalo police officer were also hit by the vehicle and treated for minor injuries. In Madison, Wisconsin, police Chief Vic Wahl said police officers were struck with rocks and projectiles. Over the weekend, police in Los Angeles reported rocks and other objects rained down on police at a demonstration near an outdoor mall, leaving one officer with a fractured skull. In Oakland, California, violence Friday night left 13 officers injured and a federal officer was fatally shot from an unidentified vehicle while providing security at a courthouse during a protest. Dave Patrick Underwood, 53, died and another officer was critically wounded, authorities said. Lombardo said officers in Las Vegas were being hit by rocks and bottles when a shot rang out and the officer, Shay Kellin Mikalonis, went down on the casino-lined Las Vegas Strip. Police said Mikalonis, a Las Vegas police officer for four years, was shot from across the street and 20-year-old Edgar Samaniego of Las Vegas was identified by video before he was later arrested on suspicion of the shooting. Jail and court records showed Samaniego was being held pending an initial court appearance on attempted murder and weapon charges. An attorney who represented Samaniego in a personal injury lawsuit in 2016 declined to comment, saying he was not immediately representing him on the criminal charges. Deputy Police Chief Chris Jones told reporters the man killed by police near the courthouse, 25-year-old Jorge Gomez of Las Vegas, had one of his three handguns mounted in what Jones called a ""carbine conversion kit"" that officials say made it resemble a rifle. Gomez remained near the courthouse after police ordered what the deputy chief called ""rowdy"" demonstrators to disperse, and was hit several times with beanbag projectiles before he was shot as he raised a gun toward officers who were helping an officer on the ground, Jones said. Lombardo and local officials pleaded multiple times in recent days for events to remain peaceful. They have so far resisted calls to impose a curfew in Las Vegas. Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak said Tuesday he was praying for the ""officer who was senselessly shot"" and ""all of the communities across Nevada who are experiencing grief and pain."" ""It's during these trying times we must remind ourselves that creating a state where justice and peace exist together in partnership, not as a binary choice, is the goal we must all work toward,"" he said. Sisolak said he was activating ""additional"" members of the Nevada National Guard to support state and local law enforcement at the protests. He initially deployed the Guard over the weekend. The governor's office said the Guard units would not be making arrests or doing crowd control but would ""focus on protecting critical facilities, preserving public safety, and allowing individuals to exercise their rights to peacefully demonstrate."" Monday's protest began near President Donald Trump's non-casino hotel, Trump International Tower, just off the Las Vegas Strip and remained peaceful for more than four hours. ""All night long, everybody worked hard to keep everybody safe,"" said U.S. Marshal Gary Schofield, head of the local federal security agency involved with police in the shooting in front of the courthouse. ""Unfortunately, criminals hijacked the event."" ___ Associated Press writer Paul Davenport in Phoenix and photojournalist John Locher in Las Vegas contributed to this report.

Many cities imposed curfews, and President Trump again warned he would order active duty military forces to restore order if state and local governments, in his judgement, failed to do so. Here are details of some protests around the country. St. Louis Four police officers were shot and wounded during another night of unrest in St. Louis, according to the city's police chief, John Hayden. In an emotional news conference, Hayden said the officers were hurt in an incident downtown following a day of peaceful protests that drew thousands into the city's streets. He said a couple hundred people ""with no intention of protesting or doing anything constructive"" remained late into the night, looting, vandalizing and throwing objects at police officers. Just after midnight, shots were fired at a line of officers, striking two in the leg, one in the foot and another in the arm, he said. Hayden said none of the injuries were life-threatening. Hayden called Floyd's death tragic but said what was happening in St. Louis was ""mayhem."" ""They're throwing fireworks on officers, fireworks were exploding on officers,"" he said. ""They had officers that had gas poured on them. And you try to figure out what is going on. How can this be?"" Las Vegas There were a pair of shootings overnight in Las Vegas, one of which left a police officer hospitalized and ""in grave condition,"" according to Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Sheriff Joseph Lombardo. The first incident took place in front of the famed Circus Circus Hotel and Casino as police said they were working to disperse protesters. Lombardo said rocks and bottles were being hurled at police. ""Officers were attempting to get some of the protesters in custody when a shot rang out and our officer went down,"" he said during an early Tuesday morning press briefing. The unnamed officer was transported to a local hospital and is in critical condition, he said. A suspect is in custody. The other incident took place shortly before midnight on Monday, when LVMPD and federal officers were guarding the Foley Federal Building and U.S. courthouse. Lombardo said police encountered a man ""who was armed with multiple firearms and appeared to be wearing body armor."" Then, ""officers engaged him"" and ""the suspect was struck by gunfire,"" Lombardo said. He was later pronounced dead. It is unclear if the man was taking part in the protests prior to his deadly encounter with police. Investigations into both incidents are ongoing. ""With these protests, which are leading to riots, one tragedy is only leading to another,"" Lombardo said. ""What has occurred is utterly unacceptable. I hope the community sees it that way too."" Omaha, Neb. Protesters gathered in downtown Omaha on Monday for the third consecutive night after Douglas County Attorney Donald Kleine ruled that a white bar owner who shot and killed a 22-year-old black Omaha protester on Saturday acted in self-defense. Protesters carried signs with slogans such as ""Hands up — don't shoot"" and chanted ""Black lives matter,"" according to Megan Feeney, a freelance journalist reporting for NPR member station NET in Omaha. ""A lot of black leaders were saying, 'Don't go downtown tonight, we need to reconsider our approach, think about how we can reorganize and want to avoid any useless violence, pain and potential death,' "" Feeney said. After the start of an 8 p.m. curfew, the protest had shrunk considerably, according to Feeney, and military vehicles blocked streets adjacent to the demonstration. ""Police started to advance and people started running. They ran down an alley, got blocked and some in the crowd started to throw water bottles and other objects while others yelled to stop,"" Feeney said. ""Officers started closing in from all four directions and nobody could leave."" The Omaha Police Department reported two firearms arrests as well as an unspecified number of arrests for curfew violations. New York New York City imposed an 11 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew Monday. Mayor Bill de Blasio announced the curfew would begin Tuesday at 8 p.m. Protests were largely peaceful, though some looting was reported at a few luxury retailers, including Macy's flagship store in Manhattan. In Buffalo, a city police officer and New York state trooper were struck by an SUV during a protest. The law enforcement officers were not seriously injured. It was unclear whether the driver intentionally struck the officers. ~~~~~https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Freecereports%2Fstatus%2F1267629669093978117https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2FAliWatkins%2Fstatus%2F1267654230183227393https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fnyspolice%2Fstatus%2F1267655485278339072~~~~~~ Los Angeles In Los Angeles, where some 700 people were arrested on Sunday, there was a heavy police presence in Hollywood and Van Nuys amid multiple protests, mostly peaceful.

The Alameda County Sheriff's office tweeted late Monday, ""Over 100 people arrested so far. It is time to go home."" In nearby Walnut Creek, several hundred protesters, mostly teenagers and young people, walked onto Interstate 680, according to the East Bay Times. Police in riot gear ordered them to disperse before chasing them with dogs, firing tear gas and rubber bullets, the newspaper said.

Not everyone is on board, considering it insufficient in addressing systemic racism. #BlackOutTuesday originated in the music industry to suspend business in the wake of national unrest due to the death of George Floyd. A white police officer in Minneapolis pressed his knee into the neck of Floyd, who was African American, for more than eight minutes while Floyd indicated he could not breathe. His death spurred protests across the nation calling out police brutality against black Americans. Another response to Floyd's death is online activity on social media, including the #BlackOutTuesday hashtag. Vermont businesses and organizations posted black tiles on their feed with varying messages echoing support. Examples include: In addition to businesses, individuals are hashtagging photos of black tiles on their personal accounts. Why some are taking issue with #BlackOutTuesday A rundown of the hashtag's shortcomings were explored in USA TODAY's For The Win section Tuesday morning. One issue involves people writing #BlackLivesMatter, ""normally used as a tool for protestors to communicate information through social media."" This can make it difficult for those seeking information on actions beyond #BlackOutTuesday. Another issue revolves around the overall effectiveness of the hashtag: ""There are arguments that now, more than ever, is when communication shouldn’t be 'blacked out,'"" the post read. Vermonter Candace Taylor used her Instagram account to address the hashtag, noting she is black and refuses to be silent. In the caption, she told people to keep their ""performative hashtags and tactics."" Buy Photo The ""Protest for George Floyd!"" filled Battery Park, and then during a march spilled onto North Avenue and the parking lot at the Burlington Police Department.

1623546807,2020-06-02 14:20:40,PAI: ‘A riot is the language of the unheard’,https://vermontbiz.com/news/2020/june/02/pai-%E2%80%98-riot-language-unheard%E2%80%99,en,False,"politics and government, medicine and health, blacks, diseases and conditions, demonstrations and riots, economic conditions and trends",96620,vermontbiz.com,http://www.vermontbiz.com/#spider,"by Paul Cillo, Public Assets Institute The national unrest of the last week has added a layer of pain to what many Vermonters were already experiencing during the pandemic: economic hardship, inequitable access to public resources and health care, and the stress of being isolated from family and friends. The killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis and the protests that have followed over the past week, including in Burlington and Montpelier, have forced us to reckon with the reality that our state does not work for every resident, particularly for Black Vermonters. This is not the Vermont we want. Our state is 94 percent white. But Black Vermonters experience poverty at twice the rate of the rest of the state, despite being more likely to work. And as the efforts by many to collect and disseminate policing statistics across the state have made clear, Black Vermonters are much more likely to be stopped by police, to be searched, and to be incarcerated. And Black Vermonters have a higher rate of COVID-19 than any other group. None of this is an accident. And none of this is new. This is the result of centuries of policies intended to enslave, target, and exclude Black Americans to protect the power of the white majority, and it is embedded in Vermont’s economic, education, and justice systems. We applaud Gov. Phil Scott for acknowledging Vermont’s systemic racism at his press conference yesterday and the ongoing challenge of dismantling it. Dismantling systemic racism is urgent. It demands that each of us act now: listen, learn, protest, ask questions of elected officials and each other. There are opportunities to be part of community conversations in Vermont. Panel and Organizing for Racial Justice in Vermont will be held online tonight at 6:00. Hidden in Plain Sight: The Truth About Systemic Racism, a webinar open to anyone, will be held this Thursday at 6:00 PM. It was notable that at his press conference the governor cited the words of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.: “A riot is the language of the unheard.” Here’s more of what Dr. King said at Stanford University on April 14, 1967: “I think America must see that riots do not develop out of thin air. Certain conditions continue to exist in our society which must be condemned as vigorously as we condemn riots. But in the final analysis, a riot is the language of the unheard. And what is it that America has failed to hear? It has failed to hear that the plight of the Negro poor has worsened over the last few years. It has failed to hear that the promises of freedom and justice have not been met. And it has failed to hear that large segments of white society are more concerned about tranquility and the status quo than about justice, equality, and humanity. And so in a real sense our nation’s summers of riots are caused by our nation’s winters of delay. And as long as America postpones justice, we stand in the position of having these recurrences of violence and riots over and over again. Social justice and progress are the absolute guarantors of riot prevention.”",0.0

It's our nation's Original Sin, committed when Europeans stole the land and its resources from its original inhabitants and bought and sold African men and women as slaves to build this country and create wealth for themselves. Our foundational documents declare that ""all men are created equal,"" but the authors failed to confront the obvious hypocrisy of asserting the right to freedom while denying it to others. Despite a Civil War over slavery and the fleeting triumphs of the civil rights movement, this country has been largely unwilling or unable to take a long, hard look in the mirror and confront its own racism. It is time to do so, and time to declare that Black Lives Matter. In our state of Vermont, where whites are 93 percent of the population and African-Americans are just 1 percent according to 2018 Census data, white homogeneity obscures racism and biases, lulling the majority into thinking that it's not their problem. But racism does exist here. This national crisis reminds us that our community is not immune, and that we must do better. This remains a state where, according to a 2017 University of Vermont study, people of color are more likely to be pulled over in their cars by a police officer. It's a state where, according to a 2018 study, African-Americans make up 1 percent of the population, but 8.5 percent of Vermont's prisoners. It's a state where the only African-American woman in the Vermont Legislature, former state Rep. Kiah Morris of Bennington, stepped down after enduring racial harassment, and where state Attorney General T.J. Donovan acknowledged that harassment, but said he could not charge her tormentors under the law — a decision with which many strongly disagree. So we cannot look away from our perch in the Green Mountains as people in Minneapolis and across the country stand up to protest the killing of George Floyd at the hands of a white Minneapolis police officer. White Vermonters must listen to what their African-American neighbors are saying, and then act to combat racism and injustice here. Article Continues After Advertisement The pain felt in Minneapolis has spread, and it has gotten worse. White anarchists have infiltrated peaceful protests and caused widespread destruction, seemingly hoping to touch off violent revolutions or discredit legitimate peaceful protest. Alarmingly, some rogue police in cities across the country have targeted peaceful protesters and reporters with tear gas and rubber bullets. It's getting out of hand, and it's scary. In contrast, in communities throughout Southern Vermont this past weekend, people came together in peace to protest — with the support of law enforcement. The Vermont State Police and police departments in Bennington, Brattleboro, Manchester and Winhall all released strong statements mourning the death of George Floyd and condemning the brutality that led to it. Their awareness is much appreciated. Article Continues After These Ads But what is true in America is also true in Vermont: People of color here know, from their own experiences and the experiences of friends and family, that they are not always treated fairly, by law enforcement or society. They live with social alienation and the implied threat of personal danger every day. Most of us have no idea how that feels. It's time we listen and learn. Gov. Phil Scott added his voice to condemnation of Floyd's death on Monday. ""No one should stand for this. No one should make excuses for this. And no one should ignore this,"" Scott said, calling for prosecution of all four now-former officers involved. He also announced the creation of a racial equity task force which will address the racial disparity in COVID-19 infection and death rates, as well as several other assignments. Here are more actions that should be taken: Article Continues After Advertisement - Vermont House Bill H.808, patterned after a new California law, would establish new requirements for police use of deadly force. At a committee hearing on the bill in January, Donovan and Public Safety Commissioner Michael Schirling both suggested the Legislature slow down and study how California's law plays out. It's time to speed things up. The bill is before the House Government Operations committee; its chair is Rep. Sarah Copeland Hanzas, D-Bradford, and local members include Rep. Nelson Brownell of Pownal and Rep. Mike Mrowicki of Putney. - Vermont House Bill H.478 would establish a task force to investigate the possibility of reparations for slavery. Vermont outlawed adult slavery in its 1777 constitution, but that didn't stop slavery from happening here. A thorough and honest accounting is overdue. That bill is also before the Government Operations committee. - Act 54 of 2017 directed the Attorney General's office, with the state Human Rights Commission and interested stakeholders, to develop a strategy to address racial disparities within the state systems of education, labor and employment, access to housing and health care and economic development. These efforts should be priorities. - It's also clear that across the country, civilians, under whose authority police are sworn and authorized to use force to uphold the law, should have a stronger say over that authority. Bennington is currently considering such a commission, and Brattleboro has a Citizen Police Communications Committee. Perhaps every Vermont city or town with a police force should have one. The systematic mistreatment of African-Americans over 400 years is a national burden, not a local issue confined to ""sunset towns"" and the Jim Crow South. Martin Luther King Jr., in his ""Letter from a Birmingham Jail,"" said it better than anyone else: ""Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny. Whatever affects one directly, affects all indirectly.""",0.0
1623620186,2020-06-02 15:52:41,Rep. Peter Welch On The Killing Of George Floyd,https://www.vpr.org/post/rep-peter-welch-killing-george-floyd,en,False,"politics and government, united states politics and government, police, demonstrations and riots, murders and attempted murders",76749,digital.vpr.net,http://digital.vpr.net/#spider,"Over the weekend, there were major protests in many American cities, including at a number of locations in Vermont. Many more demonstrators joined in across the world to protest the death of George Floyd, an African American man who was killed on May 25 in Minneapolis. Floyd died in police custody, after a law enforcement officer knelt on his neck for over eight minutes, despite pleas from Floyd that he couldn't breathe. That police officer has been charged with third degree murder and second degree manslaughter, but protesters want the other three officers who were present at the scene to be charged as well. Some of the protests have turned violent amid concerns that small groups of agitators are trying to turn largely peaceful protests into a larger political statement. Our guest is: Peter Welch, Democratic U.S. Representative from Vermont Broadcast live after Gov. Phil Scott's 11:00 a.m. press conference on June 1, 2020; rebroadcast at 7:00 p.m. The following has been edited and condensed for clarity. Bob Kinzel: Congressman, as you watch the video of protests from around the country all weekend, what ran through your mind? Rep. Peter Welch: I could never get out of my mind that searing image of the Minneapolis police officer with his knee on the neck of Mr. Floyd, who was prone, lying face down into the pavement and pleading for his breath and his life. Part of what was so shocking to me was that the officer who was doing it was so casually indifferent to what he was doing and how Mr. Floyd was suffering and about to die. The officer had his hands in his pockets. It was no big deal for him, and he was doing this in front of people who were videotaping him. He was displaying that he thought he was entitled to do it. And, he was doing it in front of three colleagues. The sacred trust of our police officers is to keep us safe. And they sat by, stood by and watched this entire event unfold for eight long minutes and then 43 endless seconds. It was just shocking. ""I think what everybody saw with that video is just how ingrained some of this conduct is in the culture in some places."" Vermont Rep. @PeterWelch responds to the killing of George Floyd: pic.twitter.com/Hy1mx8Udg5 — Vermont Edition (@vermontedition) June 1, 2020 Do you think those other officers should be charged as well? I do. They have a duty – all officers do – to stop a crime from being committed. And that crime went on. I mean, there was a point where this is way past any kind of subduing a suspect. There was no threat whatsoever. So those other police officers can't just turn a blind eye to what was a wanton act by the officer who had the knee on Mr. Floyd's neck. How do you think this is being viewed around the world? I think it's viewed right now from the perspective of what happened to Mr. Floyd. But it's also being exposed in the context of ripping this bandage off of what has been the historic stain of slavery in our country. These actions on the street are taking place right after what happened in Minnesota. But if we just look back, there was the killing of Mr. Arbery, who was a jogger. He was jogging in a neighborhood, and a father and son killed him because they were thinking they were, quote, “stopping a crime” – the crime of jogging while black. More from VPR: Talking With New American Youth About Racism And then you had, of course, the Central Park person, that woman who confronted an African-American man who was birdwatching. He was birdwatching. And she got on the phone and called the police demanding they come because she was, quote, “under attack.” ""There is something very deep here that I think all of us have to acknowledge is our responsibility to examine and finally face."" - Rep. Peter Welch This is not just an issue that's related to the police. It's immensely important with the police because they have the authority of the law and the authority of the state. But this is something that you saw with the Central Park woman. You saw with those two men, the father and son in Georgia, that there's something very deep here that I think all of us have to acknowledge is our responsibility to examine and finally to face. There have been several thousand national cases of African-Americans being killed by police officers in the last decade. You mentioned some of the higher profile cases. After every case, there is a message that things have to change. And yet very little seems to change, and it's just a matter of time before we have another tragedy. Why is this time different? We don't know if it's different, but it's necessary. And you're right: It goes on and on. You know, last spring when we could still travel, my wife and I took a trip to Mississippi and went to where ­young Emmett Till from Chicago was slaughtered because supposedly he said, ""Hello,"" in effect, to a white woman in a store. This violence has been going on. And I've talked to some of the really good people I respect in law enforcement, and they think things have been sliding a little bit backwards. Each of us has an individual responsibility to do our level best out in government. We have to have policies that make it possible for there to be equal opportunity. And that has not happened. There's been an incredible disproportionate impact of death and illness from the coronavirus on black Americans and brown Americans. And there are a lot of reasons for that – but they're not genetic. More from VPR: Vermont’s Deputy Health Commissioner On COVID-19 Data Collection, Demographic Trends It's really a function of many things that we've allowed to occur in our society over time. In my view, each and every one of us has to do whatever it is we can to start to correct it. ""We've got to ban the chokehold."" - Rep. Peter Welch In an official statement on the death of George Floyd, you wrote: “The police officers involved must be prosecuted to the full extent of the law. But each of us shares the responsibility to challenge a society where it is, normal for a black man jogging to be shot or a black man bird watching to be accused of a life threatening attack or our justice system to be too often indifferent to justice. We must all renew our commitment to all we can to build a society as free of bigotry and equality."" So how do you see yourself and your colleagues in the House renewing your commitment to this effort? Just to give a couple of examples: We do need criminal justice reform. I mean, we have mass incarceration in this country. It's heavily focused on people of color. And one of the things that we also have to do is have a justice system and a Justice Department that investigates cases involving the death of people in the custody of officials. More from VPR: Why Are There So Many African-Americans Incarcerated In Vermont? We've got to do that. We've got to ban the chokehold. I mean, that's essentially the version of it that was used to kill Eric Garner and it was in a version of it used here. Hakeem Jeffries, one of my colleagues, has a bill on that. I'll be on it. Proud to cosponsor the Eric Garner Excessive Use of Force Prevention Act that would prohibit police chokeholds like the one that killed George Floyd. https://t.co/K32RkFsCKY — Rep. Peter Welch (@PeterWelch) June 2, 2020 Rep. Ayanna Pressley has a resolution that I’m on with her to require the Justice Department to be investigating killings in police custody. I also think that on the CARES Act, when we were trying to get money to small businesses, we put in a provision that said these local community banks have to be given access to that money, not just the JP Morgans, because they're much more in a position to help folks who live in minority communities. It has to be on the front of our mind. It's about trying to make certain that the talk about equal opportunity has a mechanism by which folks who want to lift themselves up have a shot to do it.

Clearly, this was a lie.”  The Vermont bishop also took issue with Trump’s use of a Bible.  “The words of our Bible are the lifeblood of our prayers,” she said. “They teach us about peace, love and justice, and sustain us when we need hope. The words of the Bible connect us to the life and teachings of Jesus. Through him we have learned to love our neighbor and build beloved community.”  The Episcopal Church in Vermont, the state’s fourth largest religious denomination with 5,700 members in 47 congregations, has offered daily online prayer this week to mourn the deaths of more than 100,000 Americans from Covid-19 and of George Floyd and other blacks killed by police.  “The circumstances of the pandemic and the current unrest have brought this nation to a place where we can no longer deny the brokenness of a society that is built on the subjugation and oppression of many while a few control most of the economic wealth,” MacVean-Brown said in her letter.  “The church must call out this systemic callousness and disregard for the dignity of human beings,” the Vermont bishop continued. “We must realize that striving for justice and peace will make us uncomfortable and challenge many to give up their privilege.”  VTDigger is underwritten by: MacVean-Brown asked Episcopalians to pray for the people of St. John’s and the nation “that we would be healed from the viruses of racism and Covid-19.”  The full letter, titled “Reaffirming Our Renunciation of Evil,” is posted on the Episcopal Diocese of Vermont website.  MacVean-Brown is just one of many religious leaders to speak out about the incident.  “This was done in a time of deep hurt and pain in our country,” the Episcopal Church’s Presiding Bishop Michael Curry said in a statement, “and his action did nothing to help us or to heal us.” Share Email 2K Shares Stay on top of all of Vermont's criminal justice news.

Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDigger Backers of a bill that would change the standard for when police are justified in using deadly force in Vermont say they are hopeful the legislation will be propelled by the officer-involved killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis and the outrage it has sparked.  Hundreds of people took part in protests in Burlington and around the state over the weekend as other protests and riots went on across the country over racial disparities in police violence.  However, Rep. Anne Donahue, R-Northfield, the lead sponsor of H.808, doesn’t believe that the renewed focus on the issue will mobilize Vermont’s lawmakers to pass the legislation this session, at least not as introduced.  Get all of VTDigger's daily news. You'll never miss a story with our daily headlines in your inbox. “I do think this will potentially raise the profile of this enough to say, ‘We do have to get something moving in this regard this year,’” Donahue said Monday of her proposed legislation, which was the focus of a hearing that drew a large crowd earlier this year. The bill remains in the House Government Operations Committee.  The state’s response to the coronavirus and budget issues have taken up much of the Legislature’s time over the past two months. Police violence has been among many policy issues pushed to the back.  Protesters in Vermont and across the country have taken to the streets over the past week in response to the killing last Monday of 46-year-old Floyd, a black man, as a white Minneapolis police officer kneeled on Floyd’s neck for over eight minutes.  [Related: Why do deaths at the hands of police keep rising in Vermont?] Rep. Kevin “Coach” Christie, D-White River Junction and chair of the Vermont Human Rights Commission, is also a sponsor of H.808. He said while he was aware that lawmakers need to spend time on Covid-19 matters and the related budget issues, he hoped that the measure, as well as others — such as improving data collection throughout the criminal justice system to help track racial disparities — would advance as well.  VTDigger is underwritten by: “The pieces of legislation around systemic racism and addressing those issues will probably rise, we would hope so,” he said Monday. “If they don’t, that’s not a good thing.”  Many law enforcement agencies around Vermont, including the Burlington Police Department and Vermont State Police, issued statements condemning Floyd’s killing. James Lyall, executive director of the Vermont chapter of American Civil Liberties Union, said those “same voices” have often stood in the way of police reforms in the state, including H.808.  “H-808 is just one example, one of the more recent examples,” Lyall said, adding that legislation aimed at addressing racial disparities and police violence have often been met with similar opposition.  “Any time there is a criminal justice reform bill, or certainly any time there is a police reform bill,” Lyall said, “there is a lot of testimony from police, and a lot of deference to police, and not as much to other voices.”  Rep. Anne Donahue, R-Northfield, speaks on the floor of the House at the Statehouse on May 14, 2019. Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDigger H.808 in Vermont is modeled after legislation approved in California last year changing that state’s legal standard for deadly force by a law enforcement officer.  Under that California legislation, which is considered the toughest standard for police use of force in the country, law enforcement in that state can only use deadly force when “necessary,” or when no other options exist.  Donahue said Monday that she didn’t expect when she introduced the legislation that it would sail to approval as is.  “It was never my expectation that the first year introducing a bill that would completely change the standard for police use of force would pass,” she said. “But it would be very much my hope that we would start in motion a process of evaluating that change.”  She added, “In legislative speak that means some kind of a working committee that would put the time and the energy needed to evaluate how it could be reapplied in Vermont.”  Gov. Phil Scott, in response to questions about the legislation during a press conference Monday, said he didn’t know much about the details of the bill.  “We are evolving as we speak and we want to take this time to reflect on what we’re doing, do it better,” he said. “I’m just not aware of the bill in particular and where it stands at this point in time.”  Michael Schirling, Vermont’s public safety commissioner, testified earlier this year on the legislation. The commissioner said at that time it was too soon to adopt a measure similar to California’s, without first seeing how it plays out in that state.  “Let’s hold fast and see what happens in California, because they have completely broken the glass on 50 years of case law relative to this topic, and we don’t know what’s going to happen,” Schirling told lawmakers. “So let’s see.”  On Monday, Schirling said that remains his view of the legislation.  VTDigger is underwritten by: Attorney General TJ Donovan said Monday that he supports moving to the California standard, though he believed there were some pieces of the current legislation that needed further discussion. For example, in Vermont the current standard involves what a “reasonable person” would do, versus the term “reasonable officer” in the proposed legislation. That language difference, he said, is something that needs to be discussed to understand all the ramifications.  Vermont Attorney General TJ Donovan, speaking before a joint legislative committee. Photo by Mike Dougherty/VTDigger “I would certainly support engaging with the Legislature on this bill,” he said, adding, “Let’s engage in the process, let’s come out with a bill that changes the standard.”  A VTDigger analysis shows there were 17 fatal police encounters over the past decade. According to Vermont State Police statistics, there were five trooper-involved shootings in the state in 2019. That was one more than the previous year. There was one shooting involving a Vermont State Police trooper in 2017 and none in 2016.  Those statistics only take into account shootings involving state police, Vermont’s largest law enforcement agency, which provides the information on its website. Once investigations were completed, the troopers’ actions in all of them were deemed justified by the Vermont Attorney General’s Office and the county state’s attorney’s offices.  H.808 would establish a statewide policy, unlike the legal standard that is applied now in Vermont based on case law. That Vermont standard relies in large part on whether a reasonable person would have acted in the same manner.  According to the bill, law enforcement officers may use deadly force only when necessary in defense of human life.  “In determining whether deadly force is necessary,” the legislation stated, “officers shall evaluate each situation in light of the particular circumstances of each case and shall use other available resources and techniques if reasonably safe and feasible to an objectively reasonable officer.”  Share Email 276 Shares Stay on top of all of Vermont's criminal justice news.

Protests and riots have engulfed the nation since his death on May 25, one police officer has been arrested. Scott called on the other three officers to be charged and said, “enough is enough.” Scott then announced that he had formed a Racial Equity Task Force, chaired by the Executive Director of Racial Equity Xusana Davis. He also quoted Dr Martin Luther King Jr from a speech at Stanford in 1967: “A riot is the language of the unheard.” Scott said he was proud of the peaceful way Vermonters have handled the situation, but acknowledged the underlying racism, “We are not immune to this in Vermont.” The governor’s thrice-weekly media briefings began in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the resultant emergency declaration and subsequent mitigation orders. The first orders closed nursing homes and schools and then many other areas of the economy. Other businesses were directed to work-from-home. Only designated essential workers and businesses were allowed to continue, albeit under health guidance. As the economy has reopened over the last month, there are still businesses somewhat or mostly closed. The governor hopes to announce restricted reopening of indoor restaurant service as soon as Friday. Meanwhile gatherings are limited to 25 people, with continued health guidance (facial coverings, physical distancing, washing hands, etc), and inside business operations are limited to 25 percent capacity or 25, whichever is greater. Big box stores, for instance, are generally large enough that they typically do not reach 25 percent capacity, but they have been counting customers. However, events that require by their nature large crowds, like county fairs and the Quechee balloon festival, have all been canceled for this summer. The good news Scott was able to deliver on Monday was the resumption of drivers examinations and permit tests. The permit tests are available online. The drivers exams will include use of driving instructors, who must be qualified to administer a road test. This is intended to reduce the backlog of about 1,000 people seeking a drivers license. They will be administered on a first-come basis with those with already scheduled and canceled exams going first. Road tests are expected to restart June 8. The current health guidance applies and drivers are not permitted to enter the DMV office. This does not include CDL or motorcycle exams. Dr Mark Levine again presented at the press briefing an update on the health side of the COVID-19 pandemic in Vermont. He reiterated again that the data in Vermont is very positive with very few new cases in the state. He said a “cluster” of seven cases in Winooski was being investigated and traced and was not linked to a single institution. A free testing pop-up site has been established for everyone at the O’Brien Community Center in Winooski. As of Tuesday, there are no recent deaths, which stand at 55, there are none hospitalized and the total cases statewide is 988 – an increase of five since Monday. Overall, more than 1,000 tests are administered daily in Vermont. REPORTER Q&A MONDAY Governor Scott was asked about the racial tensions, President Trump’s response and what is happening in Vermont. During the press briefing the president was holding a conference call with governor’s and called them “weak” for not dealing with protesters and the riots with greater force. Scott wasn’t of course on that call as he held his own briefing, but further indicated that Trump’s words were “unfortunate.” Scott said of racism and the resultant problems, “We didn’t get here overnight and we’re not going to fix it overnight” Xusana Davis said no one wants to be labeled. She said -- offering some levity -- she was not only a person of color, but a lawyer and a millennial so she had to deal with plenty of labels. In response to a question about white supremacy, she said that “white privilege” does not mean a white person’s life isn’t hard. It means that their life isn’t hard simply because of the color of their skin. Davis spoke about neutral complacency. Silence only adds to the problem. When asked what a white person can do, she offered a long list, but finished it with the statement: “Do something.” Health Commissioner Mark Levine, MD, was asked about the link between people of color and COVID-19. He said the sample size is small in Vermont, but nationally, the infection rate among African Americans is twice as great than for whites and they represent 33 percent of deaths, even though they are only 13 percent of the population. Scott was asked about policing in Vermont and a bill in the Legislature on the use of deadly force, he said he did not know the status of that bill but that his administration has been working over the years on how the police deal with the community and with confrontational situations. Scott said he has tremendous respect for law enforcement. Davis said everyone must respect the law and added that policing is a dangerous job. She said, however, that laws are applied differently to different people, which has been an ongoing problem, both on the street and in sentencing. Public Safety Commissioner Michael Schirling, who also oversees the State Police, said policing starts with hiring. He said the first measure of someone applying to be a police officer is whether they understand that the job is all about public service. If you’re not interested in that “look elsewhere,” Schirling said. Out-of-Staters While overnight summer camps for kids, including for out-of-state campers, will be allowed to resume under guidance, lodging is still only available to in-state guests or those who have quarantined in Vermont for 14 days (or 7 days if they’ve been tested). Governor Scott suggested he will relax some of those rules, perhaps as early as this week, under conditions. When asked about the plethora of out-of-state license plates coming into Vermont, he acknowledged that it appeared from border counts of plates that more are coming in than going out. College students also are coming back as their rental leases in the Burlington area generally begin June 1. He said he has no plans of using more stringent methods to keep those from out-of-state away because, as been seen in other states, confrontation has led to worse outcomes than mere education and guidance. Scott said, however, that he remains very concerned by the COVID-19 case counts in the surrounding region. Modeling presented last Friday showed that there have been 60,000 deaths within in five-hour drive of Vermont and nearly 200,000 cases. And even though counts in places like New York City and Boston have been going down, there are still thousands of new infections weekly. He and Health Commissioner Levine both indicated their concern that the protests here and everywhere could lead to more infections as large crowds gather and physical distancing is nearly impossible. Childcare Centers Crucial to restarting the economy is the availability of childcare. Human Services Secretary Mike Smith reiterated that the state has poured millions of dollars into the system to keep the system afloat during the pandemic. There is also $6 million available to help them cover new expenses, like for cleaning and PPE. The Education Agency is working on a plan with school districts on how to bring schools safely back online to in-person education this fall. There is no guidance yet in that regard. Scott was asked whether the current circumstances had created an opportunity to make landmark changes in the education system. Specifically he was asked about perhaps rolling childcare into the public education system, which would allow for better pay, benefits and stability. He said he continues to advocate for a ""cradle to college"" system. The caveat there is that Scott does not want to spend more than we are spending now on pre-K through college. He has frequently said that we are spending more now than ever while educating fewer and fewer students as the population ages. He said he believes there is plenty of money in the system for such a landmark change. Mail-In Voting Governor Scott was again asked about mail-in voting. Again he gave the same, somewhat perplexed answer. The Senate today passed a bill that would remove the governor from the decision-making on mail-in voting and give it solely to Secretary of State Jim Condos. The issue involves whether the state should mail everyone a general election ballot. This differs from an absentee ballot that anyone can get in that everyone on the voter rolls would receive the ballot regardless. This is all in case there is no in-person voting in November because of the COVID-19 crisis. The primary ballots all will be mailed. Scott’s position has been referred to as the “opt-in” option, in which the state waits until after the primary to decide on whether it appears necessary to mail the ballots. They can’t be mailed before that because the general election candidates will not be known until after the primary in August. Condos had taken an “opt-out” view of the process, in which the decision is made now to mail out the ballots, and if there was an “all clear” later in the summer than in-person elections could be held. Condos said town clerks, and everyone else, needs to know how they will have to proceed for planning purposes. Scott also wanted an unelected committee to decide whether to opt-in or opt-out when the time came, so two officials (Scott and Condos) who were on the ballots would not be the ones deciding. But the Legislature, which gave the authority to Scott and Condos at the beginning of the crisis, did not give it to a committee. Scott has basically punted on the process and said that he will go along with Condos’ plan. Scott has said the process has been politicized and doesn’t understand the confusion in his position. But, again, that is not what the Legislature intended. It appears that the Legislature will remove the governor from this process and Condos will make the decision to move forward with mail-in balloting. The Legislature also could just decide to move forward with mail-in balloting and remove Condos also, but this seems unlikely. But the Senate voted 21-7 today in favor of S348, granting full authority to the Secretary of State. On another political note, Scott was asked about debates and if not in-person, what about a Zoom or Skype debate? He said the COVID-19 crisis and resulting economic fallout is taking all of his time. He said the state of emergency is not keeping him from debating. He could not give a timeline of when he could get back to campaigning and he’s not waiting until we’re back to normal, but he has to be confident that the state is back on the path to recovery.",0.0
1623713038,2020-06-02 00:23:06,Community gathers at vigil for George Floyd’s death,https://middleburycampus.com/51388/local/community-gathers-for-vigil-for-george-floyds-death/,en,False,"police, demonstrations and riots",122750,middleburycampus.com,http://middleburycampus.com/,"As thousands around the world protested this weekend against the killing of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer, the town of Middlebury joined in a collective vigil for Floyd’s life. Roughly 375 people congregated — while maintaining social distance and wearing masks — on and around College Park and the Cross Street Bridge on Saturday to remember Floyd and to protest the act of police brutality that ended his life. The Middlebury chapter of Showing Up For Racial Justice (SURJ) and the Champlain Valley Unitarian Universalist Society (CVUUS) organized the vigil. Due to Middlebury’s rural location and the threats presented by the Covid-19 outbreak, organizers were careful to consider the risk of Covid-19 spread in setting up the event. Organizers planned the event to occur in tandem with a protest held in Burlington, and participants were asked to limit chanting and yelling during the demonstration in order to combat the transmission of the novel coronavirus. “We were all wearing masks and standing far apart. There was something powerful to me about that. Normally rallies and protests have some element of socializing to them, as we greet friends and neighbors we haven’t seen in a while,” Professor Pam Berenbaum, director of Middlebury’s global health program, said in an email to The Campus. “This time, it felt quieter and more somber, as people were aware of the risks of attending a public event during Covid-19 and kept the greetings to a minimum. As a result, the issue we were protesting, racial injustice, seemed to come into sharper relief.” Joanna Colwell, media and outreach coordinator for SURJ Middlebury, sees a connection between Covid-19 prevention measures and the vigil itself. “Both embody a sort of caring for your community,” Colwell said. “Wearing a mask is a way to say that I care about your safety.” The result was a somber and reflective demonstration, a far cry from the violence and rioting that has beset many American cities in the last week. Participants remained on the sidewalk and there was no visible Middlebury Police Department presence. This too was a contrast from similar demonstrations around the country, where protesters marching in streets faced widespread police brutality. In Middlebury, the demonstration remained calm. Participants held signs of the names of unarmed black men and women who had been killed by police around the country. Families used the opportunity to teach their young about the harsh realities of the country, said Economics Professor Jon Isham. Isham was at first taken aback by the vigil’s non-traditional form, a result of the organizers’ Covid-19 prevention efforts. “It was very respectful and very somber,” he said. “Everyone was looking for what to do, looking down the road, looking for an answer.” Echoing a sentiment shared by President Patton in her statement on Floyd’s killing, Isham pointed to the consciousness of Covid-19 transmission as illustrating the country’s battle against what he described as two pandemics, the virus and racism. Yet, organizers acknowledged that in order for the demonstration to be truly meaningful, work must continue through the summer and beyond. Throughout the demonstration, SURJ handed out flyers with information on resources and actions to continue anti-racist work after the event, including links to bail funds and petitions. “Our vigil nourished my faith that Addison County is well situated to be a bright light in the struggle to dismantle racism,” said Reverend Barnaby Feder, minister of CVUUS. “But it didn’t undermine the systems and attitudes that make events like the murder of George Floyd inevitable. That is the real work still to be done.” Colwell was even blunter, referencing Addison County’s overwhelmingly white population. “As white people in a racist society, we think it’s ‘those bad racist people’ over there, but that is untrue. We need to make sure that people continue to do the work after the moment passes.” The town and college have not escaped incidents of police discrimination and brutality in the past, with Middlebury Public Safety’s history of racial profiling allegations and Vermont’s rise in deaths at the hands of police anchoring the issues in Addison County. Colwell and Feder had originally planned for around 100 participants to arrive on Saturday. They were happily surprised when close to 400 protesters showed up. For Colwell, the purpose of both the vigil and its Covid-19 prevention measures boil down to a simple sentiment: “everyone deserves to be safe.”",0.0

Having lived through the Ferguson riots in St. Louis six years ago, I know that protests like this are also driven by built-up frustrations, frustrations that can easily boil over into civil unrest. When peaceful protests turn into rioting and looting, everyone is hurt, and the message of change is distorted. Again, there is no value to the destruction of property. This is unacceptable. Those frustrations may have started with the senseless killing of George Floyd, but I suspect they may have as much to do with the challenges brought on by the current pandemic. Frustration over what to believe, when to reopen, and what lies ahead. At times like this, I am reminded of that memorable spiritual from the civil rights movement of the 1960s, “We shall overcome.” We will get through this, hopefully, more engaged, more motivated, more determined to expect better. I know that many in our Champlain College family and the Burlington community are hurting. To all of you, I offer my sincere hope that tomorrow will be better, that we will find a path forward. Please know that we at Champlain College are available to assist you in every way. The challenges we face at this moment may seem overwhelming, but experience tells us we shall overcome them. It will take time, cooperation, common sense, and consideration for one another. Let’s come together in a spirit of kindness and fellowship. This is the time to reflect and to lead from where you are to do all that is possible to ensure that this senseless act does not repeat itself, ever, in our respective communities. I recall in one of the last installments of Star Wars, the wife of Yoda’s father put in perspective the challenges that America must confront: “We need to do and to stop trying.” America, it’s time to stop trying and to focus our collective efforts on what it takes to stop this senseless killing of people of color.

Not everyone is on board, considering it insufficient in addressing systemic racism. #BlackOutTuesday originated in the music industry to suspend business in the wake of national unrest due to the death of George Floyd. A white police officer in Minneapolis pressed his knee into the neck of Floyd, who was African American, for more than eight minutes while Floyd indicated he could not breathe. His death spurred protests across the nation calling out police brutality against black Americans. Another response to Floyd's death is online activity on social media, including the #BlackOutTuesday hashtag. Vermont businesses and organizations posted black tiles on their feed with varying messages echoing support. Examples include: In addition to businesses, individuals are hashtagging photos of black tiles on their personal accounts. Why some are taking issue with #BlackOutTuesday A rundown of the hashtag's shortcomings were explored in USA TODAY's For The Win section Tuesday morning. One issue involves people writing #BlackLivesMatter, ""normally used as a tool for protestors to communicate information through social media."" This can make it difficult for those seeking information on actions beyond #BlackOutTuesday. Another issue revolves around the overall effectiveness of the hashtag: ""There are arguments that now, more than ever, is when communication shouldn’t be 'blacked out,'"" the post read. Vermonter Candace Taylor used her Instagram account to address the hashtag, noting she is black and refuses to be silent. In the caption, she told people to keep their ""performative hashtags and tactics."" Buy Photo The ""Protest for George Floyd!"" filled Battery Park, and then during a march spilled onto North Avenue and the parking lot at the Burlington Police Department.

Provided photo Vermont’s first black Episcopal bishop has denounced the use of force against peaceful protesters so President Donald Trump could pose for photos with a Bible outside the denomination’s church in Washington, D.C.  “Using precious objects of our faith as props in a display to uphold white dominance and violence is a blatant display of evil,” Bishop Shannon MacVean-Brown said Tuesday in an open letter.  Authorities fired tear gas, flash-bang shells and rubber bullets Monday night to disperse demonstrators between the White House and St. John’s Episcopal Church, where leaders weren’t alerted of the Trump photo op.  Get all of VTDigger's daily news. You'll never miss a story with our daily headlines in your inbox. “The president used military force to violently disperse peacefully gathered people, including our siblings of the Diocese of Washington,” MacVean-Brown said in her letter. “Just moments before, the president said he supports peaceful demonstrators. Clearly, this was a lie.”  The Vermont bishop also took issue with Trump’s use of a Bible.  “The words of our Bible are the lifeblood of our prayers,” she said. “They teach us about peace, love and justice, and sustain us when we need hope. The words of the Bible connect us to the life and teachings of Jesus. Through him we have learned to love our neighbor and build beloved community.”  The Episcopal Church in Vermont, the state’s fourth largest religious denomination with 5,700 members in 47 congregations, has offered daily online prayer this week to mourn the deaths of more than 100,000 Americans from Covid-19 and of George Floyd and other blacks killed by police.  “The circumstances of the pandemic and the current unrest have brought this nation to a place where we can no longer deny the brokenness of a society that is built on the subjugation and oppression of many while a few control most of the economic wealth,” MacVean-Brown said in her letter.  “The church must call out this systemic callousness and disregard for the dignity of human beings,” the Vermont bishop continued. “We must realize that striving for justice and peace will make us uncomfortable and challenge many to give up their privilege.”  VTDigger is underwritten by: MacVean-Brown asked Episcopalians to pray for the people of St. John’s and the nation “that we would be healed from the viruses of racism and Covid-19.”  The full letter, titled “Reaffirming Our Renunciation of Evil,” is posted on the Episcopal Diocese of Vermont website.  MacVean-Brown is just one of many religious leaders to speak out about the incident.  “This was done in a time of deep hurt and pain in our country,” the Episcopal Church’s Presiding Bishop Michael Curry said in a statement, “and his action did nothing to help us or to heal us.” Share Email 2K Shares Stay on top of all of Vermont's criminal justice news.

The killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis and the protests that have followed over the past week, including in Burlington and Montpelier, have forced us to reckon with the reality that our state does not work for every resident, particularly for Black Vermonters. This is not the Vermont we want. Our state is 94 percent white. But Black Vermonters experience poverty at twice the rate of the rest of the state, despite being more likely to work. And as the efforts by many to collect and disseminate policing statistics across the state have made clear, Black Vermonters are much more likely to be stopped by police, to be searched, and to be incarcerated. And Black Vermonters have a higher rate of COVID-19 than any other group. None of this is an accident. And none of this is new. This is the result of centuries of policies intended to enslave, target, and exclude Black Americans to protect the power of the white majority, and it is embedded in Vermont’s economic, education, and justice systems. We applaud Gov. Phil Scott for acknowledging Vermont’s systemic racism at his press conference yesterday and the ongoing challenge of dismantling it. Dismantling systemic racism is urgent. It demands that each of us act now: listen, learn, protest, ask questions of elected officials and each other. There are opportunities to be part of community conversations in Vermont. Panel and Organizing for Racial Justice in Vermont will be held online tonight at 6:00. Hidden in Plain Sight: The Truth About Systemic Racism, a webinar open to anyone, will be held this Thursday at 6:00 PM. It was notable that at his press conference the governor cited the words of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.: “A riot is the language of the unheard.” Here’s more of what Dr. King said at Stanford University on April 14, 1967: “I think America must see that riots do not develop out of thin air. Certain conditions continue to exist in our society which must be condemned as vigorously as we condemn riots. But in the final analysis, a riot is the language of the unheard. And what is it that America has failed to hear? It has failed to hear that the plight of the Negro poor has worsened over the last few years. It has failed to hear that the promises of freedom and justice have not been met. And it has failed to hear that large segments of white society are more concerned about tranquility and the status quo than about justice, equality, and humanity. And so in a real sense our nation’s summers of riots are caused by our nation’s winters of delay. And as long as America postpones justice, we stand in the position of having these recurrences of violence and riots over and over again. Social justice and progress are the absolute guarantors of riot prevention.”",0.0

In all, nine states and the District of Columbia held primary elections to decide a series of state and federal contests, including the 2020 presidential race . With no real competition, Biden and President Donald Trump easily won their respective primary elections in Indiana, Rhode Island, Maryland, New Mexico, Montana and the night's biggest prize: Pennsylvania. Biden also won South Dakota. Voters waited in long lines hours after polls closed in some cases, brushing up against curfews in Washington, D.C., and Philadelphia, two cities rocked by protests following the police killing of George Floyd. Officials in both places said voters wouldn't be arrested for breaking curfew, but thousands of protesters defied the mayors' orders at the same time, setting up a potential clash with law enforcement agencies and National Guard troops patrolling the streets during a fifth night of social unrest. Pennsylvania, which offered the day's biggest trove of delegates, also represented a significant test case for Republicans and Democrats working to strengthen their operations in a premier general election battleground. Voters were forced to brave long lines in “militarized zones” because officials consolidated the vast majority of polling places in Philadelphia to minimize health risks, according to Erin Kramer, executive director of One Pennsylvania. She noted that some polling places in African American communities are in police stations. “Having to stand in line while police officers are entering and exiting the building on police business is not exactly how people want to spend their election day,” Kramer said. Biden was on the primary ballot in almost every state in his bid to unify Democrats behind his campaign against Trump. The former vice president is already the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, given that all his rivals have dropped out of the race, but he needs to win 89% of all delegates at stake on Tuesday to formally clinch the nomination. If he doesn't secure the needed delegates Tuesday, he has other opportunities to do so this month. Biden was in Philadelphia on Tuesday morning to deliver remarks about the civil unrest that has erupted across the nation. He didn’t talk about the primary, instead focusing his attention on Trump, whom Biden blasted as “more interested in power than in principle.” Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is not actively campaigning, having suspended his operation and endorsed Biden, but his name will appear on the ballots. On the eve of Tuesday's primaries, senior adviser Jeff Weaver encouraged progressives to vote for Sanders anyway. “People who support Bernie Sanders and his agenda, who want to maximize the influence of progressives at the convention, should cast their vote for Bernie Sanders,” Weaver said, reminding voters that the Vermont senator is seeking leverage to shape the party's platform and rules. The comments serve as a reminder that Biden may have no legitimate Democratic rivals remaining but must still win over skeptical activists from his party’s far-left flank, who worry he’s too close to the political establishment. Party unity will likely be an afterthought this week, however, as more immediate health and safety concerns dominate the national conversation. The coronavirus death toll has surged past 100,000 nationwide, and thousands of new cases are reported each day. At the same time, several major cities, including some voting Tuesday, are grappling with protests. Some voters said Trump’s increasingly tough tone toward protesters inspired them to participate in the democratic process. Nicholas Autiello, who works in finance in Rhode Island, said he was disturbed by police driving back peaceful demonstrators near the White House on Monday. “Last night, we have a president who is acting like a dictator,” Autiello said. “So being able to come out here this morning and fill in a circle next to a name for someone who I know will restore honor and decency to the presidency was so important.” Political groups have had to adjust as some states move to a system that relies largely on voting by mail. They include Montana, where all 56 counties decided to vote entirely by mail. Voting rights watchdogs in multiple states have expressed concerns about access to mail ballots, confusion about deadlines and a shortage of poll workers that could lead to long lines. Those voting Tuesday include the District of Columbia, Indiana, Maryland, Montana, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and South Dakota. Two other states holding primary elections, Idaho and Iowa, chose its presidential nominee early in the year and is now focused on other offices. “We are in unique times, and voting is a unique challenge for people,” said Josh Schwerin, chief strategist for the pro-Democrat super PAC Priorities USA. He said that his organization and others will be watching closely on Tuesday “to see how well it works, where issues are and where obstacles have been put in place.” ___ Associated Press writer Rodrique Ngowi in Providence, R.I., and Terry Spencer in West Palm Beach, Fla., contributed to this report. ___ Catch up on the 2020 election campaign with AP experts on our weekly politics podcast, “Ground Game.” ___ This story has been corrected to show there are nine states voting, not seven.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of Calif., reading from the Bible, reacts to President Donald Trump during a news conference at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, Tuesday, June 2, 2020. (Source: AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta) Pelosi invoked Biblical scripture to reject Trump's clampdown on peaceful protesters outside the White House and she drew on past presidents — including George H.W. Bush in the aftermath of the Rodney King unrest and Barack Obama following the death of Eric Garner — as models of the nation's chief executive at a time of crisis. ""We would hope that the president of the United States would follow the lead of so many presidents before him to be a healer in chief and not a fanner of the flame,"" Pelosi said. As pleas for reconciliation over the country's long struggle with racial inequality were met with demands for accountability over George Floyd's death at the hands of police in Minneapolis, there was a shifting tone coming from Congress. Gone are the days when ""Black Lives Matter"" protests were met simply with ""Blue Lives Matter"" retorts in support of law enforcement. Instead, Congress seems to have heard the protesters outside its doors. ""You can understand the outrage,"" McConnell, the Republican Senate leader, said. McConnell said it's not only the death of Floyd at the hands of white police in Minnesota drawing protesters into the streets, but of other African Americans, including Breonna Taylor in his home-state of Kentucky. ""There is no question that there is residual racism in America,"" McConnell told reporters. ""It's been a longtime dilemma and we all wish we could get to a better place."" As the world watches a nation in turmoil, Democrats and some Republicans are swiftly preparing inquiries into the president's actions against the protesters and a legislative response to the police violence and racial inequality at the heart of marches erupting in communities nationwide. Some lawmakers, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., joined the protests. Trump was widely criticized for clearing protesters late Monday from outside the White House so he could walk across the street to hold up a Bible outside historic St. John's Church. It was viewed as a photo opportunity and criticized by the congregation's bishop. McConnell declined to directly comment on Trump's handling of the crisis. However, several Republicans on Tuesday suggested it would be better if Trump helped calm the nation rather than escalate the already tense conditions in Washington and across the country. ""I'm against clearing out a peaceful protest for a photo op that treats the Word of God as a political prop,"" said Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Nebraska, in a statement. ""Every public servant in America should be lowering the temperature."" Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer called on Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Army Gen. Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to refuse the use of military helicopters and tear gas for ""ugly stunts"" like the one Monday. Senate Democrats proposed, and Republicans rejected, a resolution condemning the president's actions. McConnell offered instead a resolution condemning rioting and police violence against black Americans, which Schumer rebuffed as insufficient. Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas said he was ""glad the president led"" by clearing the protesters from the park. Cruz and other Republicans blamed outside agitators from the ""antifa"" anti-fascist movement for intervening in otherwise peaceful protests that resulted in looting and other property damage. Still, for a growing number of lawmakers there is an undeniable pattern of inequality in the treatment of black Americans by law enforcement, and they want to address it. Several Republicans, including Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, called Floyd's death a ""murder."" One, Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., said he understood there's a difference between his experience telling his sons to call the police if they need help and black families warning children to be cautious around law enforcement so as not to risk being harmed. ""That's a different kind of America and I think people are understanding those protests make sense,"" Blunt said. More than 40 bills — from banning police choke holds and racial profiling to preventing the federal transfer of military equipment to local law enforcement to a long-sought federal anti-lynching law — are now under consideration on Capitol Hill. One House Democrat probed the Secret Service for any communication about Trump's ordering the clampdown on protesters outside the White House. Using words like ""dictator,"" ""fascist"" and other terms to describe Trump's actions, Democrats pleaded with Americans to stand with those working to improve police treatment of minority populations. ""Racism is bad for everyone,"" said Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif. She and Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., among the nation's few black senators post-Reconstruction, spoke of their own childhoods growing up in civil rights era, a legacy of the nation's long path toward a more inclusive and representative government. With the Capitol still partly closed due to the coronavirus, a pandemic that is disproportionately striking black Americans, Congress is now confronting another deepening crisis. The Congressional Black Caucus announced a virtual town hall Friday with civil rights leaders, and House Judiciary Committee chairman Jerrold Nadler is planning a hearing next week on policing. Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., said House lawmakers could be recalled to Washington this month to vote on legislation to address police and other reforms. Schumer urged McConnell to consider law enforcement reforms legislation by July 4. ___ Associated Press writer Matthew Daly contributed to this report. Copyright 2020 Associated Press.

Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDigger Backers of a bill that would change the standard for when police are justified in using deadly force in Vermont say they are hopeful the legislation will be propelled by the officer-involved killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis and the outrage it has sparked.  Hundreds of people took part in protests in Burlington and around the state over the weekend as other protests and riots went on across the country over racial disparities in police violence.  However, Rep. Anne Donahue, R-Northfield, the lead sponsor of H.808, doesn’t believe that the renewed focus on the issue will mobilize Vermont’s lawmakers to pass the legislation this session, at least not as introduced.  Get all of VTDigger's daily news. You'll never miss a story with our daily headlines in your inbox. “I do think this will potentially raise the profile of this enough to say, ‘We do have to get something moving in this regard this year,’” Donahue said Monday of her proposed legislation, which was the focus of a hearing that drew a large crowd earlier this year. The bill remains in the House Government Operations Committee.  The state’s response to the coronavirus and budget issues have taken up much of the Legislature’s time over the past two months. Police violence has been among many policy issues pushed to the back.  Protesters in Vermont and across the country have taken to the streets over the past week in response to the killing last Monday of 46-year-old Floyd, a black man, as a white Minneapolis police officer kneeled on Floyd’s neck for over eight minutes.  [Related: Why do deaths at the hands of police keep rising in Vermont?] Rep. Kevin “Coach” Christie, D-White River Junction and chair of the Vermont Human Rights Commission, is also a sponsor of H.808. He said while he was aware that lawmakers need to spend time on Covid-19 matters and the related budget issues, he hoped that the measure, as well as others — such as improving data collection throughout the criminal justice system to help track racial disparities — would advance as well.  VTDigger is underwritten by: “The pieces of legislation around systemic racism and addressing those issues will probably rise, we would hope so,” he said Monday. “If they don’t, that’s not a good thing.”  Many law enforcement agencies around Vermont, including the Burlington Police Department and Vermont State Police, issued statements condemning Floyd’s killing. James Lyall, executive director of the Vermont chapter of American Civil Liberties Union, said those “same voices” have often stood in the way of police reforms in the state, including H.808.  “H-808 is just one example, one of the more recent examples,” Lyall said, adding that legislation aimed at addressing racial disparities and police violence have often been met with similar opposition.  “Any time there is a criminal justice reform bill, or certainly any time there is a police reform bill,” Lyall said, “there is a lot of testimony from police, and a lot of deference to police, and not as much to other voices.”  Rep. Anne Donahue, R-Northfield, speaks on the floor of the House at the Statehouse on May 14, 2019. Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDigger H.808 in Vermont is modeled after legislation approved in California last year changing that state’s legal standard for deadly force by a law enforcement officer.  Under that California legislation, which is considered the toughest standard for police use of force in the country, law enforcement in that state can only use deadly force when “necessary,” or when no other options exist.  Donahue said Monday that she didn’t expect when she introduced the legislation that it would sail to approval as is.  “It was never my expectation that the first year introducing a bill that would completely change the standard for police use of force would pass,” she said. “But it would be very much my hope that we would start in motion a process of evaluating that change.”  She added, “In legislative speak that means some kind of a working committee that would put the time and the energy needed to evaluate how it could be reapplied in Vermont.”  Gov. Phil Scott, in response to questions about the legislation during a press conference Monday, said he didn’t know much about the details of the bill.  “We are evolving as we speak and we want to take this time to reflect on what we’re doing, do it better,” he said. “I’m just not aware of the bill in particular and where it stands at this point in time.”  Michael Schirling, Vermont’s public safety commissioner, testified earlier this year on the legislation. The commissioner said at that time it was too soon to adopt a measure similar to California’s, without first seeing how it plays out in that state.  “Let’s hold fast and see what happens in California, because they have completely broken the glass on 50 years of case law relative to this topic, and we don’t know what’s going to happen,” Schirling told lawmakers. “So let’s see.”  On Monday, Schirling said that remains his view of the legislation.  VTDigger is underwritten by: Attorney General TJ Donovan said Monday that he supports moving to the California standard, though he believed there were some pieces of the current legislation that needed further discussion. For example, in Vermont the current standard involves what a “reasonable person” would do, versus the term “reasonable officer” in the proposed legislation. That language difference, he said, is something that needs to be discussed to understand all the ramifications.  Vermont Attorney General TJ Donovan, speaking before a joint legislative committee. Photo by Mike Dougherty/VTDigger “I would certainly support engaging with the Legislature on this bill,” he said, adding, “Let’s engage in the process, let’s come out with a bill that changes the standard.”  A VTDigger analysis shows there were 17 fatal police encounters over the past decade. According to Vermont State Police statistics, there were five trooper-involved shootings in the state in 2019. That was one more than the previous year. There was one shooting involving a Vermont State Police trooper in 2017 and none in 2016.  Those statistics only take into account shootings involving state police, Vermont’s largest law enforcement agency, which provides the information on its website. Once investigations were completed, the troopers’ actions in all of them were deemed justified by the Vermont Attorney General’s Office and the county state’s attorney’s offices.  H.808 would establish a statewide policy, unlike the legal standard that is applied now in Vermont based on case law. That Vermont standard relies in large part on whether a reasonable person would have acted in the same manner.  According to the bill, law enforcement officers may use deadly force only when necessary in defense of human life.  “In determining whether deadly force is necessary,” the legislation stated, “officers shall evaluate each situation in light of the particular circumstances of each case and shall use other available resources and techniques if reasonably safe and feasible to an objectively reasonable officer.”  Share Email 276 Shares Stay on top of all of Vermont's criminal justice news.

Hundreds of protesters pressed into the parking lot of the Burlington Police Department Saturday evening, chanting through cloth face masks as black Vermonters confronted Burlingon’s police leadership. In the police department parking lot It was one of numerous protests across the country in response to the death of George Floyd, a black man who died on Monday after a white Minneapolis police officer kneeled on his neck for several minutes while Floyd was handcuffed and pinned to the ground. Floyd told the officer ""I can't breathe,"" and the incident, which was recorded on video by a bystander, has reignited concerns about police violence towards minorities. Standing on the bed of a blue pickup truck with a megaphone, organizer and UVM student Harmony Edosomwan read the names of five black men who she said had been beaten or killed by Burlington Police officers over the last decade. At the protest, police were hard to spot until Edosomwan called out to the department’s interim police chief, Jennifer Morrison. Morrison, a retired Colchester police chief, became interim chief of the Burlington Police Department in December after former chief Brandon del Pozo resigned. The crowd chanted “come outside” until Morrison and deputy chief Jon Murad appeared and made their way through a parted crowd. They stood at the feet of Edosomwan. “How do you expect black and brown people and just people in general to feel safe on the streets if you’re letting people like Jason Bellavance and Corey Campbell still patrol?” she asked the city’s top officers. Video footage made public last year showed Bellavance pushing a black graduate student involved in a verbal altercation outside a bar against a brick wall, injuring him. Cambell, who was present during that incident, was also involved in the death of Douglas Kilburn. Morrison told Edosomwan, ""It’s not something that we’re going to solve tonight."" The day before the protest, Morrison released a statement condemning the actions of Minnesota police, saying, ""the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police officers is an atrocity."" Hundreds marched to the Burlington Police Department parking lot Saturday: The Vermont State Police made a similar statement on Friday. Col. Matt Birmingham, head of the state police, said video of the Floyd encounter was ""beyond disturbing."" ""This kind of conduct has no place in policing,"" Birmingham said. After confronting Morrison, Edosomwan then passed the megaphone to a handful of black men and women who confronted the chief and deputy with their own allegations of police misconduct. “Six years ago I was held at gunpoint from your officers, trying to say that I stole my own vehicle, right on Monroe Street right around the corner,” said Randy Wade, who stood directly in front of Morrison and Murad. “And none of you motherf------ ever apologized to me.” Wade said he had been a volunteer at the food shelf and worked with Bernie Sanders. “You guys made me hate everything I love about this state and I moved to Houston, because I was tired of the bulls--- and all the racist bigotry.” When the officers offered Wade a business card, he rejected it. “Apologize, apologize,” the crowd chanted. After pouring a gallon jug of red liquid symbolizing blood shed by black people in the city, Edosomwan addressed Morrison and Murad once more. “If another black person dies ...” she started, “Or assault!” a man shouted. “Or harassment!” a woman yelled, “Trust me, we are all going to be here, and this building is going down,” Edosomwan finished, gesturing toward the police department. Morrison responds In a phone call Sunday morning, Morrison called the experience “uncomfortable” and said it wasn’t a position law enforcement “normally would allow themselves to be in.” But, she said, it was the right thing to do. “I think it's OK for me to be uncomfortable for a while, because I'm very confident that people of color experience discomfort at the hands of police,” she said. Morrison also said she thought her department’s strategy for the evening had proven successful. She said she had staffed the protest with only a few officers in polo shirts rather than full uniforms. “I think that what we've seen in other cities is that when you put out long skirmish lines, just waiting for something to happen, then something's going to happen.” Morrison said the department was prepared in case of violence. What does this feel like? Saturday evening began more quietly, with an estimated 1,000 people trickling into Burlington’s Battery Park. Most stood or sat in clusters apart from one another. Social distancing became difficult, however, as more arrived and the green filled up. In the Facebook event for the protest, organizers encouraged those with COVID-19 symptoms to stay home, and those uncomfortable with being around others to participate via car. At 6 p.m. on the dot, a long line of drivers passed by on Park Street, honking and holding signs. But in a series of short interviews with in-park protestors, in which VPR asked the question, “What does it feel like to be you right now?” none mentioned concerns about COVID-19. Essex resident Ike Deboulet said he “woke up this morning, was hurt. Like this whole entire week was hard, from what happened in Central Park to Minneapolis.” Looking around at the growing crowd, he added: “But today seemed like everybody in unity here. It feels good, knowing that we're not alone.” Nearby, Burlington resident Dylan Kunkel waved a long pole bearing two flags: one black with a fist, for Black Lives Matter, and then the rainbow Pride flag. “I'm a queer man, and our rights came with a riot,” Kunkel said. “And they're still coming with riots. And I think if we're not here pushing and, you know, fighting with an uprising to say that we deserve these rights, then we're not doing our part.” Myla Jacobs and Phinnize Brown both identified as biracial and said they were at Saturday’s protest in support of those they cared for. “As somebody who doesn’t look African American, I feel like this is me contributing to the black community and to my fellow brothers and sisters,” Jacobs said. Brown said he mostly grew up with white family members, and didn’t experience a lot of black culture. “I didn’t realize what it was like to actually be a black person in today’s society until about a year ago, when I had an incident where I was stopped and frisked,” Brown said. “And it made me realize that Vermont isn’t a safe place for people of color either, and that it's hard to really be who you are in today's world.” That today’s world still required protests for racial justice made Underhill resident Janice Solek-Tefft feel “raw.” “We’re old,” she said, motioning to her husband, Kenneth Tefft. “I’ve been an activist since I went to Kent State. I graduated the year of the Kent State shootings. I've been fighting for justice for people of color all my life. And I'm just I've had enough. I'm tired.” And yet, as Burlington resident Riley Brown noted, not everyone in his life feels the same sense of urgency. “As I'm looking around and having groups of friends, especially being in Vermont, who are still just sharing memes and talking about plans to play video games, it's hard to understand how everything hasn't stopped for them,” Brown said. “We have a tendency to look at these issues as if they're far away, and we're in our safe little bubble where these issues don't exist.” ""You will give them a reason to hit us"" Following the first portion of Saturday’s protest – remarks, a song and poetry at Battery Park’s bandshell – protesters made their way across the street to Burlington’s police station chanting, “Hey hey, ho ho, racist cops have got to go.” As hundreds passed by, two young white men could be seen with spray cans. One, with a black can, wrote the letters “BLM,” an acronym for Black Lives Matter, on the wall of the police station. Another was just pulling a red spray can out of his backpack when an organizer wearing a ""Black Lives Matter"" t-shirt, Zanevia Wilcox, intervened. “Do not touch this building!” she yelled. “You will give them a reason to hit us black people. They will not see you.” The man put his red spray can back into his backpack, and continued on with the crowd. Correction: An earlier version of the story indicated Harmony Edosomwan was an organizer for Black Lives Matter of Greater Burlington, but she is not. It also misspelled Phinnize Brown's name, and indicated Zanevia Wilcox was an organizer specifically for Black Lives Matter of Greater Burlington, which she did not confirm.",0.0

VMS President, Catherine Schneider, M.D. and VMS President-Elect, Simha Ravven, M.D., state, “The VMS stands with the Vermont State Police, the American Medical Association (AMA), the American Psychiatric Association (APA) and the American Academy of Pediatrics in Vermont (AAPVT) in denouncing not only police brutality against Black people, but in recognizing that racism and violence against people of color is unacceptable, unwarranted and a detriment to our country. The continued discrimination against people of color has deep lasting health impacts, as well as divisive social impacts. We cannot have a healthy nation if we continue to marginalize and harm any sector of our population.” There are harmful health impacts of structural racism and racism in law enforcement. The AMA’s May 29 statement condemning police brutality notes: “Research demonstrates that racially marginalized communities are disproportionally subject to police force… An increased prevalence of police encounters is linked to elevated stress and anxiety levels, along with increased rates of high blood pressure, diabetes and asthma—and fatal complications of those comorbid conditions.” The Vermont Medical Society supports the Vermont State Police in condemning police brutality in the death of George Floyd and their commitment to fair and impartial policing, de-escalation, and relationship building in communities of color. “The civil unrest taking place in America is a call to action to all Americans to address the longstanding racial inequalities facing the Black community,” said APA CEO and Medical Director Saul Levin, M.D. “Centuries of systemic and institutional racism toward Black Americans has led to decreased access to health care and multiple adverse health outcomes—as recently seen during the COVID-19 pandemic—in addition to anxiety and lower life-expectancy”. Dr. Rebecca Bell, M.D., President of the American Academy of Pediatrics Vermont Chapter said, “Racism is a public health issue and a social determinant of health that creates toxic stress and impacts health. Children will not be able to reach their full potential until we prevent and counteract these experiences for all children--in medicine and everyday life. The AAPVT Chapter condemns violence, especially when perpetrated by authorities, and calls for a deep examination of how to improve the role of policing. Systemic violence requires systemic response.” We are watching these tragic events unfold during the COVID-19 global health pandemic, where in Vermont and across the nation, incidence of more severe illness is disproportionately impacting certain racial and ethnic populations and exposing the uneven access to care that leads to disparities in health outcomes. The VMS is committed to addressing bias in health care, as evidenced by our policy from 2018, in which we resolve to support systems designed to combat biases within the health care system and to work to mitigate the unequal treatment of patients and health care professionals. The VMS grieves for the families of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor, and countless others, where race was a determining factor in their interaction with law enforcement and ultimately their untimely deaths. Systemic racism not only destroys the social cohesion of our nation, it also produces devasting health impacts born from trauma, chronic stress and differential access to health care. We as a State and a nation must do better for the health of all.

This undated file photo provided by Christopher Harris shows George Floyd. Floyd died May 25, after he was pinned to the pavement by a police officer who put his knee on the handcuffed black man's neck until he stopped breathing. (Source: Christopher Harris via AP) Gov. Tim Walz and the Minnesota Department of Human Rights announced the filing of the formal complaint at a news conference Tuesday afternoon. The governor and Human Rights Commissioner Rebecca Lucero said they hope to reach agreement with the city to identify short-term ways to address the police department's history of racial discrimination, and use the investigation to find long-term solutions for systemic change. Lucero said their goal is to negotiate a consent decree with the city that courts could enforce with injunctions and financial penalties. There are precedents, she said, including a consent decree approved in Chicago last year after the U.S. Justice Department found a long history of racial bias and excessive use of force by police. Widely seen bystander video showing Floyd’s death has sparked sometimes violent protests around the world. The officer, Derek Chauvin, has been fired and charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Three other officers involved were fired but have not been charged. “We know that deeply seated issues exist,"" the governor said. ""And the reason I know it is we saw the casual nature of the erasing of George Floyd’s life and humanity. We also know by the reaction of the community. They expected nothing to happen, and the reason is because nothing did happen for so many times.” Walz said the investigation into the police department's policies, procedures and practices over the past 10 years will determine if the force has engaged in systemic discrimination toward people of color, and root it out. Lucero will lead the investigation. All 12 members of the Minneapolis City Council endorsed a statement read by Council President Lisa Bender at a news conference later Tuesday in support of the investigation. “We urge the state to use its full weight to hold the Minneapolis Police Department accountable for any and all abuses of power and harms to our community and stand ready to aid in this process as full partners,” the council said. Mayor Jacob Frey said the state's intervention will help break what he called a stalemate on reform. “For years in Minneapolis, police chiefs and elected officials committed to change have been thwarted by police union protections and laws that severely limit accountability among police departments,"" Frey said in a statement. “I welcome today’s announcement because breaking through those persistent barriers, shifting the culture of policing, and addressing systemic racism will require all of us working hand in hand.” A police department spokesman and the president of the officers' union didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. The FBI is also investigating whether police willfully deprived Floyd of his civil rights. The Minnesota Department of Human Rights enforces the state’s human rights act, particularly as it applies to discrimination in employment, housing, education, public accommodations and public services. Mediation is one of its first-choice tools, but the cases it files can lead to fuller investigations and sometimes end up in litigation. The Minneapolis Police Department has faced decades of allegations of brutality and other discrimination against African Americans and other minorities, even within the department itself. Critics say its culture resists change, despite the elevation of Medaria Arradondo as its first black police chief in 2017. Arradondo himself was among five black officers who sued the police department in 2007 over alleged discrimination in promotions, pay, and discipline. They said in their lawsuit that the department had a history of tolerating racism and discrimination. The city settled the lawsuit for $740,000. State Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington, who was neighboring St. Paul’s second black police chief, said good officers should welcome the investigation. He co-chaired a working group with Attorney General Keith Ellison that reported back in February on ways to reduce police-involved deadly force encounters. “I’ve been a cop for 40 years. I have lived in this system that they’re talking about reforming. ... The cops I talk to, the cops I’ve worked with since 1977 to date will tell you, they want change,” Harrington said. “They don’t want to work in a flawed system. They don’t want to have to be wearing gas masks. They don’t want to have to be on riot control duty.” Earlier Tuesday, an attorney for Floyd's family again decried the official autopsy that found his death was caused by cardiac arrest as police restrained him and compressed his neck. The medical examiner also listed fentanyl intoxication and recent methamphetamine use, but not as the cause of death. A separate autopsy commissioned for Floyd’s family concluded that that he died of asphyxiation due to neck and back compression. “The cause of death was that he was starving for air. It was lack of oxygen. And so everything else is a red herring to try to throw us off,” family attorney Ben Crump said. He said the Hennepin County medical examiner went to great lengths to try to convince the public that what was shown on bystander video didn’t cause Floyd to die. Ellison told ABC's “Good Morning America” that prosecutors are working as fast as they can to determine whether more charges will be filed. Copyright 2020 Associated Press. All rights reserved.",0.0

On Tuesday afternoon, one man was arrested as people protested at Taylor Park in St. Albans. St. Albans Police officials declined to comment Tuesday night and the man who was arrested was released later that night. He declined to speak to WCAX News. Despite that one arrest toward the end of the protest, the event remained peaceful, but there was a brief confrontation between protesters and a small group of men across the street. As protesters chanted ""black lives matter,"" a rallying cry for racial justice and an end to police brutality against black people, a group of men across the street shouted ""all lives matter"" back at them. ""They said that 'all lives matter' but all lives can't matter until black lives matter, too,"" said protest organizer Paige Lytch. ""They just want to say what they want to say and we got our point across."" Many people in the BLM movement feel all lives matter misses the mark and fails to confront issues of systemic racism black people face in the U.S. Ronald Porter, one of the men in the other group says that wasn't his intention. He says he supports Black Lives Matter but wanted to offer a different perspective. ""In my opinion, it's where it should be -- all lives matter. There should be no division. But again, I know that your race of people are going through hell and there should be more talk and there should be more done,"" Porter said. Some people driving by also got caught up in the mix, screaming at protesters from their windows and provoking them. Some people tried to cross the street to confront the other group but they ultimately stayed where they were and the confrontation did not escalate from there. Melanie French also went back and forth with protesters. She says she agrees with what they were protesting but not how. ""I'm on the side of justice. I’m not on the side of people just angrily protesting. They said it was going to be a peaceful protest. To me, this is not a peaceful protest,"" she said. ""I just want to say that if we keep pushing and keep talking and keep screaming that someone's gotta hear us eventually,"" said Brittaney Malik. Protesters say they plan to attend more protests as the nation continues to push for justice for Floyd. They say they’re not interested in rioting or looting, as we’ve seen in other cities across the country.

However, the recent article about Vermont Packinghouse has me reconsidering my subscription (“Rising to meat demand,” May 24). Glorifying a slaughterhouse that has been under scrutiny for violations, and even had a petition against it, made me physically sick. The petition is still open and has more than 109,000 signatures. The place is a nightmare, and the article talked about animals as if they are just blades of grass to be mowed. Would it have been so hard to interview someone who could have added another point of view regarding the animals themselves? Let’s be clear and talk about facts. You do not need meat to live and be healthy. Meat production and raising livestock destroys the environment, even on cute little local farms. Humane meat and slaughter is a myth. Pigs like the ones that were pictured in the article being mutilated are actually smarter than the dog next to you on the couch. In the future, it would benefit newspapers covering articles involving the unnecessary taking of the lives of animals to investigate the business and any controversy surrounding it and get a variety of points of view. Let the readers know all sides, please. KRISTINA SNYDER Chester, N.H. The arts are more essential than ever I beg to differ strongly with Dick Tracy’s recent Forum letter claiming that the arts are not essential (“Piling huge debt on future generations,” May 28). If he has never gone to a concert or a show, read a book or enjoyed looking at sculptures or paintings in private or public places, then I suppose he has a point. The arts mean nothing to him. However, they mean a lot to others, especially in times like this, when we are confined to our homes. TV series and films are art. The actors, directors and producers are all part of an artistic community. So are the musicians and singers and authors who supply us with the songs we like to listen to and the books we like to read. I do understand the plight of our farmers, who are struggling terribly and need our support in any way we can give it. But why is there a belief that if one group gets some help it is necessarily taken away from another? In a reasonably just society, there would be enough for all. And is the law of supply and demand really “natural”? ULRIKE RAINER Hanover There’s a madness to Trump’s method Bob Scobie’s opinion column (“Why Trump insists on ‘going it alone,’ ” May 28) was a poignant and insightful political and strategic analysis of the subject. I was particularly struck with the first paragraph’s insight that President Donald Trump doesn’t actually ask his cult members for their “help,” but rather to trust him and follow him no matter what. While Scobie’s political analysis is helpful, it does tend to presume that there is intentionality in Trump’s actions — that is, a method in his madness. Taking a psychological perspective, I would contend that there is a madness in his method. Which is to say, the best way to understand anything Trump says or does is to remember that he is a megalomaniacal narcissist. Period. PHILIP ELLER Norwich Why are vape shops deemed essential? I am concerned that vaping businesses are considered essential during this pandemic crisis. These products have been deemed more dangerous than tobacco products. They are getting into the hands of our youth via adults and are being passed on. We have other businesses that are shut down and struggling to survive. I have contacted New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu’s office, left messages twice and sent emails twice, asking for a explanation on this subject. I feel this deserves a response from the governor. PENNY HULL Cornish Follow the example set by Dr. King For days, people have been destroying property, but President Donald Trump doesn’t know how to stop the destruction. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. set a good example of how to protest without destruction and burning property. King was a leader, but he didn’t teach to destroy property while protesting. Please, President Trump, tell the people to act like Dr. King. RUKIAH OERTLY Hartford Trump’s corruption and incompetence Yo, America. How’s the Donald Trump thing working out for ya? Let’s see. Start with the utterly botched COVID-19 response; the tens of millions of Americans abruptly unemployed; the deep tax cuts and other financial shenanigans for the uber-wealthy; and the mad, damn-the-torpedoes rush to “reopen” the economy, placing at risk the elderly, the vulnerable and those of us who don’t have the good fortune of getting paid to Zoom from home. And let’s not forget that, for days now, many of our nation’s cities have been blanketed by a thick carpet of smoke, tear gas and pepper spray. Could it be that the people have finally woken up to the Trump administration’s corruption and gross incompetence? Are the chickens coming home to roost? MARK LATHAM Hartford Those were the great old days ... Whenever I see a MAGA cap or banners with “Make America Great Again” emblazoned on them, my first reaction is to ask in what period of American history do President Donald Trump and his supporters find the special “greatness” that they wish to restore? Surely it can’t be the Roaring ’20s, with the evils of gangsterism and bootlegging spawned by Prohibition, nor can it be the Great Depression of the 1930s and the rise of Franklin Roosevelt’s quasi-socialist New Deal. And they can’t want to return to the years of World War II, when more than 400,000 Americans lost their lives. It must be the 1950s, the great Eisenhower years, the happy years of my own youth. It was the time of LP recordings and paperback books, revolutionary developments for students of the arts and literature. An impecunious undergraduate could actually put together a library of great books at little cost. Record players were available at moderate cost, and recordings of great classical music, while not entirely inexpensive, were nevertheless within reach. Great films, too. It was a great time for anyone interested in learning about and celebrating the arts. And the great smokes! I can still remember my first Lucky Strike, probably at 13; it’s a memory worthy of Marcel Proust’s madeleine. Medical doctors were featured frequently in the Saturday Evening Post and Collier’s. The ads for Camels included the great sales pitch, “Try their costlier tobaccos on your ‘T-Zone’ — T for throat; T for taste.” And, of course, they were right. They were doctors in white jackets. If they smoked Camels and found them soothing, why would I dare to disagree? Doctors are once again being recruited, not by Camel cigarettes this time but by Republican political operatives to “publicly support the president” and come together for the war on health care. Once again, I have a question: Will the president also want them to endorse his personal promotion of hydroxychloroquine? A final word, from an old smoker and a registered voter, caveat emptor.

Officers with the Burlington Police Department stood by a heavy-duty emergency response truck in a gravel parking lot on North Avenue. The Vermont State Police stationed a tactical team at the nearby fire station, where another tactical truck held impact rounds, irritant gas and riot shields. But the police had no need for the specialized equipment. Well more than 1,000 people, led by members of Vermont's communities of color, converged in Battery Park to join the raucous, outraged demonstrations that have swept the country since George Floyd, a black man, died at the hands of Minneapolis police during a May 25 arrest. A day before the Burlington protest, Derek Chauvin, the Minneapolis officer who planted his knee into Floyd's neck for more than eight minutes, had been charged with third-degree murder. His arrest did little to quell the public anger. Those marching in the streets wanted wholesale reform. ""Is my son next?"" one Burlington protester's sign read. ""White Americans are the biggest threat to America,"" read another. ""Stop giving bigots badges,"" demanded a third. The placards would be left in piles around 1 North Avenue and on the windshields of parked police cruisers, but only after protest leaders confronted local cops directly. Hundreds chanted for interim Police Chief Jennifer Morrison to come outside. She and Deputy Chief Jon Murad obliged, then looked up and listened to protest leader Harmony Edosomwan, who stood in the bed of a pickup truck. ""Are you familiar with the person Jason Bellavance?"" Edosomwan asked through a megaphone, referring to a Burlington police sergeant who was disciplined for using excessive force in 2018. The incident, which involved Bellavance pushing a black man into a wall, knocking him unconscious, was captured on video. It's currently at the center of an ongoing federal civil rights lawsuit against the city. Edosomwan also asked about Officer Cory Campbell, who punched a white man during an altercation outside a hospital last year. Douglas Kilburn died days later. Campbell was disciplined for using profanity during the interaction, but police defended his use of force. Edosomwan and the jeering crowd brushed aside Morrison's attempts to respond. Then the protest leader, a prominent student activist at the University of Vermont, held up a clear gallon jug filled with red liquid. She dumped it onto the pavement at the feet of the police leaders. ""Their blood is on your hands,"" Edosomwan said, referring to people killed by cops. And if police kill — or assault — another person in Burlington, Edosomwan warned, protesters would return to burn the police station down. By the time the crowd peacefully dispersed, a Black Lives Matter flag flew atop the police station; the building's walls were tagged with graffiti. The minor vandalism may have been more widespread if not for a black organizer who chastised a spray-paint-wielding white man. ""Do not touch this building!"" she yelled, according to a Vermont Public Radio reporter who witnessed the scene. ""You will give them a reason to hit us black people. They will not see you."" click to enlarge James Buck Protesters surrounding the Burlington Police Department The intense, widespread activism quickly caught the attention of state officials, who issued rare, direct condemnations of the Minneapolis officers. ""The public needs to know we stand with them,"" Capt. Garry Scott, the Vermont State Police director of fair and impartial policing, said in a statement last Friday. The topic consumed much of Gov. Phil Scott's Monday press conference, briefings that for months have been dedicated to the state's coronavirus response. The governor called for prosecutors to charge the three officers who watched Chauvin pin Floyd's neck to the pavement, as well. ""My heart goes out to all people of color across the nation who, even though they live in different communities, carry this trauma every time something like this happens,"" he said. ""In the greatest country in the world, no one should stand for this,"" Scott continued. ""No one should make excuses for this. And no one should ignore this. We must all make clear: Enough is enough."" He also announced that Xusana Davis, the state's executive director of racial equity, would chair a new task force to tackle systemic racism. The group, Scott said, would ""evaluate structures of support for racially diverse populations,"" review state laws around hate speech and study ways to encourage more people of color to run for public office. Smaller but sizable protests have taken place in Rutland, Brattleboro, Montpelier, Derby Line and St. Albans. In the latter city, a couple hundred people on Tuesday chanted ""Police the police,"" and ""Black lives matter"" in a downtown park, videos from the event show. People of color have been prodding Vermont institutions to act for years. In 2016, students at UVM raised a Black Lives Matter flag on campus, but it was swiftly stolen by a white fraternity pledge. In 2018, former state representative Kiah Morris of Bennington resigned her seat after white supremacists harassed her online. Last year, when video emerged of Bellavance injuring Jérémie Meli, Black Lives Matter activists demanded that the City of Burlington fire Bellavance and two other officers who had been on the scene. An online petition they created at the time has circulated again in recent days and now has 36,000 signatures. Last year's galvanizing incidents in Burlington resulted in the formation of a special committee on policing, which proposed several revisions to the police department's use-of-force policy in February. On Monday, Chief Morrison fast-tracked two of the proposed changes by issuing a departmental order that made them effective immediately. Under the new rules, officers must intervene any time they witness misconduct or excessive force by a fellow officer, and they must prioritize de-escalation whenever feasible. ""Right now, the community needs to know that we are doing everything possible to prevent anything like what we saw in Minneapolis from happening here,"" the chief said during a briefing with the mayor. Later that day, Burlington city councilors passed a resolution condemning racism, police brutality and Floyd's death. But even that simple gesture proved controversial and required a protracted debate about whether the resolution should include a line thanking Burlington cops for their ""non-confrontational and professional response"" during the protest on Saturday. Councilor Perri Freeman (P-Central District) argued passionately — but unsuccessfully — against including the appreciative note. ""With the unbelievable anguish that this nation is experiencing right now over the unbelievable violence and the brutality that communities have been experiencing, I cannot fathom how this is even remotely appropriate,"" Freeman said. Less controversially, the resolution called upon the city to raise the Black Lives Matter flag outside of city hall for the remainder of the COVID-19 state of emergency. Officials already had such a flag on hand. Morrison said police removed one that belonged to protesters from the station on Sunday morning and replaced it with an American flag. She said she asked organizers whether they wanted it back but ""received no reply."" Instead, she gave the flag to the city parks department. For now, it's flying over Church Street.",0.0

ALBANS, Vt. – A peaceful rally to protest police brutality and systemic racism was interrupted Tuesday when a protestor armed with a handgun was arrested after allegedly threatening a man during an argument. Police say Christopher Reynolds, 22, of Milton confronted a counterprotestor who had crossed the street to argue with the protestors. According to the victim’s statment to police, Reynolds allegedly put his hand on the grip of his gun, which was being carried on his hip, and said “do something or I certainly will.” Police say video evidence supports the victim’s allegation. A woman with the counterprotestor, who was shouting “All lives matter” before crossing the street, called the police. On Wednesday, police confirmed that Reynolds was taken into custody and charged with aggravated assault. Other onlookers yelled at protestors throughout the evening, with one telling them to “protest something real.” At one point, another woman walked across the street to speak, and several protestors quieted the crowd to hear what she had to say. Earlier, more than 100 people peacefully protested at Taylor Park. Two protestors, Frank Spiese and Brittney Malik, described why they attended. “At this point, I think we’ve both been reeling in our house, feeling locked inside wondering what we can do about this, and this was one of the ways we knew instantly,” Malik said. “We have to go and we have to show up and talk about this, we have to be there at least to support that.” Spiese expressed his belief that the right to nonviolent protest shouldn’t be taken for granted. “We have to continue to be peaceful and speak, and let our voices be heard while we can,” Spiese said. “Because who knows how much longer we’ll be able to.” The protest follows one that occurred Saturday evening in Burlington, when hundreds gathered in Battery Park, saying they’re angry about incidents of police brutality and the killing of black men and women. The protesters marched to the nearby Burlington Police Headquarters, calling for criminal justice reform. Protesters like Fern Thompson, said racism has existed in our country for far too long. “I’m here to protest every single black person that has been killed at the hands of white supremacists, cops, one and the same,” Thompson said. “It’s been going on for as long as we’ve been a country, and it shouldn’t be going on any more and it just needs to stop.” Also over the weekend, Vergennes Police Chief George Merkel, president of the Vermont Association of Chiefs of Police, wrote that he is saddened and outraged over the death o Floyd. The Vermont State Police have also been vocal, condemning the actions of the four Minneapolis police pfficers involved as “beyond disturbing.”",0.0

Fitzgerald's letter to the community is especially intriguing. Fitzgerald asserts that ""We have a professional duty to protect and serve everyone in the community with dignity and respect."" But just today, President Trump called on the nation's governors to ""dominate"" the protesters. He accused the protesters of being ""terrorists"" and he urged the governors that ""You have to do retribution."" This is a good opportunity to ask Governor Scott what his approach would be if the administration were to follow through on Trump's remarks.

I carried a sign reading ""Ask me about Michael Santiago."" Due to the noise and social distancing, I had little opportunity to explain. On April 4, 2014, at 5:30 a.m., an officer of Brattleboro Police Department shot and killed Michael Santiago in a motel room at America's Best Inn during the execution of a search warrant for drugs. After breaking down the door and shouting ""show your hands,"" Santiago was shot twice for not complying to the satisfaction of the officer. It turned out Santiago was unarmed. The state investigation determined the homicide was justified. I have thought about this killing frequently over the past six years, as Michael Brown, Eric Garner, Tamir Rice, Walter Scott, George Floyd and countless other unarmed individuals have been killed by police. I know the Brattleboro officer who killed Santiago. I worked with him on revising the BPD use of force policy after the BPD tased two non-violent demonstrators on Putney Road in 2006. He is a decent man. My conclusion is that there is something very wrong with police training. I read Chief Fitzgerald's letter to the community after the George Floyd murder.
