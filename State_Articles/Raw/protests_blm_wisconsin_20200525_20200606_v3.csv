Homeowners can protect themselves by: use local reputable companies, ask for references of previous work and check on satisfaction of that work have a signed written contract listing the products to be used. WISCONSIBN – The Wisconsin Department of Health Services reports of all patient results from the last 24 hours, 4.8% of tests show positive COVID-19 cases. That’s a 1% decrease since Wednesday as the state saw its all-time high for testing. For the first time, tests processed surpassed 10,000—at 10,626.   However, that also meant 512 new COVID-19 cases. Eleven more deaths were reported bringing the state’s total to 550. In central and north central Wisconsin Adams, Iron, Marathon, Waupaca and Wood counties have reported one death. Four deaths have been reported in Clark County.  The state now has 56 labs processing tests. DHS also reported 31 more labs are being on boarded for future testing. The percentage of hospitalized dropped by 1% from Wednesday. That means 14% of COVID patients were hospitalized for a total of 2,452. As of Thursday, 220,715 have tested negative for COVID-19 and 16,974 have tested positive.   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Thick smoke hovered over Minneapolis on Friday, hours after cheering protesters torched a police station that officers abandoned as a third night of protests flared over the death of George Floyd, a handcuffed black man who pleaded for air as a white police officer knelt on his neck. Police evacuated the 3rd Precinct station, the focus of many of the protests, late Thursday to protect employees, a spokesman said. Livestream video showed protesters entering the building, where intentionally set fires activated smoke alarms and sprinklers. President Donald Trump threatened action, prompting a warning from Twitter for “glorifying violence.” Dozens of fires were also set in nearby St. Paul, where nearly 200 businesses were damaged or looted. Protests spread across the U.S., fueled by outrage over Floyd’s death, and years of violence against African Americans at the hands of police. Demonstrators clashed with officers in New York and blocked traffic in Columbus, Ohio, and Denver. Trump threatened to bring Minneapolis “under control,” calling the protesters “thugs” and tweeting that “when the looting starts, the shooting starts.” The tweet drew another warning from Twitter, which said the comment violated the platform’s rules, but the company did not remove it. MADISON, Wis. (WEAU) Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul issued a statement on Friday on the death of George Floyd that has caused unrest in Minneapolis.  “What America witnessed happening to George Floyd in Minneapolis was not, in any true sense of the phrase, law enforcement. It was torture and murder, under color of law,” said AG Kaul. “Justice demands that those involved in this depraved crime be prosecuted to the full extent of the law.”","http://wldywjbl.co/2020/05/wldy-wjbl-news-5-29-20-cooler-and-dry-weather-has-arrived-behind-a-cold-front-and-as-an-upper-trough-takes-hold-of-the-state-this-will-promote-the-development-of-som/","en","True","","664106","WLDY","http://wldywjbl.co/"
